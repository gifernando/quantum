Density functional theory and the Grimme-D2 approach in spin polarization mode are employed. It is concluded that Ag and X are adsorbed on CNT80 in the dimer form rather than singly atomic adsorption. The spin-distinct electronic band structure and the densities of states are also calculated. The calculations show that Ag-Pd/CNT80 is a bipolar semiconductor with an energy gap of 0.27 eV for spin-up, 0.47 eV for spin-down, and 0.15 eV for spin-flip electrons. Ag-Pt/CNT80 is an anti-ferromagnetic p-type indirect semiconductor with a gap of 0.187 eV for temperatures below 188 K. After 188 K up to around 330 K, this structure converts to an indirect bipolar semiconductor, with an energy gap of 0.31 eV (0.37 eV) for the spin-up (down) channel. Adsorption of Ag dimer onto CNT80 leads to the p-type nonmagnetic semiconductor. As an application of the proposed materials, the absorption of CO as a polar molecule on the Ag-Pd/CNT80 structure is also investigated, and a proposed structure as a spintronic CO sensor is introduced. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","(8,0) single-wall carbon nanotube; Adsorption; Bipolar magnetic semiconductor; Density functional theory; Spintronic materials","Adsorption; Dimers; Energy gap; Magnetic semiconductors; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN); Spin polarization; (8,0) single-wall carbon nanotube; Bipolar magnetic semiconductor; Density-functional-theory; DFT study; Electronic and magnetic properties; P-type; Single Wall; Spin-up; Spintronics application; Spintronics materials; Density functional theory","","","Z.K.

In this study, we adopted Ru heteroatom doping and an open nanoframe structure to obtain excellent HER catalytic performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) visualized the electron transfer due to Ru heteroatom doping in transition metal phosphides, to observe the modulated electronic structure of the Ru-doped CoFeP nanoframe (RCFP/NF). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and XPS analysis confirmed a D-band center downshift of the RCFP/NF, demonstrating the regulation of the optimal adsorbates (OH*/H*) adsorption free energies. Consequently, RCFP/NF with 4.7 wt % of Ru exhibits a low overpotential of 112 mV, 191 mV, and 219 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm−2, 100 mA cm−2, and 500 mA cm−2, respectively, and an excellent stability for 100 h at a high current density of 100 mA cm−2. This outstanding HER performance at high current density was attributed to the hydrophilic and aerophobic properties of the RCFP/NF catalyst surface that facilitate the exposure of active sites and H2 gas desorption. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Alkaline hydrogen evolution; Electronic structure; High current density; Ruthenium doping; Transition metal phosphide","Catalyst activity; Cobalt compounds; Cost effectiveness; Current density; Electrocatalysts; Electronic structure; Hydrogen; Iron compounds; Phosphorus compounds; Ruthenium compounds; Transition metals; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Alkaline hydrogen evolution; Alkalines; Electronic.structure; Heteroatoms; High current densities; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Hydrogen-evolution; Nanoframes; Ruthenium doping; Transition metal phosphide; Density functional theory","National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, MSIT, (- 2023M3H4A1A03061436, 2021M3D1A2051636)","This work was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT , South Korea (NRF- 2023M3H4A1A03061436 , 2021M3D1A2051636 ).

For N particles with onsite attractive energy U and hopping amplitude between sites t, Cat states exist for u≡UN2t<-1 at zero temperature. However, they are increasingly unstable to small thermal fluctuations as the Cat itself is increasingly well-defined and its components become well-separated. For any given u< - 1 , the decoherence temperature becomes smaller for large N. The loss of off-diagonal coherence peaks in the equilibrium density matrix is dominated by the thermal admixture of the first excited state of the many-body system with its ground state. Particle number fluctuations, described in the grand canonical ensemble also reduce coherence, but to a lesser degree than thermal fluctuations. The full density matrix of the Schrödinger Cat is obtained by exact numerical diagonalization of the many-body Hamiltonian and a narrow regime in the parameter space of the particle number, temperature, and U/t is identified where small Cat states may survive decoherence in a physical environment. © 2023, The Author(s).","","article","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","This work was supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

Magnetic regenerator materials of rare earth compound which have sufficient specific heat enabled cryocooler to reach below 4 K. However, the magnetic noise emitted from the magnetic materials during the refrigeration cycle affects the performance of noise-sensitive devices. In this study, we propose a non-magnetic regenerator material having “optical phonon degree of freedom” even at cryogenic temperatures, in which silver oxide (Ag2O) is selected. Ag2O decomposes at temperature above 410 K in ambient atmosphere, whereas we succeeded in fabricating a sintered Ag2O bulk and small particles of the size of 0.5 mm with high-density more than 90%. Specific heat measurement down to 100 mK was performed for the sintered bulk sample of Ag2O. Below 10 K, a non-Debye behavior was observed, suggesting the contribution from optical phonon modes. Calculation of the phonon density of state (phDOS) performed by the Evolution Strategy algorithm in addition to the first-principles calculation reveals that phDOS has several distinct peaks at low energies, and the low-energy optical phonons contribute to the non-Debye behavior. The low temperature specific heat of Ag2O enhanced by the optical phonons is larger than conventional non-magnetic regenerator materials when compared in terms of specific heat per volume. Moreover, the calculation of cooling performance of cryocooler using Ag2O particles is found to be reached below 4.2 K. This study shows that non-magnetic material with low temperature specific heat enhanced by optical phonon mode can be used as a regenerator material for regenerative cryocoolers. © 2023 The Authors","Cryocooler; Optical phonon; Regenerator material","Atmospheric temperature; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Magnetic refrigeration; Sintering; Specific heat; Cryocoolers; Cryogenic temperatures; Debye behavior; Magnetic regenerators; Non-Debye; Nonmagnetics; Optical phonon modes; Optical phonons; Phonon density of state; Regenerator materials; Rare earths","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP21H01267); National Institute for Materials Science, NIMS","The authors acknowledge Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP21H01267).

The calculated adsorption energies indicate CH4 and H2 as final products, which is consistent with experimental observations. A detailed analysis of reaction pathways with measured and computed data indicates partial desorption of CH3CHO and CO, with both processes occurring simultaneously and rapidly. We found that the latter is not preceded by the formation of surface CO species and results from: (1) a kinetic process due to the high activation barrier for C–C bond breaking during the ethanol degradation process and (2) an initial CO configuration that favors its desorption. Besides deciphering the new mechanism, our calculations validate previously suggested degradation pathways and show that the combination of experiment and simulations is an effective approach to improve our understanding of catalytic reactions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","ab initio calculations; Acetaldehyde decomposition; C-supported precious metal catalyst; Ethanol dehydrogenation; Ethanol up-grading","Catalysis; Catalysts; Dehydrogenation; Desorption; Grading; Ab initio calculations; Acetaldehyde decomposition; Adsorption energies; C-supported precious metal catalyst; CH 4; Ethanol dehydrogenation; Ethanol up-grading; Precious-metal catalysts; Pt catalysts; Up-grading; Ethanol","JARA-CSD","We acknowledge the computational resources on RWTH Aachen University and Forschungszentrum Jülich provided by JARA-CSD.","P.M.

To achieve this, we commence by transforming each original graph into a family of k-level neighborhood graphs, where each k-level neighborhood graph encapsulates the connected information between each vertex and its k-hop neighbor vertices, providing a fine representation to reflect the multi-level topological information for the original global graph structure. To further capture the complicated structural characteristics of the original graph through its neighborhood graphs, we propose to characterize the structure of each neighborhood graph with the Average Mixing Matrix (AMM) of the CTQW, that encapsulates the time-averaged behavior of the CTQW evolved on the neighborhood graph. More specifically, we show how the AMM matrix allows us to compute a Quantum Shannon Entropy for each vertex, and thus compute an entropic signature for each neighborhood graph by measuring the averaged value or the Jensen–Shannon Divergence between the entropies of its vertices. For each original graph, the resulting QBER is defined by gauging how the entropic signat ures vary on its k-level neighborhood graphs with increasing k, reflecting the multi-dimensional entropy-based structure information of the original graph. Experiments on standard graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed QBER approach in terms of the classification accuracies. The proposed approach can significantly outperform state-of-the-art entropic complexity measuring methods, graph kernel methods, as well as graph deep learning methods. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Entropic representations; Graph embedding; Graph entropy; Quantum walks","Classification (of information); Continuous time systems; Deep learning; Graph embeddings; Graph structures; Graph theory; Attributed graphs; Continuous-time quantum walks; Entropic representation; Graph embeddings; Graph entropy; Mixing matrix; Multilevels; Neighborhood graphs; Quantum walk; Topological information; Graphic methods","National Social Science Foundation Major Project of China, (ZD145); Program for Innovation Research in the Central University of Finance and Economics; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61602535, 61976235, 62172370, T2122020, U21A20473); China Scholarship Council, CSC; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LY22F020004); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (62206321, 71972194)","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants T2122020 , 61976235 , and 61602535 .

Herein, employing spin-polarized density functional theory, we looked into the effect of non-metal doping (B, C, N, O, and F) and Fe-non metal co-doping on structure, electronic, and magnetic properties of 2H–MoTe2 to identify new promising configurations for spin-based device applications. For non-metal doping, the results depict that B, N, and F-doped systems are magnetic, and the N-doped system shows magnetic-semiconducting behavior. The half-metallic Fe-doped MoTe2 transforms into a magnetic semiconductor upon co-doping. The structural distortion around the Fe atoms modifies the crystal field splitting, resulting in triply degenerate a1 and singly degenerate a2 and a3 states. Uncompensated electrons in the co-doped system and hybridization between Fe and NM atom modifies the magnetic properties of monolayer MoTe2. Competition between crystal field splitting and intra-atomic Hund's exchange splitting determines the magnetic moment. Due to charge compensation, C-doped and Fe–C co-doped systems are non-magnetic. N-doped and Fe–N co-doped MoTe2 exhibit long-range magnetic ordering. Formation energy calculations revealed that the co-doped configurations are easily attainable in experiments compared to non-metal doped systems. The results open up a robust way to realize 2H–MoTe2 based spintronic devices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","2H–MoTe<sub>2</sub>; Dilute magnetic semiconductors; Ferromagnetic coupling; Fe–NM codoping; NM-doping","Crystal atomic structure; Density functional theory; Diluted magnetic semiconductors; Iron; Magnetic moments; Magnetic properties; Molybdenum compounds; Monolayers; Semiconductor doping; Tellurium compounds; 2h–mote2; Co-doped; Co-doping; Dilute magnetic semiconductors; Doped systems; Electronic and magnetic properties; Ferromagnetic coupling; Fe–NM codoping; NM-doping; Non-metals; Atoms","Ministry of Information Technology; Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, IITH; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST; Ministry of Education, India, MoE; Ministry of Electronics and Information technology, Meity","We acknowledge the National Supercomputing Mission (NSM) for providing computing resources of ‘PARAM SEVA’ at IIT, Hyderabad, which is implemented by C-DAC and supported by the Ministry of Information Technology (MeitY) and Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India .

However, low energy density is a significant shortcoming for their implications in practical applications. The performance of the SCs is based on rate capability, specific capacitance, power, and energy densities. To deal with the problem of low energy density, novel electrode materials with high stability and capacitance are urgently required. The electrical and electrochemical properties of electrode materials heavily influence their overall performance. The density functional theory (DFT) has significantly contributed to studying electrical properties, which provides a strong tool for screening the electrode materials of SCs. This review aims to provide recent advances in different theoretical techniques to improve and screen out the best electrode materials for SCs. We summarized theoretical calculations of various electrode material families, including metal oxides (MOs), metal sulfide/selenides/phosphides, metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), etc., and evaluated their performance and outlined their DFT calculations. We also highlight the literature based on DFT calculations of the materials with possible approaches to tune the electrical properties to achieve high–performance electrode materials for SCs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Density functional theory; Electrochemical performance; Electronic properties; Redox kinetics; Supercapacitor","Capacitance; Carbides; Density functional theory; Electrochemical electrodes; Electronic properties; Life cycle; Sulfur compounds; Transition metals; Density-functional theory calculations; Density-functional-theory; Electrochemical performance; Electrode material; Energy density; High-power-density; Lower energies; Recent progress; Redox kinetics; Supercapacitor","School of Materials and Energy; School of Physical Science and Technology; Lanzhou University, LZU; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51972153); Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province, (20JR5RA240); Deanship of Scientific Research, King Khalid University, (RGP-2/524/44)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the scientific and technical input and support from the School of Materials and Energy, Lanzhou University, China.

The structural properties reveal the pure structure is more distorted than the defect one. The electronic band structure infers that the pure structure is an n-type semiconductor while the defect one is an intrinsic semiconductor having a larger bandgap as compared to the former due to the cationic vacancy. Both compounds are direct bandgap semiconductors. From the calculation of elastic stiffness constants and elastic moduli, it is found that both the compounds are mechanically stable. The melting temperature of CdInSe2 and CdIn2Se4 are obtained as 831 K and 784 K, respectively. The electronic thermoelectric properties show a higher value of ZT = 0.86 for the ordered vacancy compound (CdIn2Se4) with a fixed hole concentration of 1020 cm−3 at 800K making it competent for the thermoelectric applications. The variation of various thermoelectric coefficients w.r.t. the chemical potential shows that in CdIn2Se4, the p-type doping is favorable to further enhance the thermoelectric behavior. The lattice thermal conductivity for the defect structure is found to be 3.78 W/mK at room temperature and a lowest value of 1.421 W/mK at 800K. The results demonstrate the defect CdIn2Se4 as a promising thermoelectric material. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Carrier relaxation time; Chalcopyrite-type semiconductor; DFT; Electronic band structure; Lattice thermal conductivity; Structural properties; Thermoelectric properties","Cadmium compounds; Copper compounds; Crystal lattices; Density functional theory; Energy gap; Hole concentration; Indium compounds; Semiconducting selenium compounds; Statistical mechanics; Structural properties; Thermal conductivity; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; Ab initio approach; Carrier relaxation time; Chalcopyrite-type; Chalcopyrite-type semiconductor; DFT; Elastic properties; Electronic band structure; Lattice thermal conductivity; Thermoelectric; Thermoelectric properties; Semiconductor doping","Indo-Korea Science and Technology Center; University Grants Commission, UGC, (F.30-522/2020)","Funding text 1: PP would like to thank UGC-BSR for its financial assistance through the Start-up research grant (sanctioned No. F.30-522/2020(BSR)) to carry out this work.

Herein, magnetic induction heating (MIH) is exploited for the rapid preparation of carbon-supported MoSx nanocomposites. The sample prepared at 200 A for 10 s shows an amorphous Mo3S7Cly-like structure and a low overpotential (η10) of −184 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in acidic media, whereas samples prepared at higher induction currents display a largely crystalline MoS2 structure and drastically lower HER performance. This is due to the formation of dimeric Mo6S14 moieties in amorphous MoSx that is facilitated by the loss of Cl residues during electrochemical reaction and enhanced H adsorption at both the S and Mo sites, in comparison to crystalline MoS2, as shown in First-principles calculations.

It is often used to evaluate quantum mechanical tunneling corrections in order to obtain chemical rate constants. To this end, this study focused on extensively examining the effects of perturbations on the magnetic and thermal properties of the Eckart potential. In the presence of magnetic and Aharonov–Bohm fields with Eckart potential, the Schrödinger equation is solved using the functional analysis approach (FAA). The energy equation and wave function are obtained analytically. The energy equation is used to derive expressions for the thermo-magnetic properties of the Eckart potential. An extensive analysis of the effect of these fields and potential parameters on the wave function is presented. In several configurations of the analysis, we observe that the system exhibits a diamagnetic behavior,and the specific heat capacity agree with the Dulong–Petit law.

Furthermore, a thorough exploration encompassed the sensor's intricate fabrication processes, the diverse range of materials employed, the underlying principles of detection, and an in-depth assessment of the sensors' efficacy in detecting glucose levels within essential bodily fluids such as human blood serums, urine, saliva, and interstitial fluids. It is worth noting that the accurate quantification of glucose concentrations within human blood has been effectively achieved by utilizing classical enzymatic sensors harmoniously integrated with optical and electrochemical transduction mechanisms. Monitoring glucose levels in various mediums has attracted exceptional attention from industrial to academic researchers for diabetes management, food quality control, clinical medicine, and bioprocess inspection. There has been an enormous demand for the creation of novel glucose sensors over the past ten years. Research has primarily concentrated on succeeding biocompatible and enhanced sensing abilities related to the present technologies, offering innovative avenues for more effective glucose sensors. Recent developments in wearable optical and electrochemical sensors with low cost, high stability, point-of-care testing, and online tracking of glucose concentration levels in biological fluids can aid in managing and controlling diabetes globally. New nanomaterials and biomolecules that can be used in electrochemical sensor systems to identify glucose concentration levels are developed thanks to advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology. Both enzymatic and non-enzymatic glucose electrochemical sensors have garnered much interest recently and have made significant strides in detecting glucose levels. In this review, we summarise several categories of non-enzymatic glucose sensor materials, including composites, non-precious transition metals and their metal oxides, hydroxides, precious metals and their alloys, carbon-based materials, conducting polymers, metal-organic framework (MOF)-based electrocatalysts, and wearable device-based glucose sensors deeply. © 2023","Diabetes; Electrocatalyst; Glucose sensors; MOF; Nanomaterials; Wearable sensors","Biocompatibility; Blood; Electrochemical sensors; Glucose; Glucose sensors; Molecular biology; Nanoscience; Nanostructured materials; Organometallics; Transition metals; Wearable sensors; alloy; carbon; cobalt; copper; electrolyte; ferric ion; glucose; gold nanoparticle; hydroxide; manganese; metal organic framework; metal oxide; nanomaterial; nickel; palladium; platinum; polymer; silver nanoparticle; 'current; Concentration levels; Electrochemical glucose sensors; Future perspectives; Glucose concentration; Glucose level; Human bloods; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Non-enzymatic; Non-enzymatic glucose sensors; Article; biocompatibility; bioprocess; body fluid; catalyst; clinical medicine; diabetes mellitus; electrocatalyst; food quality; glucose blood level; glucose urine level; health care management; human; interstitial fluid; nanotechnology; optical sensor; pH; point of care testing; saliva level; scientist; Electrocatalysts","Ministry of Education, MOE; SRM Institute of Science and Technology, SRMIST; Department of Chemistry, University of York; National Science and Technology Council, NSTC; Kaohsiung Medical University, KMU, (KMU-TC112A01, NSTC-110-2113-M-037-009-, NSTC-111-2113-M-037-012-)","The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Department of Chemistry, SRM Institute of Science and Technology , Tamil Nadu-603 203, India.

As the pressure increases to 72 GPa, a new A15 Ti3Se structure is predicted and it can be stabilized dynamically at zero pressure. We further investigate the electronic and superconducting properties of A15 Ti3Se. Due to the significant contribution of transition metal d electrons at the Fermi level, the phonon properties of the Ti-lattice considerably enter into the calculation of electron-phonon interactions. The calculated robust superconducting critical temperature Tc (μ∗= 0.10-0.15) is 26-21.34 K under 80 GPa.

The findings indicate that the adsorption process is exothermic in nature, where the As can spontaneously adsorb on different sites of cellulose. The calculated binding energy shows that the As strongly interacts with the hydroxyl and hydroxymethyl group of the cellulose and is minimal on the cellulose's backbone. In all studied configurations, As gained an electronic charge in all four reactive sites and revealed the localization of electrons in the interface of As and cellulose. The electronic band structure shows that the impurity states of the As appear near the Fermi level, thus lowering the bandgap of the cellulose-As systems. Further, the optical absorption spectra of cellulose-As systems revealed new peaks at the visible region. These results suggest cellulose biopolymer can be used as an adsorbent and sensing material for As. © 2023 by the authors.","absorption spectra; adsorption; arsenic; cellulose biopolymer; density functional theory; electronic structure; sensor","","Jose Rizal Memorial State University","This research received support from Jose Rizal Memorial State University through the project ""Exploring the Adsorption of Heavy Metal Compounds on Nanocellulose and Nanocarbons: A First-principles Study"".","A.A.Z.

This fluorescence quenching of MoS2 was successfully utilized to detect Hg2+ ions in both normal (H9c2 cell line) and cancer (A549 cell line) cells as well via fluorescence imaging microscopy. The as-synthesized MoS2 nanostructured sample was characterized using UV–vis absorption, steady-state fluorescence emission, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The strong fluorescence emission of nanostructured MoS2 was heavily quenched by Hg2+ ions in aqueous medium as confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopic results. The binding of Hg2+ with MoS2 nanoflakes and the resulting fluorescence quenching were also supported by Stern–Volmer analysis. The selectivity and sensitivity of the interaction of Hg2+ ions with the as-prepared MoS2 nanoflakes among all other interfering metal ions were analyzed. The selective interaction of Hg2+ with MoS2 was also accompanied by a distinct color change from bluish-green to flaxen or pale yellowish-gray in aqueous medium. The limit of detection of Hg2+ ions in aqueous medium was 0.63 nM. The possible interactions between Hg2+ and MoS2 were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence, and cyclic voltammetry studies. Density functional theoretical calculations provided useful information to correlate the electronic structure and energy band distributions with the spectroscopic results for the interaction of Hg2+ with MoS2 nanoflakes. The MoS2 nanoflakes showed no significant cytotoxicity during their interaction with Hg2+ ions in the intracellular medium, as confirmed by MTT assay, thereby ensuring possible future biomedical applications. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Cellular imaging; DFT; L-cysteine; Metal ion sensing; MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflakes","Amino acids; Cell culture; Cyclic voltammetry; Density functional theory; Electronic structure; Field emission microscopes; Fluorescence imaging; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrothermal synthesis; Layered semiconductors; Medical applications; Mercury (metal); Mercury compounds; Metal ions; Scanning electron microscopy; Aqueous media; Cellular imaging; DFT; Fluorescence quenching; L-cysteine; Mercury ion; Metal ion sensing; MoS2 nanoflake; Nano-flakes; Nano-structured; Molybdenum compounds","SERB DST, (SB/EMEQ-142/2014); West Bengal State Council of Science and Technology, (493/WBSCST/F/0545/15(Pt–I)); Jadavpur University, JU; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST, (CRG/2020/000348)","Funding text 1: P.M.

In this study, based on Density-Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT), we investigated the dependency of the phonon properties such as phonon frequencies, dielectric constant, Born effective charge, and vibrational modes of SnSe and SnSe2 monolayers to the different types of PPs. On the basis of Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) using PBE functional, we computed eight phonon calculations for both lattices in combinations with four different PPs including Normconversing (NC) FHI/HGH, Ultrasoft (USPP), and Standard Solid-State (SSSP), while other parameters like cut-off energy, k-points mesh, and convergence threshold were kept fixed. However, the phonon properties of acoustic and optical phonons were better predicted by USPP and SSSP for phonon dispersion of SnSe and SnSe2, respectively. Regarding the dielectric constant and Bohr effective charge calculations, our results showed that SnSe and SnSe2 structures possess the dielectric tensor of 8.9 and 6.6 along the in-plane direction by using USPP calculations. Our outcomes also revealed less sensitivity of SnSe2 polarization to the type of PPs by applying the electric field. This study recommends USPP and SSSP to further phonon analysis of other semiconductors. © 2023","2D materials; Dielectric tensor; First-principle calculation; Phonon properties; Pseudopotential; SnSe; SnSe<sub>2</sub>","Density functional theory; Dielectric materials; Electric fields; Layered semiconductors; Monolayers; Perturbation techniques; Phonons; Tensors; Tin compounds; 2d material; Atomistic calculations; Born effective charge; Density-functional perturbation theory; Dielectric tensors; First principle calculations; Phonon frequencies; Phonon properties; Pseudopotentials; Vibrational modes; Selenium compounds","CINECA-HPC, (HP10CEE3EH)","This work is part of the research of HORIZON-EIC-2022-PATHFINDEROPEN-01 “Nano-scale Development of Plasmonic Amplifiers Based on 2D Materials” (PLASNANO) (grant agreement No. 101099552).

Yet, there remains a paucity of research focusing on the migration and release processes of radionuclides combined with colloids associated with the repository, e.g., granite, and especially fracture-filling materials (FFMs). Further, the impact of heterogeneity on radionuclide migration in these media remains unclear. Thus, laboratory-scale column experiments were conducted to explore the migration behaviors of Eu(III) and bentonite colloids (BCs) in both homogeneously and heterogeneously configured columns. It was observed that the migration of BCs can be influenced by the configuration of media and ionic strength of solution. FFMs exhibited a higher retardation capacity for BCs than granite, and the retention ability of the heterogenous media (Granite-FFMs) was intermediate between that of granite and FFMs. The retardation of BCs increased with increasing ionic strength. Despite the “irreversibility” of Eu(III) adsorption on these media with insensitivity on ionic strength, the presence of BCs can grab the immobilized Eu(III) and carry more amount of adsorbed Eu(III) into the mobile phase at higher ionic strength. Even with the rinse of BCs flow, FFMs still revealed a better retardation ability for Eu(III) than granite. These findings are essential for predicting the geological fate and the release risk of radionuclides in the Beishan repository environment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Colloid facilitated migration; Heterogeneity effects; HLW disposal; Radionuclides migration","Europium compounds; Geological repositories; Granite; Ionic strength; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Radioisotopes; Sols; bentonite; europium; Beishan granites; Colloid facilitated migration; Filling materials; Fracture filling; Heterogeneity effects; Heterogeneous media; HLW disposal; Homogeneous media; Radionuclides migrations; Repository environments; adsorption; bentonite; granite; heterogeneous medium; numerical model; petrogenesis; petrology; radionuclide; adsorption; Article; chemical migration; chemical phenomena; colloid; concentration (parameter); controlled study; density functional theory; desorption; flow; fracture filling material; geographic and geological phenomena; geological fate; granite; ionic strength; mobile phase; particle size; physical phase; porosity; prediction; safety; surface area; Bentonite","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (22276003); Peking University, PKU","Funding text 1: We are grateful for the financial support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 22276003).

In this work, thermal transport properties of van der Waals heterostructures formed by vertical stacking of monolayers GeS and SnS have been investigated systematically based on machine learning interatomic potential. The effect of van der Waals interface on the lattice thermal transport of 2D SnS and GeS can be well clarified by introducing various stacking configurations. Our results indicate that the van der Waals interface can strongly suppress the thermal transport capacity for the considered heterostructures, and either the average thermal conductivity per layer or the 2D thermal sheet conductance for the considered heterostructures is lower than that of corresponding monolayers. The suppressed thermal conductivity with tunable in-plane anisotropy in SnS/GeS heterostructures can be ascribed to the enhanced interface anharmonic scattering, and thus exhibits obvious interface-dependent characteristics. Therefore, this work highlights that the van der Waals interface can be employed to effectively modulate thermal transport for the 2D puckered group-IV monochalcogenides, and the suppressed lattice thermal conductivity together with interface-dependent phonon transport properties in the SnS/GeS heterostructure imply the great potential for corresponding thermoelectrical applications. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","GeS; machine learning; SnS; thermal conductivity; van der Waals heterostructure","Crystal lattices; IV-VI semiconductors; Layered semiconductors; Machine learning; Monolayers; Thermal conductivity; Van der Waals forces; Interatomic potential; Machine-learning; On-machines; Stacking configurations; Thermal transport; Thermal transport properties; Two-dimensional materials; Van der Waal; Van der waal heterostructure; Vertical stacking; anisotropy; article; machine learning; phonon; thermal conductivity; Tin compounds","Scientific Research Plan Projects of Shaanxi Education Department, (21JK0539)","This work was supported by Scientific Research Plan Projects of Shaanxi Education Department (No. 21JK0539).

The CsTaO3 was previously reported dynamically stable through optimization of energy against volume and phonon properties at ambient pressure conditions, having wide (direct) energy gap of 2.90 eV. This gap is decreasing with increasing pressure and behaves like the interesting diluted magnetic semiconductors. The comprehensive insights of the imaginary part of dielectric constant is predicting it's utility in optoelectronic devices and sensors.

The quantum capacitance of monolayer models was enhanced through a single doping, a triple doping, and a vacancy defect. Our calculations suggested that the layer interactions within the trilayer models decreased the quantum capacitance but increased the stability of the doped structures. Interestingly, in the case of sulfur dopants with significantly larger atomic size than carbon, the stacking layers induced a surface distortion that could avoid the steric clashes with stacking layers and enhanced the stability.

One of the most important bottlenecks that arises when developing and maintaining an interface of a library with an already existing software, is to keep it aligned with the development route of the latter. This might include significant changes, such as changes in the data structures used by the library, which are communicated through the interface. In this paper, an approach for inserting a new algorithm into existing software is presented, through a minimally invasive interface, that takes over an already present algorithm, and thus changes its original purpose. The approach is applied to the well-established Activation-Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) algorithm, that is revisited and re-engineered to bias and take over the FIRE minimization algorithm, as presently implemented in two community codes for atomistic simulations, namely Quantum ESPRESSO (PWscf) and LAMMPS. ARTn is a well established single-ended saddle-point search algorithm that allows for the exploration of potential energy surfaces. The resulting algorithm acts as a plugin, and is distributed in the form of an external library (pARTn).

Solution method: Full refactoring and re-engineering into a library, which utilizes and biases a minimization algorithm already implemented in the engine, to make it behave as ARTn. The biasing is done by reverse-engineering specific external conditions that drive the displacement of atoms. © 2023","Chemical reaction; Potential energy surface; Saddle point; Transition state","Application programming interfaces (API); C++ (programming language); Codes (symbols); Digital storage; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Software design; Software testing; Surface reactions; Atomistic simulations; Minimally invasive; Minimization algorithms; Plug-ins; Potential-energy surfaces; Relaxation techniques; Saddle point; Saddle point search algorithms; Single-ended; Transition state; Chemical activation","CALMIP, (P1418); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","Funding text 1: N.M.'s work is supported in part by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada .

This interest is fueled by the improvements in hardware, software, and algorithms needed for its practical application and the promise that it holds for the future acceleration of computational workloads compared to classical computing. Due to its true quantum nature, the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm is one of many methods that has garnered much attention lately. Simulating it requires much memory and is unsolvable on systems with average system sizes. Another algorithm known as Kitaev's algorithm or iterative quantum phase estimation algorithm (IQPE) functions with a single control qubit, which is its primary benefit over QPE. Recently another approximate IQPE (AIPE) approach was proposed in Shokri et al. (2021) for faster calculations than traditional IQPE. In order to evaluate the energy eigenvalues of several quantum mechanical systems, such as the finite square well potential (SWP) and harmonic oscillator(HO), by solving the Schrödinger equations, we developed both the traditional IQPE and AIPE techniques in this study using our own Python programs on IBM Qiskit. Our simulations of the systems with a fair inaccuracies relative to the actual values are supported by our findings from running the quantum circuits. Interestingly we found for SWP, AIPE performs better, whereas for the HO, traditional IQPE performs better than the AIPE approach.

Compared to other Bi2O2X, Bi2O2Te has not acquired significant attention due to the difficulty of synthesizing stable composition. Here in this report, we have used “microwave-assisted synthesis method” to prepare bismuth oxytelluride samples with varying synthesis conditions. A few sharp and well-defined diffraction peaks were observed from crystallographic studies, along with several binary phases. Nanosheet-like morphology was observed for different as-prepared samples. The elemental mapping confirms the presence of Bi, O, and Te in the synthesized samples. In the UV-Vis absorption spectra, a redshift with the variation of synthesis conditions was observed, suggesting the presence of more acceptor states. The calculated bandgap energies display the wide bandgap nature of the samples. A broad photoluminescence emission spectrum with peaks centered around orange-red regions was observed for individual nanosheet cases, making them useful for various optoelectronic applications. The temperature and frequency-dependent dielectric measurements were carried out for the possible application in energy storage. The obtained conductivity of the samples is suitable for different electrical applications. The computational analysis using the DFT method was carried out to provide some necessary information about the structure and physical properties of the prepared materials. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Te; Bismuth oxychalcogenide; DFT study; Dielectric properties; Microwave-assisted synthesis; Optoelectronic applications; Wide bandgap","Computational methods; Dielectric properties; Emission spectroscopy; Energy gap; Nanosheets; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Bismuth oxychalcogenide; DFT study; Dielectric application; Dielectrics property; Experimental approaches; Microwave assisted synthesis; Optoelectronic applications; Oxychalcogenides; Synthesis conditions; Wide-band-gap; Bismuth compounds","","","S.

The adsorption energies show that the hollow site provides a more stable configuration with respect to the top and bridge sites, and, in this position, the lead adatom is more energetically favourable than the iron adatom. On the other hand, lead adsorbed in the hollow site of the iron (100) surface doped with chromium, provides more stable system than the nickel doped surfaces with an iron atom adsorbed in the same position. Detailed investigations of inter-layer distances, bonding mechanisms in terms of the projected density of states, magnetic behaviours, and charge density differences are also presented.

In recent years, the on-surface synthesis of different MPcs has been demonstrated via deposition of atomic species, sample heating and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) manipulation. However, the spontaneous substitution of the central metal atom with a substrate one, known as transmetalation, remains a less explored process. Here, we study the transmetalation of ZnPc on Al(100) using a combination of STM and density functional theory (DFT) computations. Previously published X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data indicate the absence of Zn atoms from the interface, while our STM images show that a central atom is still present. This suggests that the transmetalation process occurs spontaneously for all ZnPc molecules. Our DFT calculations reveal that the transmetalation of Zn with Al releases 2 eV per molecule, providing thermodynamic evidence for the process. The on-surface synthesized aluminium phthalocyanine (AlPc) molecules are stabilised by the formation of a bond between the central metal atom and the substrate, similar to that found in chloroaluminium phthalocyanine (ClAlPc), with the consequent suppresion of the paramagnetism of free AlPc. © 2023 The Author(s)","Aluminium-phthalocyanine; Electronic and magnetic properties; Scanning tunneling microscopy; Surface reaction; Transmetalation","Aluminum; Atoms; Density functional theory; Molecules; Scanning tunneling microscopy; Substrates; Synthesis (chemical); X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Aluminum phthalocyanine; Atomic species; Central metals; Density-functional-theory; Electronic and magnetic properties; Metal atoms; Metalphthalocyanines; Organic macrocycle; Sample heating; Transmetalation; Surface reactions","CINECA; Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS, ARRS, (J1-3007, J2-2514, P1-0112)","Funding text 1: G.F. gratefully acknowledge Giuseppe Mattioli and Matteo Cococcioni for fruitful discussions.

The properties of eutectic solvents that are formed from mixtures of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) and hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) are governed by a complex hydrogen (H) bonded network among their constituents. However, an understanding of the key factors effecting the H-bonding structure and dynamics, and the resulting physical and electrochemical properties at interfaces is still in its infancy. In this study, the influence of the cation's alkyl chain length and the anion chemical identity on the characteristics of the H-bonding network in eutectic solvents were examined. In particular, ESs formed from mixtures of tetraalkylammonium salts as HBAs and ethylene glycol as the HBD were studied. Complementary spectroscopic studies revealed the changes in the solvation environment as a function of the ammonium chain length (C1, C2, C3, and C4) and the anion type (Cl−, Br−, I−). With an increase in the alkyl chain length or a decrease in the electronegativity of halide anions (X−), it was found that the O–H bond length shortens and the H···X− bond elongates in the H-bond (O–H···X−) structure, thus resulting in an increase of the solvated ion size and a decrease in the bulk ionic conductivity. Further, double layer capacitance measurements showed that increased capacitance was correlated with shorter H-bonds in anion solvates. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Deep eutectic solvent; Double layer capacitance; Electrolytes; Hydrogen bond donor/acceptor; Impedance spectroscopy","Capacitance; Capacitance measurement; Chain length; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electronegativity; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Eutectics; Hydrogen bonds; Negative ions; Solvation; Spectroscopic analysis; Alkyl chain lengths; Deep eutectic solvents; Donor/acceptor; Double-layer capacitance; H-bonds; Halide anions; Hydrogen bond acceptors; Hydrogen bond donor/acceptor; Hydrogen bond donors; Impedance spectroscopy; Electrolytes","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Basic Energy Sciences, BES, (DE-SC0019409)","This work was supported as part of the Breakthrough Electrolytes for Energy Storage (BEES), an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences under Award # DE-SC0019409.

However, the diffusion doping in the traditional ionothermal post-treatment of pre-polymerized precursor results in only surface-level K doping. This limitation hinders the effective utilization of the incident light and photogenerated electrons in the deeper bulk, especially the mismatched zone between the depth of light absorption and carrier diffusion length. In this study, K dopants were successfully introduced into the deep bulk of carbon nitride while maintaining the integrity of heptazine skeleton structure by treating exfoliated nanosheets. Compared to the superficially doped counterpart, both experiments and theoretical calculations indicate the deeper K dopants not only activate the bulk light harvest and facilitate carrier separation, but also fabricate an efficient electron transfer bridge. This bridge is responsible for extracting the electrons to the surface, thus facilitating the O2 reduction reaction. Consequently, a 139-fold enhancement in the H2O2 production rate over pristine carbon nitride was achieved, surpassing the performance of most recently reported photocatalysts. This study would deepen the understanding of the role of bulk doping and stimulate the development of doping beyond the superficial zone. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Deeper bulk K doping; Graphitic carbon nitride; Photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production","Electron transitions; Incident light; Light absorption; Deep bulk K doping; Efficient strategy; Electron transfer; Graphitic carbon nitrides; Incident light; K-doping; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic H2O2 production; Photocatalytic performance; Post treatment; Carbon nitride","Basic Research Projects of Hebei Universities, (KY2022009); Shiyanjia Lab; Talents Introduction Plan of Hebei Agricultural University, (YJ201935); Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province, (B2021204008, E2020204034)","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province ( B2021204008 , E2020204034 ), Talents Introduction Plan of Hebei Agricultural University ( YJ201935 ), Basic Research Projects of Hebei Universities ( KY2022009 ).

However, the insufficient investigation of interunit C–C bond fragmentation has obstructed the rational design of efficient photocatalytic system and further limit the yields of aromatic monomers from lignin depolymerisation. Herein, this work developed the ultrathin g-C3N4 with multiple defective sites by simple self-assembly process and in-situ thermal gas-shocking/etching process to catalyse the cleavage of lignin C–C bonds under visible light irradiation. Compared with the pristine g-C3N4, the developed g-C3N4 photocatalyst exhibited a superior catalytic activity (improved 102 %) and selectivity (∼90 %) in the cleavage of C–C bonds in lignin. This study demonstrated that the defects construction and ultrathin structure can optimise the electronic structures of g-C3N4 for better separation and transfer of photoinduced charges. And the control experiments and DFT calculation indicated that the created defect sites can promote the generation of essential reactive radicals (e.g., the activation of O2) and radical intermediates (C–H activation). The present work provides useful insights for the rational use of defect engineering in designing the efficient photocatalytic system for the conversion of lignin into aromatic monomers via the C–C bond cleavage. © 2023 The Author(s)","C–C bond cleavage; Graphitic carbon nitride; Lignin conversion; Photocatalysis","Aromatic Compounds; Bond Cleavage; Conversion; Defects; Monomers; Processes; Sites; Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Carbon nitride; Catalyst activity; Chemical activation; Defects; Design for testability; Electronic structure; Monomers; Photocatalytic activity; Bond cleavages; C-C bonds; C–C bond cleavage; Defect sites; Graphitic carbon nitrides; Lignin conversion; Lignin depolymerization; Monomerics; Photo-catalytic; Ultra-thin; Lignin","UK research council EPSRC, (EP/V041665/1, EP/WP027593/1); University of Edinburgh, ED","Funding text 1: X.

The content level of GABA is related to the different degree of malignancy gliomas. Thus, it can be considered a promising glioma biomarker. In this paper, the spectroscopic properties of GABA have been characterized by combining the THz spectroscopy with low-wavenumber Raman spectroscopy. The experimental results showed that, GABA exhibited three absorption peaks and three refractive index peaks in the range of 0.6–2.1 THz. The limit of detection can reach up to 0.428 % based on the absorption coefficient at the peak of 2.04 THz. Moreover, the low-wavenumber Raman spectrum of GABA showed seven characteristic peaks at 41.0, 50.8, 58.8, 77.2, 98.8, 115.6, 141.2 cm−1 in 0–150 cm−1 region. Moreover, the THz and low-wavenumber theoretical spectra of GABA were simulated with solid-state density function theory, respectively. The calculated results were in good agreement with the experimental observations. On the basis of calculated result, the vibrational motions of each THz and Raman characteristic modes were quantitatively decomposed by analytical mode-decoupling method, where the contribution percentages of external translation, external librations and intramolecular vibration of each vibration modes were analyzed Furthermore, the low-frequency characteristics of GABA was analyzed by combining the THz and low-wavenumber Raman spectroscopy. It is beneficial for the structural information analysis and quantitative identification of biomarker GABA in early stage diagnosis of glioma. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Low-frequency information; Low-wavenumber Raman spectroscopy; Theoretical analysis; THz spectroscopy; γ-aminobutyric (GABA)","Amino acids; Biomarkers; Density functional theory; Diagnosis; Refractive index; Spectroscopic analysis; Spectrum analysis; Terahertz spectroscopy; Tumors; Vibration analysis; Frequency information; Low-frequency information; Low-wavenumber raman spectroscopy; Lower frequencies; Spectroscopic characteristics; Theoretical analyse; THz spectroscopy; Wave numbers; Γ-aminobutyric (GABA); γ-Aminobutyric acid; Raman spectroscopy","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62175182, 62275193, U22A20123, U22A20353)","This research is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under grant numbers 62175182 , 62275193 , U22A20123 and U22A20353 .

The present DFT study reports a novel dual chromium-anchored tri-vacancy borophene (Cr2/TV-β12) electrocatalyst, which showed high selectivity and stability for CO2RR. A tri-vacancy defect was introduced in β12 borophene to create an 11-membered ring borophene sheet (TV-β12), and 28 different electrocatalysts were explored via doping various transition metals (Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn). Density functional theory simulation results revealed that the Cr2/TV-β12 electrocatalyst adsorbs and activates CO2 efficiently, which was validated by the partial density of states, charge density difference, Bader charge, and crystal orbital Hamilton population analyses. The limiting potential for CO2RR was evaluated to be −0.45 V, against hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (0.57 V), with the main product being formaldehyde. The catalyst showed selectivity towards CO2 reduction and suppressed HER. The usual problem of carbon monoxide poisoning encountered in CO2 reduction was also assessed and a high resistance against the same was established.

Having reliable uncertainty assessment of the forecast enables tools to be deployed to predict new scenarios unobserved before. In this work, we first extend parallel partial Gaussian processes for predicting the vector-valued transition function that links the observations between the current and next time points, and quantify the uncertainty of predictions by posterior sampling. Second, we show the equivalence between the dynamic mode decomposition and the maximum likelihood estimator of the linear mapping matrix in the linear state space model. The connection provides a probabilistic generative model of dynamic mode decomposition and thus, uncertainty of predictions can be obtained. Furthermore, we draw close connections between different data-driven models for approximating nonlinear dynamics, through a unified view of generative models. We study two numerical examples, where the inputs of the dynamics are assumed to be known in the first example and the inputs are unknown in the second example. The examples indicate that uncertainty of forecast can be properly quantified, whereas model or input misspecification can degrade the accuracy of uncertainty quantification. © 2023 The Author(s)","Bayesian prior; Dynamic mode decomposition; Forecast; Gaussian processes; Generative models; Uncertainty quantification","Dynamical systems; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Maximum likelihood estimation; Nonlinear dynamical systems; State space methods; Uncertainty analysis; Bayesian priors; Data-driven model; Dynamic mode decompositions; Forecast; Gaussian Processes; Generative model; Probabilistic forecasts; Uncertainty; Uncertainty assessment; Uncertainty quantifications; Dynamic mode decomposition","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2053423); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; University of California, UC, (DMR-2114081, M23PL5990); Office of Science, SC, (DE-AC02-05CH11231); Basic Energy Sciences, BES; Purdue University, PU, (2137603, 2138259, 2138286, 2138296, 2138307, DE-AC05-00OR22725, PHY230053); Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering, DMSE, (DE-C02-05CH11231)","This research is supported by the National Science Foundation under Award No. 2053423 .

The calculations revealed that cellulose is suitable for the non-covalent functionalization of SWCNT. The interaction of SWCNT with cellulose is mainly classified as physical interaction. This claim is supported by the results of binding energy, equilibrium distances, and charge transfer analysis of the SWCNT and cellulose. The electronic structure of the prototype SWCNT in the cellulose nanocomposite is well maintained, where no visible hybridization of the orbital characters is observed. The calculations explain experimental observations that cellulose is suitable for the noncovalent functionalization of SWCNT. Further calculations show that As and Pb can be trapped by cellulose biopolymer, while Hg indicates weak interaction. A significant reduction of the bandgap of cellulose is observed upon adsorption of As and Pb. These findings show cellulose can be used as an adsorbent sensing material for As and Pb. Overall, the results of this study confirm that cellulose is a promising functional material for SWCNT and a renewable adsorbent material for heavy metals. © 2023 by the authors.","adsorption; carbon nanotubes; cellulose; density functional theory; functionalization; heavy metals; nanocomposite","","Mindanao State University; Premier Research Institute of Science and Mathematics; Asian Institute of Technology, AIT; Department of Science and Technology, Republic of the Philippines, DOST; Philippine Council for Industry, Energy, and Emerging Technology Research and Development, PCIEERD; Iligan Institute of Technology, Mindanao State University, MSU-IIT","Funding text 1: This research is funded by the Department of Science and Technology, Philippine Council for Industry, Energy, and Emerging Technology Research and Development (DOST-PCIEERD) through the research project entitled ""e-Asia JRP: Development of Innovative Based Hybrid Materials by Combination of Endemic South East Asian Biomolecules and Nanocarbons"" and; Funding text 2: The authors would like to acknowledge the Premier Research Institute of Science and Mathematics (PRISM) of Mindanao State University – Iligan Institute of Technology (MSU-IIT) for the computational resources of the first-principles calculations.","A.A.Z.

The calculation result indicates that there exist two preferred ORs, i.e. (001)Al3Ti//(001)Al, [100]Al3Ti//[100]Al and (010)Al3Ti//(010)Al, [100]Al3Ti//[101¯]Al. The periodic models with a specific interface structure and surface slab models on a particular crystallographic plane were proposed to partition the total energy of the Al3Ti compound into its constituent atoms’ energies. The Ti and two kinds of Al atoms (Wyckoff notation 2b and 4d) possess the energy of -119.80325739 Ry, -5.09778518 Ry, and -5.03677683 Ry, respectively. Compared with the Al3Ti total energy of -269.94919247 Ry, the proposed energy partition scheme presents a satisfactory accuracy better than ∼10−7 Ry. Owing to the data of the atom's energy in the solid state, the definite value of surface energy can be obtained whether or not it is a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric surface. The interface energy calculation, which was carried out on all the preferred ORs with all the possible atomic configurations, indicates that the energy-preferred interface possesses the orientation relationship of (001)Al3Ti//(001)Al, [100]Al3Ti//[100]Al. The atomic configuration is that the atoms on the surface of the Al slab face directly to atoms on the second layer of the Al3Ti slab with the Al-Ti terminated surface on account of its lowest interface energy of 0.005 J/m2. The predicted OR agrees well with the previously published experimental results, and the significantly lower interface energy explains the potency of the Al3Ti particle as a heterogeneous nucleation site in the aluminum solidification process. © 2023","Energy decomposition; First-principles calculations; Interface energy; Orientation relationship; Titanium aluminide","Aluminum; Atoms; Nucleation; Titanium; Titanium alloys; Atomic configuration; Energy; Energy decomposition; First principle calculations; Interface energy; Interface property; Orientation relationship; Preferred orientations; Titanium aluminides; Total energy; Binary alloys","","","J.

Due to its exceptional properties such as thermoelectric, optoelectronic, and elastic characteristics, lead-free Ca3PCl3 inorganic perovskites have recently attracted a lot of research attention in the green solar sector. In this study, we have used first-principles density functional theory to thoroughly analyze the strain-driven electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of Ca3PCl3. Band gap measurements at the Г-point of the unstrained planar Ca3PCl3 compound provided a value of 2.109 eV, indicating its direct band gap. However, the band gap of this perovskite may be adjusted upon applying biaxial strain. In addition, the variation in the absorption spectra and the dielectric function with photon energy have been observed to be red-shifted as a result of an increase in compressive strain. On the other hand, a blue shift occurred due to tensile strain. Ca3PCl3 perovskites can be tailored for solar applications due to its mechanical stability and higher degree of ductility, as shown by their strain-induced mechanical properties. Future uses in optoelectronics and solar cell design could benefit from the mechanical and optoelectronic characteristics of Ca3PCl3, which are strain sensitive. © 2023","Electronic properties; Mechanical properties; Optical properties; Perovskite; Strain","Blue shift; Chlorine compounds; Density (specific gravity); Density functional theory; Electronic properties; Energy gap; Mechanical stability; Perovskite solar cells; Red Shift; Solar power generation; Tensile strain; Biaxial strains; Halide perovskites; Higher efficiency; Inorganic halides; Inorganics; Low-costs; Manufacturing techniques; Optical electronics; Optoelectronic characteristics; Simple++; Perovskite","Deanship of Scientific Research, King Khalid University, (RGP 2/368/44)","The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University for funding this work through Large Research Groups Project under grant number RGP 2/368/44 .

The system is solved by expanding the wavefunction in terms of the isotropic harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions and Hydrogen atom eigenfunctions independently, showing that each one results in a prime approximation for different domains of the normalized coupling constant of the relative interactions, suggesting that the combination of the basis is enough to build a well-suited base for the non-approximate problem. The results are compared to previous works that use a model of approximate finite-rage soft-core interaction model of the problem to give insights into the many-body states of strongly correlated ultracold bosons and fermions. We conclude that the proposed three-dimensional approach facilitates the distinction between bosons and fermions while the solutions given by the expansions better define the behavior of the particles for repulsive potentials.

To identify potential single phase HEA candidates, the composition space of the CrCuFeMnNi alloy system, including 1451 alloys, was investigated using the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) method and Thermo-Calc software. The CALPHAD approach successfully predicted an FCC single-phase Cr15Cu5Fe20Mn25Ni35 alloy. Elastic constants and thermal properties of the Cr15Cu5Fe20Mn25Ni35 HEA were determined through DFT calculations using a 100-atom supercell. To validate the DFT calculations, HEA samples were prepared by the arc melting technique, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed a single-phase FCC structure. The DFT calculated elastic constants values satisfied the Born stability conditions for stability of a cubic crystal structure. Pugh's theory indicated that this alloy exhibits ductility and metallic behavior due to its B/G ratio exceeding 1.75 and positive Cauchy pressure. Additionally, Poisson's ratio exceeded 0.26, further confirming its ductile nature. Experimental tests confirmed these findings by measuring bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio. The calculated CV values showed good agreement with experimental data at different temperatures. The linear coefficient of thermal expansion increased rapidly at lower temperatures before becoming linear. Both XRD as well as DFT calculations yielded similar lattice constant results for this HEA. These findings provide insights into various properties of the Cr15Cu5Fe20Mn25Ni35 HEA, including its structural stability, mechanical behavior and thermal characteristics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","CALPHAD; Cr<sub>15</sub>Cu<sub>5</sub>Fe<sub>20</sub>Mn<sub>25</sub>Ni<sub>35</sub> HEA; Density functional theory; High entropy alloys; Single-phase; Thermal properties","Chromium alloys; Computation theory; Copper alloys; Elastic constants; Elastic moduli; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Iron compounds; Manganese alloys; Stability; Structural properties; Thermal expansion; X ray diffraction analysis; Calculation of PHAse diagram; Computational investigation; Cr15cu5fe20mn25ni35 high entropy alloy; Density-functional theory calculations; Density-functional-theory; Experimental investigations; Face-centred cubic; High entropy alloys; Single phasis; Density functional theory","","","K.

In this work, we provide an illustration of a comprehensive materials discovery process for the development of lanthanum-based superconductors without inversion center similar to ZrNiAl. Our approach begins with a comprehensive screening based on the first principles calculations by substituting different element species and materials database. Throughout a series of strict criteria, we expand the range of materials in this family to 35 compounds with superior stabilities which indicate that they are highly likely to be synthesized. Among these compounds we have identified 15 promising candidates with large energy splitting at the Fermi level. Moreover, the conventional superconducting transition temperatures have also been explored, the results show that 30 compounds are superconducting phases. This work may help with the design and the expansion of the viable phase space of La-based ZrNiAl-like materials for investigating novel quantum phenomena in noncentrosymmetric superconductors. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Ab initio calculations; Noncentrosymmetric superconductors; Spin-orbit coupling; Superconductivity","Lanthanum; Superconducting materials; Superconducting transition temperature; Ab initio calculations; Element material; Element species; First principle calculations; High throughput screening; Inversion center; Noncentrosymmetric superconductors; Property; Spin triplet pairing; Spin-orbit couplings; Phase space methods","Foreign Senior Talents Program of Guangdong Province; Scientific Research Foundation for the Introduction of Talent of Zhejiang Ocean University, (11185091722); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51971179, 51971180, 52271037); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (ZDBS-ZRKJZ-TLC021); Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU; Key Science and Technology Program of Shaanxi Province, (2023-JC-ZD-23); Science and Technology Program of Gansu Province, (2019B090905009)","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51971180, 52271037 and 51971179), the Key Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (ZDBS-ZRKJZ-TLC021), Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology program, China ( 2019B090905009 ), Shaanxi Provincial Science and Technology Program, China ( 2023-JC-ZD-23 ), Foreign Senior Talents Program of Guangdong Province, China and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Introduction of Talent of Zhejiang Ocean University (No. 11185091722 ).

During annealing, nitrogen in AlN is replaced by oxygen, and a fraction of replaced nitrogen is trapped at the interstitial sites in AlN, which systematically enhances with an increment in oxygen content.

It has been shown that uniform compression cannot only open the gap due to graphene sheet deformation but also adjust the gap size depending on the compression strength. The maximum gap found was 0.8 eV when the structure was compressed by 8 %, which is confirmed by further analysis of the UV–vis spectrum. Uniform stretching in contrast does not lead to a significant gap opening. The binding energy of the graphene sheet with the molybdenum ditelluride substrate does not change significantly when mechanical stresses are applied. An additional analysis of the Raman and IR spectra will make it possible to determine the degree of compression of graphene on a molybdenum ditelluride substrate in the experiment. In this case, the corresponding modes mainly correspond to vibrations of carbon atoms in the graphene plane or perpendicular to the substrate. The substrate itself does not make a significant contribution to these vibrational modes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Electronic properties; Gap opening; Graphene; Mechanical stress; Molybdenum ditelluride; Optical properties; Substrate","Binding energy; Density functional theory; Graphene; Molybdenum compounds; Optical properties; Substrates; A: semiconductors; Density-functional-theory; Effect of opening; Electronic characteristics; Gap opening; Graphene sheets; Mechanical stress; Optical characteristics; Sheet deformation; Uniform compression; Electronic properties","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (FSWU-2023-0075)","This work was performed using the resources of the high-performance computer centre MEPhI.

The production strategies and characteristics of GNRs in polymer composites are summarized in this paper. Their synthesis is crucial in getting the appropriate qualities and modifying the dimensions of GNRs. Top-down and bottom-up are the two broad ways that have been utilized for the formation of GNRs. Concerning scalability, dimension control, and cost-effectiveness, each method has its own set of pros and cons. The strengths and weaknesses of the various synthesis methods are discussed to illuminate the present state of the art. GNRs possess distinctive electrical properties, a substantial surface area, robust mechanical strength, and efficient thermal conductivity, making them very suitable for enhancing the overall efficacy of polymer composites. Polymer matrices may benefit from GNR changes; the general characteristics of the composites by the distribution and orientation of GNRs inside the polymer matrix.

We provide an in-depth examination of these characteristics and how lead affects them. The adsorption energy, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and electrostatic potentials at the isosurface (EPI) have been studied in detail. Assess the ring dependence of the lead adsorption energy for the hexagonal and pentagonal rings of pristine C36 and B and N impurities at the substitutional site. The adsorption energy for the Pb on pristine C36 is endothermic; however, it is exothermic for the Pb on NB-doped C36 but has different values on the pentagonal and hexagonal rings. The results demonstrate that nitrogen and boron doping significantly increased the Pb atom's adsorption energy when the dopants occupied pentagonal sites. In addition, the bond lengths surrounding the impurity and the bond lengths of Pb atoms placed on pristine C36, BN-doped hexagonal ring, and BN-doped pentagonal ring in C36 are investigated. The electrostatic potential isosurface (EPI) surrounding the BN-doped hexagonal and pentagonal rings of C36 is described. The Mulliken charge transfer analysis demonstrates that the interaction between NB-doped C36 fullerene and lead (Pb) has a substantial effect on the charge transfer process and the reactivity of the doped system towards lead. However, the quantity of charge transmitted depends on the impurity's location on the hexagonal and pentagonal rings. These findings aid in the atomistic understanding of the interaction between a single Pb atom on the surface of C36 and BN-doped C36 at various rings. Our findings not only shed light on the complex interplay between lead and C36 but also offer valuable insights into potential applications in materials engineering and environmental remediation. © 2023 The Author(s)","C36 fullerene; DFT; N and B-doped C36; Pentagon-ring and hexagon ring","","","","S.A.

After the anharmonic phonon renormalization is considered, both phonon frequency and three-phonon phase space become small with the temperature. Meanwhile, the APRN has a greater effect on the acoustic branch and little effect on the optical branch. When three-phonon scattering is considered, the corresponding thermal conductivity is 3518 W/mK (300 K), 1900 W/mK (500 K), and 1122 W/mK (800 K), respectively. After four-phonon scattering is considered, the thermal conductivity of graphene decreases to 1844 W/mK at 300 K, 900 W/mK at 500 K, and 600 W/mK at 800 K, respectively. For three-phonon scattering, the primary scattering channels include ZA + TA → ZO, TA + TA → ZA, LA + LA → ZO, ZA/TA → TA + LA, LA/ZO → ZO + TA, TO → ZA + LA and LO → ZO + LA. About the four-phonon scattering channel, the main contributions originate from X + ZA → ZA + ZA, X + ZA/ZO → ZA + ZO, and X + TA → LA + ZO. The anharmonic phonon renormalization enlarges the strength of electron-phonon coupling, leading to the increase of n-type electric resistance from 24 Ω to 26 Ω at room temperature. This work gives insight into the phonon scattering channel and electrical property via anharmonic phonon renormalization in which normal processes dominate the ph-ph scattering. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Anharmonic phonon renormalization; Electrical property; Graphene; Lattice thermal conductivity; Phonon scattering channel","Boltzmann equation; Electron scattering; Electron-phonon interactions; Phase space methods; Phonon scattering; Thermal conductivity; Anharmonic phonon renormalization; Anharmonic phonons; Boltzmann's transport equations; Electrical transport; Lattice thermal conductivity; Phonon frequencies; Phonon scattering channel; Renormalization; Scattering channels; Three-phonon scattering; Graphene","Program for Creative Research Groups in University of Chongqing, (CXQT19031); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52102089); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing Municipality, (2022NSCQ-MSX4128, CSTC2021jcyj-msxmX0346); Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, CQMEC, (KJQN202001506)","This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant No. 52102089 , the Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing ( CSTC2021jcyj-msxmX0346 , 2022NSCQ-MSX4128 ), the Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission ( KJQN202001506 ),and Program for Creative Research Groups in University of Chongqing (Grant No. CXQT19031 ).","C.

However, the topological origin of this feature remains unclear and its emergence at the 2D limit has not yet been proven experimentally. Herein, we perform a fully self-consistent ab initio analysis to deeply understand magnetic exchange of chromium trihalides in the 2D limit. We compute the orbital dependent magnetic interactions and Curie temperatures under applied biaxial strain. Our results confirm the existence of a gap around the K high-symmetry point in the linear magnon dispersion of CrI3, which originates as a direct consequence of intralayer Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya (DM) interaction. In addition, our orbital resolved analysis reveals the microscopic mechanisms that can be exploited using strain engineering to increase the strength of the DM interaction and thus control the topological gap width in CrI3. This paves the way to the further development of this family of materials as building-blocks for topological magnonics at the limit of miniaturization. © 2023 The Authors","2D magnetism; 2D materials; First-principles; Magnonics; Straintronics","","European Commission, EC, (964396, ERC-2021-StG-101042680 2D-SMARTiES); Generalitat Valenciana, GVA, (CDEIGENT/2019/022, CIDEGENT/2018/004); Universitat de València, 85|86; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (CEX2019-000919-M, PID2020-1171 52RB-100)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the financial support from the European Union ( ERC-2021-StG-101042680 2D-SMARTiES and FET-OPEN SINFONIA 964396 ), the Spanish MICINN (2D-HETEROS PID2020-1171 52RB-100, and Excellence Unit “María de Maeztu” CEX2019-000919-M), and the Generalitat Valenciana (grant CDEIGENT/2019/022 and CIDEGENT/2018/004).

In this study, we synthesized monometallic (Ni and Co), as well as a bimetallic, NiCo embedded mesoporous composite catalysts using a simple one-step method involving meso-macroporous silica, boehmite, nickel acetate, and cobalt acetate. The synthesized range of catalysts (5, 10, 15 wt% Ni, 10 wt% Co, 10 wt% NiCo) were thoroughly characterized by various techniques. The characterization results showed that the present method leads to the growth of nano-catalyst on porous silica surface (M−Al2O3/SiO2, M = Ni, Co, NiCo). These composites exhibited strong metal-support interaction, improved surface and texture properties and significant amount of weak to medium acid sites. The M−Al2O3/SiO2 composite catalysts demonstrated improved catalytic performance in the HDO of oleic acid. At temperature of 375 °C, the conversion trend of catalysts followed the order; 10NiCo-Al2O3/SiO2 (89%) > 10Ni-Al2O3/SiO2 (87%) > 10Co-Al2O3/SiO2 (85%) > 10Ni/SiO2 (81%). Moreover, the yield of C15-C18 hydrocarbons was substantially enhanced at moderate temperature compared to unmodified silica support. Time-on-stream experiments further confirmed the relative stability of the composite catalysts over a period of 20 h. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) ab initio calculations were performed where the adsorption of oleic acid on icosahedral monometallic M13 (M = Co or Ni) and bimetallic Ni2Co2 nanocluster deposited on γ-Al2O3 (1 1 0) support was investigated. The adsorption strength for the most stable conformations followed the order: Ni13/amorphous SiO2 > Ni2Co2/Al2O3 > Co13/Al2O3 > Ni13/Al2O3. Bader charge transfer analysis indicated higher charge transfer at the interfaces of γ-Al2O3 Al2O3(1 1 0) supported catalysts compared to Ni13/amorphous SiO2 surface. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Ab-initio studies; Bimetallicity; Cobalt; Composites; Hydrodeoxygenation; Hydrogen; Nickel; Oleic acid; Selective Deoxygenation","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Binary alloys; Catalyst selectivity; Charge transfer; Cobalt compounds; Density functional theory; Diesel engines; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Nanocatalysts; Nanocomposites; Nickel compounds; Oleic acid; Organometallics; Textures; Ab initio study; Bimetallicity; Composite catalysts; Density-functional-theory; Deoxygenations; Hydrodeoxygenation; Monometallics; Selective deoxygenation; Synthesised; ]+ catalyst; Silica","Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research, KU, (AARE-2019-233, CIRA-2020-077, RC2-2018-024)","Authors acknowledge the financial support for this work from Khalifa University through the grant RC2-2018-024.

These are anisotropy, chemical composition, metamictization, radiation damage, and defects such as vacancy and Frenkel pairs. Careful investigations of such effects require a detailed description at atomic levels. This study focuses on the details of Pb diffusion pathways (anisotropy) at the atomic scale level in perfect zircon lattices for the better understanding of thermo/petro-chronological problems in geosciences. The applications of Density Functional Theory (DFT) combined with both the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method and Transition State Theory (TST) together with Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations provide a reasonable estimate of the activation energy and diffusion of lead (Pb) in a perfect zircon lattice. Results of the tested methodology give the diffusion co-efficient of anisotropic nature in perfect zircon i.e. the activation energies and frequency factors (D0) along the z-axis [001] is 687 kJ/mol and 4.16×10−3cm2/sec, along zx-axis [101]/[011] is 1331 kJ/mol and 8.57×10−4cm2/sec and along the x-axis is 5810 kJ/mol and 8.57×10−4cm2/sec respectively. The Closure temperatures for Pb in perfect zircon lattices are reasonably high for an effective grain size of 60 μm and a cooling history of 10 °C/Ma. This study also demonstrates that the closure temperature is affected not only by the geometry of a given grain, but also by defects and radiation damage. Furthermore, the calculated closure temperatures show poor calibrations with previous experiments of Pb diffusion in natural zircon, implying that radiation damage and vacancies are causing the reduction in Pb diffusion. Therefore, the gap between the computed and experimental results may probably be due to the change in the chemistry of each zircon crystal used in the experiments. This study is useful in characterizing the effect of individual entities on Pb diffusion in zircon, showing good agreement with experiments, and indicating the applicability of DFT + NEB+TST + KMC methods for characterization of Pb diffusion in perfect zircon. © 2023 The Authors","Closure temperature; Density functional theory; Diffusion; Geochronology; Petrochronology; Thermochronology","Activation energy; Anisotropy; Defects; Diffusion; Geochronology; Lattice theory; Monte Carlo methods; Radiation damage; Zircon; Atomistic approach; Band transitions; Chemical compositions; Closure temperatures; Density-functional-theory; Metamictization; Petrochronology; Thermochronology; Transition state theories; Zircon lattices; activation energy; chronology; diffusion; experimental study; geochronology; laboratory method; lead; temperature profile; zircon; Density functional theory","Khushal Khan Khattak University, (386-388/PC/PAB/KKKUK/21); Universität Wien; Higher Education Commision, Pakistan, HEC","This research work is published from the PhD work of the first author.

Despite their widespread use, a general agreement on their primary functioning mechanism is still lacking. The morphology and composition of the ZDDPs phosphate-based tribofilm, which is essential for its lubricant functioning, have been widely studied experimentally. However, the formation process and the relevant driving forces are still largely debated. In particular, it is unclear whether the stress-induced molecular dissociation occurs in the bulk oil or on the substrate. In this work, we employ ab initio density-functional theory simulations to compare ZDDP fragmentation in vacuum and over a reactive substrate, considering the effects of surface oxidation on the dissociation path. To do so, we developed a computational protocol to study the effects of shear stress on molecules. Our results show that the molecular dissociation is endothermic in the absence of a supporting substrate, while in the presence of an iron substrate, it becomes highly energetically favoured. Moreover, the presence of the substrate changes the reaction path, inducing the detachment of organophosphorus units from Zn-S ones. At the same time, surface oxidation reduces the molecule–substrate interaction. These findings provide valuable insights into the early stages of the formation of phosphate-based tribofilms. © 2023 The Author(s)","Density functional theory; Molecular adsorption; Tribology; ZDDP","Additives; Automotive industry; Computation theory; Density functional theory; Dissociation; Molecules; Morphology; Shear flow; Shear stress; Tribology; Van der Waals forces; Zinc compounds; Ab initio study; Antiwear additive; Density-functional-theory; Dialkyldithiophosphate; Ferrous substrate; Molecular adsorption; Molecular dissociation; Surface oxidations; Tribofilms; Zinc dialkyldithiophosphate; Substrates","NextGeneration EU, (CN00000023); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Commission, EC; European Research Council, ERC; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (1033 - 17/06/2022); Horizon 2020, (865633)","Funding text 1: These results are part of the SLIDE project, which received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.

In this paper, we show a low-temperature face-centered-cubic modification of Cu6GeWSe8 (C-phase), which crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group F-43m with four formula in the cell of dimension a = 11.1372(2) Å. In the C-phase, double layers organized by MeSe4 (Me = Cu, Ge and W) tetrahedra alternately stack along the <111> direction. A weakly first-order or nearly second-order displacive phase transition from cubic to hexagonal polytypes undergoes initially at ∼ 440 °C upon increasing temperature. Electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient reveal a semiconductor-like conduction with holes as the predominant charge carriers. The semiconductivity is also supported by the almost zero electronic specific-heat coefficient γ. The mechanism of thermal conduction was analyzed by abstracting electronic and lattice thermal conductivities through thermal transport measurement and meanwhile the thermoelectric properties were characterized. The differences in band structures and formation energy between the two variants were studied by ab-initio calculations, which indicate that the H-phase is a semiconductor and the C-phase is a semimetal with low density of states, and the hexagonal modification is comparatively stable. The cubic polytype of Cu6GeWSe8 expands the Cu-Ge-W-Se system. A stereo phase diagram making reviews on the rich materials, and multiple crystallographic and electronic states in this system was established, which would be helpful to guide for seeking new materials and to probe the interplay between polymorphism and property in chalcogenide family. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Band structures; Phase diagram; Phase transition; Polymorphism; Semiconductor-like","Copper compounds; Energy gap; Germanium compounds; Polymorphism; Semiconducting selenium compounds; Specific heat; Temperature; Thermal conductivity; A: semiconductors; Cubic modifications; Double layers; Face-centred cubic; Intermediate bands; Lows-temperatures; Noncentrosymmetric space groups; Polytypes; Semiconductor-like; Tetrahedra; Phase diagrams","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11774402, 12074414); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDB25000000); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFA0704200, 2021YFA1401800)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 11774402 and 12074414 ), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant Nos. 2018YFA0704200 and 2021YFA1401800 ), and the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDB25000000 ).","M.

In this research, we explored the potential of a new composite hydrogels series of sodium alginate (Alg) filled with cross-linked chitosan to use as hydrogel wound dressings. Cross-linked chitosan (CSPN) was synthesized by Schiff-base reaction with aldehydated cyclophosphazene, and its Cu(II) complex was manufactured and identified. Then, their powder suspension and Alg were transformed into hydrogel via ion-crosslinking with Ca2+. The hydrogel constituents were investigated by using FTIR, XRD, rheological techniques, and thermal analysis including TGA (DTG) and DSC. Moreover, structure optimization calculations were performed with the Material Studio 2017 program based on DFT-D per Dmol3 module. Examination of Alg's interactions with CSPN and CSPN-Cu using this module demonstrated that Alg molecules can be well adsorbed to the particle's surface. By changing the dosage of CSPN and CSPN-Cu, the number and size of pores, swelling rate, degradation behavior, protein absorption rate, cytotoxicity and blood compatibility were changed significantly. Subsequently, we employed erythromycin as a model drug to assess the entrapment efficiency, loading capacity, and drug release rate. FITC staining was selected to verify the hydrogels' intracellular uptake. Assuring the cytocompatibility of Alg-based hydrogels was approved by assessing the survival rate of fibroblast cells using MTT assay. However, the presence of Cu(II) in the developed hydrogels caused a significant antibacterial effect, which was comparable to the antibiotic-containing hydrogels. Our findings predict these porous, biodegradable, and mechanically stable hydrogels potentially have a promising future in the wound healing as antibiotic-free antibacterial dressings. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Cyclophosphazene; Hydrogel wound dressings; Ion-crosslinking","Antibiotics; Biopolymers; Cell culture; Chitosan; Copper compounds; Drug delivery; Hydrogels; Particle size analysis; Sodium alginate; Structural optimization; Thermoanalysis; Antibacterials; Composite hydrogels; Cross linked chitosan; Cyclophosphazene; Cytocompatibility; Hydrogel wound dressing; Hydrogels dressings; Ion-crosslinking; Skin lesion; Wound dressings; Crosslinking","Health Technology Institute; Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, KUMS; Tarbiat Modares University, TMU","Funding text 1: The present study was supported by Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.

In this study, we provide the atomic-level description on the formation of Cu clusters on the Cu(111) surface by performing set of molecular dynamics simulations driven by machine-learning force-field. The simulations at 450 K-550 K show clusters are formed within a hundred of ns when the Cu surface is exposed with CO. On the other hand, no cluster is formed within the same time interval on the clean Cu surface even at 550 K, which signifies the importance of CO exposure to the surface transformation. The effect of temperature to the formation of clusters is also investigated. The CO-decorated Cu clusters ranging from dimer to hexamer are detected within a hundred of ns at 450 K. Lowering the temperature to 350 K does not result in the formation of clusters within a hundred ns due to the scarce detachments of adatom, while raising the temperature to 550 K results in the formation of more clusters, ranging from dimer to heptamer, but with shorter lifetimes. The clusters can be formed directly through instantaneous detachment of a group of step-atoms, or indirectly by aggregation of wandering Cu monomers and smaller clusters on the surface terrace. The preference to the indirect mechanism is indicated by the higher frequency of its occurrence. Set of nudged elastic band calculations has been performed to confirm the promotion of CO adsorptions to the detachment of Cu step-atoms by lowering the detachment barrier. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","carbon monoxide; Cu surface; machine learning; molecular dynamics; surface reconstruction","Atoms; Carbon monoxide; Copper; Dimers; Machine learning; Atomic levels; Cu surfaces; Dynamics simulation; Effects of temperature; Forcefields; Machine-learning; Mechanical aspects; Surface transformations; Surfaces reconstruction; Time interval; Molecular dynamics","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JPJS CCB20210004); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (JP20H02569, JP20H05883); Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (JPMJSC21E4); Osaka University, OU","H H H would like to thank the scholarship aid in Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University provided by MEXT (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology).

In the present work, we developed Cerium dioxide (CeO2) and nickel selenide (Ni0.85Se) nanoparticles integrated into three-dimensional N-doped carbon nanosheets to be used as efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for MOR and UOR. By optimizing the selenization temperature, the CeO2-modified Ni0.85Se obtained at selenization temperature of 550 °C (CeO2-Ni0.85Se-550-NC) has the best MOR and UOR electrochemical performance. The CeO2-Ni0.85Se-550-NC potential only requires 1.309 V (MOR) and 1.294 V (UOR) to reach 10 mA cm−2, respectively. The DFT study reveals that CeO2-Ni0.85Se-550-NC has the best reaction path with the synergistic effect between CeO2 and Ni0.85Se. The outstanding catalytic performance of CeO2-Ni0.85Se-550-NC may be due to the cointeraction between CeO2 and Ni0.85Se, allowing more defects that function as catalytic sites while promoting fast electron transfer in the N-doped carbon substrate. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","CeO<sub>2</sub>; Methanol electro-oxidation; Nickel selenide; Urea electro-oxidation","Carbon; Cerium oxide; Design for testability; Doping (additives); Electrocatalysts; Metabolism; Methanol; Nanosheets; Nickel compounds; Selenium compounds; Urea; Water pollution; carbon; cerium oxide; methanol; nanosheet; nickel; selenide; urea; Carbon nanosheets; Doped carbons; Electrooxidations; Low-costs; Methanol electrooxidation; Methanol oxidation reactions; N-doped; Oxidation reactions; Selenization temperatures; Urea electro-oxidation; adsorption; Article; calcination temperature; catalysis; catalyst; chemical reaction kinetics; chemical vapor deposition; chronoamperometry; comparative study; controlled study; current density; density functional theory; desorption; doping; electron diffraction; fast electron radiation; freeze drying; isotherm; morphology; oxidation; oxidation reduction reaction; performance; pyrolysis; surface area; synergistic effect; synthesis; temperature; valence (chemistry); water pollution; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; Electrooxidation","Fundamental Research Funds for the Inner Mongolia Normal University, (2022JBBJ011); Inner Mongolia Normal University; Key Laboratory of Infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian System; Research Foundation for Advanced Talents of Inner Mongolia Normal University, (2018YJRC001, 2018YJRC012); Science and Technology Program of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, (2020PT0003); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (22062019); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (2023KFYB01)","We would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 22062019), the Key Laboratory of Infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian System and Its Algorithm Application (Inner Mongolia Normal University), Ministry of Education (2023KFYB01), Science and Technology Program of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China (2020PT0003), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Inner Mongolia Normal University (2022JBBJ011), and the Research Foundation for Advanced Talents of Inner Mongolia Normal University (No. 2018YJRC001 and 2018YJRC012) for financial support.

Despite its favorable gap, there is insufficient research on the double perovskite Cs2NaTlBr6, and its photoelectric properties are still unclear. This work investigated the electronic band structure and optical absorption spectrum of Cs2NaTlBr6 based on the excitonic effect using density functional theory, GW, and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) correction. GW method, by considering the electron-hole interaction, combined with the BSE derived from two-particle Green's function, is an accurate approach to studying the optical properties and excitonic effects. The results show that BSE correction significantly affects the optical absorption spectrum. It turns out that there is a high bounded dark exciton before the first bright one. The first bright excitons are strongly localized and have a strong binding energy. This high binding energy can cause high luminescence in light-emitting devices. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH","BSE correction; Density functional theory; Double Perovskite; First principle; GW approximation; Optical absorption","Absorption spectra; Absorption spectroscopy; Binding energy; Excitons; III-V semiconductors; Light absorption; Light emission; Optical properties; Perovskite; Bethe-Salpeter equation; Bethe-salpeter equation correction; Density-functional-theory; Double perovskites; Excitonic effect; First principles; GW approximation; Optical absorption spectrum; Organic/inorganic; Photoelectric property; Density functional theory","","","A.

The Bi/Se30S30Sb40 heterostructure film was annealed at 100,150,200 and 250 °C. The Bi2Se3 and Sb2Se3 phase formation was confirmed from the X-ray diffraction as well as from the Raman study. The morphology has been studied by the field emission scanning electron microscopy images with increased particle size upon annealing. The uniformity and homogeneity of the film were noticed from the energy dispersive X-ray analysis elemental mapping. The bandgap decreased from 1.461 eV (as-prepared Bi/Se30S30Sb40) to 1.258 eV (250 °C annealed) with an increment in static refractive index from 2.864 to 3.114 which was noticed from the optical study. The linear optical parameters were tuned with annealing conditions and such changes were understood from the concept of density of states and defects in the film. The increase in dielectric loss factor and decrease in quality factor with annealing is accompanied by the increase in both electronic and optical conductivity. The plasma frequency decreased and optical electronegativity reduced from 1.728 (as-prepared Bi/Se30S30Sb40) to 1.692 (250 °C annealed) with annealing. The value of 3rd-order nonlinear susceptibility and non-linear refractive index gets almost doubled (i.e. 1.838 × 10−11 to 3.913 × 10−11 esu and 2.419 × 10−10 to 4.735 × 10−10 esu respectively) with annealing with an increase in the nonlinear absorption coefficient. The hydrophilic nature of the films with annealing was observed from the surface wettability study. The computational study by density functional theory provided the necessary idea for structural and physical parameters of the films. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Annealing; Bi/Se<sub>30</sub>S<sub>30</sub>Sb<sub>40</sub> film; DFT calculation; Dielectric constants; Hydrophilic; Nonlinear susceptibility; Optical properties","Antimony compounds; Bismuth compounds; Chemical bonds; Density functional theory; Dielectric losses; Electronegativity; Energy dispersive X ray analysis; Film preparation; Hydrophilicity; Morphology; Nonlinear optics; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Refractive index; Scanning electron microscopy; Sulfur compounds; X ray diffraction analysis; Annealing; Bi/se30S30sb40 film; DFT calculation; Dielectric parameters; Experimental approaches; Hydrophilics; Nonlinear susceptibilities; Optical parameter; Phase Change; Thermal-annealing; Selenium compounds","University Grants Commission, UGC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The author B.

This demonstrates the potential for controlling and tuning the electronic properties of SnAs through surface functionalization. Moreover, depending on the specific stacking patterns in the SnAs/SnAsCl heterostructure, we observe the formation of either Ohmic contact or Schottky contact. Particularly noteworthy is the presence of ultra-low Schottky barriers, measured at 0.03 eV, charge transport efficiency and improving device performance. The SnAs/SnAsCl heterostructure exhibits small tunneling probability, indicating a relatively low electron transparency.

Electron–phonon coupling calculations indicated that the Tc values of P42/mmc-, I41/amd-, and P6/mmm-LiB2 structures were approximately 20.1 K, 12.6 K, and 31.4 K at ambient pressure, respectively. The present results may serve as a reference in the experimental and theoretical study of LiB2 compounds. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Crystal structure; Electronic band structure; Electron–phonon interaction; Superconductor","","Ph.D Foundation of Hebei University of Water Resources and Electric Engineering, (SYBJ2105); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51072174, 51772263)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51772263 and 51072174 ) and the Ph.D Foundation of Hebei University of Water Resources and Electric Engineering (No. SYBJ2105 ).","L.

In the present research, sulfide-modified nanoscale zero-valent iron (S-nZVI) was fabricated and used as activator of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for TC degradation. Sulfidation could improve the hydrophobicity of nZVI and its reactivity for TC degradation by up to 260 %. The reaction rate constant of the S-nZVI/H2O2 system was 16 times faster than that of the S-nZVI system. The quenching experiments results proved that •OH was the predominant radical involved in TC degradation. •OH played a significant role in ferryl ion (Fe(IV)) formation under acid conditions, while TC plays crucial roles under neutral pH condition in Fe(IV) formation by accelerating Fe(III) oxidation into Fe(IV). The possible degradation pathways were analyzed, and the toxicity analysis confirmed that the S-nZVI/H2O2 system is an effective method for degrading, and thus reducing the toxicity of TC. Therefore, this study suggests the possibility of an S-nZVI/H2O2 system for the efficient degradation of TC. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Degradation; Fenton; Ferryl ion (Fe(IV)); Hydroxyl radical; Sulfidation","Iron compounds; Nanotechnology; Rate constants; Sulfur compounds; Bacterial resistance; Fenton; Ferryl ion; Ferryl ion (fe(IV)); Hydroxyl radicals; Nano-scale zero valent irons; Nanoscale zero-valent iron; Removal mechanism; Removal performance; Sulfidation; Toxicity","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (22276216)","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 22276216 ).

The dynamics of the entropic uncertainty and entanglement of formation are significantly altered by the atom-photon-atom interaction parameters. By increasing the initial mean photon number, the QM entropic uncertainty and the atomic entanglement can be improved. Bob's capacity to limit his uncertainty regarding Alice's measurement results depends on the initial even coherent state, the atom–photon couplings, and the atomic motion parameter. The atomic location couplings produce QM entropic uncertainty and entanglement with regular oscillatory behavior.

One such material of interest is the chalcogenide mercury sulfide (HgS), also known as cinnabar. Cinnabar (α-HgS) and its synthetic counterpart (vermilion) have been used as bright red pigments since antiquity and are important sulfide materials in the field of art conservation. However, it has been known since Roman times that these pigments can darken when exposed to light. It has been hypothesized that Cl2 and other chlorine-containing materials are involved in the photodegradation of cinnabar surfaces. Here we use first-principles density functional theory (DFT) to probe the adsorption reactivity of Cl-containing adsorbates on HgS surfaces, as DFT yields information at the atomistic level and can link changes in surface structure to changes in electronic states. Specifically, we model single adsorbates interacting with corrugated and flat HgS surfaces to probe the initial step in the photodegradation mechanism. This allows us to not only assess the strength of adsorption and any corresponding adsorbate dissociations, but also link these adsorption and dissociation events to key changes in the electronic band structure that may act as spectroscopic identifiers in the degradation pathway of chalcogenide semiconductors that contain photoreactive metals. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; Chlorine; Cinnabar; Density functional theory (DFT); Mercury sulfide; Vermilion","Adsorption; Chalcogenides; Chlorine; Chlorine compounds; Dissociation; Mercury compounds; Sulfur compounds; Surface structure; Art conservation; Cinnabar; Density functional theory; Density-functional-theory; First-principle computations; Photo degradation; Red pigments; Semi-conductor surfaces; Surface adsorption; Vermilion; Density functional theory","Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment; XSEDE, (TG-CHE190075); National Science Foundation, NSF, (ACI-1548562); Andrew W.

Integration of semiconductor nanostructures with 2D MXene can be a promising approach for high-performance photodetection. Herein, we adopted an in-situ hydrothermal approach for in-situ anchoring of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets on 1D Bi2S3 nanorods and fabricated a Bi2S3/Ti3C2Tx (1D/2D) Schottky junction broadband photodetector (PD) with outstanding performance. The mechanism behind the excellent performance and formation of the local Schottky junction was investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and validated through various microscopic and spectroscopic tools. In particular, the DFT analysis reveals that the partial density of states of Bi2S3 is altered with additional electronic states in the band-gap region due to attachment of Ti3C2O2, which helps in the efficient charge transport and charge separation across the local junctions. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy elucidates the nature of band alignment and interfacial charge transfer across the Bi2S3/Ti3C2Tx MXene junction locally. The low-cost PD exhibits an excellent broadband responsivity spanning from ultraviolet to near-infrared region (300–1550 nm) with a peak responsivity of 36.7 A/W and 26.2 A/W at 300 nm and 780 nm, respectively. Further, the device exhibited an external quantum efficiency of ∼3.9 × 103 %, and a fast response of ∼300 μs under 3 V bias, which are remarkable. Finally, the fabricated PD demonstrates a very high long-term storage stability in ambient condition.

But the issue of exponential computational complexity limits its real-time application. Since quantum computers with its natural parallel computing capability can theoretically achieve speedup, an HHL-based algorithm for implementing DST operations on quantum circuits has been proposed. However, the algorithm is impossible to be implemented with high accuracy due to the limited performance of quantum computers in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In response to that, we utilize an up-to-date scheme Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) to conduct DST operations by solving the linear system. Besides, VQLS further reveals the structural consistency of DST with quantum computation, which enables faster circuit configuration and computation. In this paper, we first realize the transformation in belief functions by VQLS and then extends it to a methods of implementing combination rules. Simulated under a realistic classification task, the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed VQLS-based method are verified. The new VQLS-based method proposed is able to achieve combination rules at a lower error level with fewer quantum resources, which is more suitable for the NISQ era. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Belief matrices; Dempster–Shafer Theory; Information fusion; Variational Quantum Algorithm; Variational Quantum Linear Solver","Decision making; Decision theory; Linear systems; Quantum computers; Uncertainty analysis; Belief matrix; Combination rules; Dempster-Shafer theory; Linear solver; matrix; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Uncertain informations; Variational quantum algorithm; Variational quantum linear solv; Information fusion","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62373078)","The work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62373078 ).","Y.

The heating during the dehydrogenation process, on the other hand, can easily induce H2 to penetrate the surrounding environment, resulting in hydrogen embrittlement and threatening structural safety. The system's temperature regulation is very critical. The electronic thermal conductivity of ZrCo was computed using the BoltzTraP2 program and the constant relaxation time approximation based on density functional theory (DFT). The phonon thermal conductivity is calculated by lattice dynamics using the finite displacement supercell method. Between 300 K and 800 K, the thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity of ZrCo alloy were effectively predicted for the first time. The effects of Ti and V doping on ZrCo alloy thermal conductivity were investigated. The results show that when temperature rises, phonon-electron and phonon-phonon scattering will be enhanced. Resistance and thermal resistance will also rise, while conductivity and thermal conductivity would decrease. The doping of Ti and V elements will reduce the electronic thermal conductivity of the system. Different concentrations of doping bring different degrees of defects, affecting the average electron-phonon free path, and thereby reducing thermal conductivity. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Doping; Electrical conductivity; First-principles; Hydrogen storage alloys; Thermal conductivity","Binary alloys; Cobalt alloys; Crystal lattices; Dehydrogenation; Density functional theory; Experimental reactors; Hydrogen storage alloys; Phonons; Spark plasma sintering; Thermal conductivity; Titanium; Zircaloy; Dehydrogenation kinetics; Doping effects; Electrical conductivity; Electronic thermal conductivity; First principles; First-principle study; Hydrogen isotope; International thermonuclear experimental reactor; Structural safety; Surrounding environment; Hydrogen storage","Applied Basic Research Program of Sichuan Province, (2020YJ0257); National Safety Academic Fund, NSAF, (U2130208)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of NSAF “Surface reconstruction and activity regulation of hydrogen storage materials” under Grant No. U2130208 , and that of the Sichuan Province Application of Basic Research Program “Study on Dynamic Characteristics and Optimization of Heat and Mass Transfer Process in Metal Hydrogen Storage Bed” under Grant No. 2020YJ0257 .","X.

To analyze the effect of strain/stress on the atomic magnetism of Ni-based materials strain-induced changes of magnetic properties of FCC-Ni 2 × 2 × 2 supercell and its doped systems with Cu and Nb atoms are studied by the first principal density functional theory. Firstly, addition of Cu or Nb promote the expansion of nickel lattice, and Nb makes this effect more significant. Cu atoms enhance the magnetic moment of Ni atoms, while Nb atoms play an inhibitory role. Secondly, for uniaxial strain, the magnetic moments of atoms in the doping-free systems show a nearly monotonic increasing trend from compression to tension, while the doped systems show a trend of first increases and then decreases. Furthermore, for shear loading, the atomic magnetic moment decreases with increases of the shear strain. Further investigation shows that Ni atoms at different distances exhibit completely different magnetic behavior due to the influence of loadings and doping atoms. This study would be an important supplement to the physical mechanism of multi-field coupling in magnetic non-destructive testing. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Magnetic moment; Magnetic non-destructive testing; Ni doping systems; Strain effect; Testing mechanism","Atoms; Density functional theory; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Magnetic properties; Nickel; Nondestructive examination; Shear strain; Cu atoms; Doped systems; Doping system; Magnetic non-destructive testing; Nb atoms; Ni atoms; Ni doping system; Ni-doping; Strain effect; Testing mechanism; Magnetic moments","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11802225); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, (2021JQ-494)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, China [Grant No. 11802225 ] and Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, China [Grant Nos. 2021JQ-494 ].

However, it is not easy to efficiently solve the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) from ballistic to diffusive limit. In order to accelerate convergence, an implicit synthetic iterative scheme is developed for the stationary phonon BTE, in which a macroscopic moment equation is invoked and solved iteratively coupled with the typical source iteration of the kinetic equation. Different from previous numerical interpolation, the phonon BTE is solved again at the cell interface along the group velocity direction within a certain length when reconstructing the interfacial phonon distribution function. Fourier stability analysis shows that the present method could converge faster than the source iteration method in the (near) diffusive regime. Numerical results prove that the present scheme can capture the ballistic-diffusive effects correctly and efficiently. The present acceleration framework could be a powerful tool for simulating practical thermal engineering problems in the future. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Boltzmann transport equation; Discrete ordinate method; Micro/nano scale heat conduction; Phonon transport; Synthetic iterative acceleration scheme","Boltzmann equation; Distribution functions; Energy harvesting; Heat conduction; Integral equations; Iterative methods; Phonons; Thermal Engineering; Acceleration strategies; Boltzmann's transport equations; Discrete ordinates method; Iteration method; Mesoscopics; Micro-nano scale; Micro/nano scale heat conduction; Nano scale heat conduction; Phonon transport; Synthetic iterative acceleration scheme; Ballistics","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2021-02957); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M701565); Southern University of Science and Technology, SUSTech","S.H. acknowledges support from the NSERC Discovery Grants Program under Grant No. RGPIN-2021-02957 .

Defect formation energy calculations showed an energy advantage for co-doped systems under Ti-poor and O-rich conditions. The La-V, La-Cr, La-Mn, La-Fe, and La-Ni co-doped systems showed magnetic properties with corresponding total magnetization of 0.08 µB, 2.97 µB, 3.30 µB, 1.00 µB and 1.00 µB, respectively. The La-X (X = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, or Cu) co-doped system exhibits photoabsorption activity in the visible region as compared to the pure SrTiO3. The La-X (X = Cr, Fe, Ni, or Cu) co-doped SrTiO3 exhibits a long carrier lifetime, especially the La-Fe co-doped system with a high effective mass ratio of holes to electrons of 5.79. However, the redox potential of the water decomposition reaction of the La-Cu co-doped system is too large, making it unsuitable for water splitting. In summary, the La-X (X = Cr, Fe, or Ni) co-doped systems exhibited intermediate states in the band structure and density of states, which better meet the specific requirements for photocatalysis compared to systems without intermediate states, showing superior photocatalytic potential. The band edge alignment of the three co-doped systems with water redox potentials demonstrated good matching.

MXene is one of the 2D materials that has recently drawn much interest due to its intriguing catalytic properties. In this work, employing density functional theory we have systematically studied and compared the HER activity of Ti2CO2 MXene with adsorbed Cu3 and Cu5 clusters on top. Our findings suggest that the Ti2CO2 MXene with adsorbed Cu3 cluster exhibits significant enhancement in catalytic activity towards HER. The Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH∗) is found to be −0.08 eV, which is close to the ideal value, suggesting comparable catalytic activity to platinum. In contrast, the Ti2CO2-Cu5 catalyst exhibits a higher Gibbs free energy value of 0.105 eV for HER. The stability of the structures was evaluated by assessing the cohesive and binding energies, supported by Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations. A thorough analysis of the electronic structure and bonding nature of the catalysts are presented. These analyses suggest that the boost in catalytic activity could be ascribed to the accumulated charge at the centre of the Cu3 cluster. Based on our comparison, the Ti2CO2-Cu3 catalyst emerges as a more suitable candidate for the HER process, highlighting its potential as a cost-effective and efficient HER catalyst. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","2D-materials; Density functional theory; Hydrogen evolution reaction; MXene","Binding energy; Catalyst activity; Chemical bonds; Cost effectiveness; Electronic structure; Free energy; Gas adsorption; Gibbs free energy; Molecular dynamics; Reaction kinetics; Ternary alloys; Titanium compounds; 2d-material; Catalytic properties; Cost effective; Density-functional-theory; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen evolution reaction activities; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Mxene; Renewable energies; ]+ catalyst; Density functional theory","DST-India, (IFA-18 PH217); National PARAM Supercomputing Facility; Param Sanganak; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India, CSIR; Ministry of Electronics and Information technology, Meity","Funding text 1: We acknowledge the National Supercomputing Mission (NSM), India for providing computing resources of ‘PARAM Siddhi-AI’ under the National PARAM Supercomputing Facility (NPSF), India , C-DAC, Pune, India , and supported by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), India and Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India .

For deposition rate studies, five different rates (0.01 ML/s, 0.1 ML/s, 1.0 ML/s, 10.0 ML/s, and 100 ML/s) were considered at 550 K for Cr and W respectively. The effect of temperature on roughness was also studied employing various temperatures from 300 K to 1100 K for both metals and under the two different evolution models. The results show that the unrestricted diffusion model exhibits higher roughness compared to the restricted model for both metals. The restricted model shows a stable region of roughness, whereas the unrestricted model shows a continuous increase in roughness throughout the simulation. Furthermore, layer density analysis revealed that temperature affects the filling of lower monolayers. Finally, dynamic exponents β and α for each studied model were calculated and discussed. The results highlight the influence of diffusion models, deposition rate and temperature on surface, roughness, and layer density. © 2023","DFT; KMC; Metal Surfaces; Surface Diffusion; Surface Growth","Density functional theory; Deposition rates; Diffusion; Monte Carlo methods; Density-functional-theory; Diffusion model; Growth behavior; Kinetic Monte Carlo; Kinetic monte carlo simulation; Metal surfaces; Restricted modelling; Surface growth; Three models; [A] Growth models; Surface roughness","Conicet postdoctoral scholarship program; Manizales Campus, (2021000100388); Mescyt from the Dominican Republic; Fondo Nacional de Innovación y Desarrollo Científico–Tecnológico, FONDOCYT, (2020-2021-1A2-112); Universidad Nacional de Colombia, UNAL; Ministrstvo za visoko šolstvo, znanost in tehnologijo; Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, UTP, (3-22-3)","The authors would like to acknowledge the funding support from Minciencias under the “Bicentennial Doctoral Excellence Scholarship Program of Colombia-2019”, and from Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira (Grant number: 3-22-3).

The platform, its architecture and capabilities, and useful software paradigms and patterns which are uncommon in physics codes are presented here. Finally, DFT+G and DFT+DMFT calculations of NiO are presented to demonstrate how combining multiple quantum embedding methods empowers analysis. Program summary: Program Title: Portobello CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/5p4nggbktd.1 Developer's repository link: https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~adler/portobello.html Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Python, Fortran, C++, CUDA Nature of problem: Abstracting quantum embedding methods and integrating them with legacy (Fortran) code in order to develop a flexible and maintainable modern platform for strongly correlated electron calculation is difficult, due to the structure of legacy code, the barriers between modern programming languages and Fortran, and the need for high-level abstractions which are best supported with modern languages and tools. Solution method: A metadata repository of C++ header files (schema) is established which defines the complex data structures upon which the abstractions in Portobello are built. An automatic code-generator translates this schemas into Fortran and Python structures which may be stored or loaded from file or memory seamlessly and in either language. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: DFT+G and DFT+DMFT are implemented seamlessly to facilitate use, comparison, and extension. Symmetry analysis, including symmetry adapted bases, is available for projection. Multiple (inequivalent) impurities and sub-shell calculations (e.g., one can project onto just the eg orbitals of a correlated d-shell) are supported.

The RTe 3 (R = rare-earth elements) family of materials provides a fertile ground to study the dynamics of CDW in van der Waals layered materials, and the presence of magnetism in these materials allows to explore the interplay among CDW and long range magnetic ordering. Here, we have carried out a high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study of a CDW material Gd Te 3 , which is antiferromagnetic below ∼12K , along with thermodynamic, electrical transport, magnetic, and Raman measurements. Our ARPES data show a two-fold symmetric Fermi surface with both gapped and ungapped regions indicative of the partial nesting. The gap is momentum dependent, maximum along Γ ¯ - Z ¯ and gradually decreases going towards Γ ¯ - X ¯ .

In particular, we examine the 9-7-9 AGNR heterostructures where the TSs are well-isolated from the conduction and valence subbands. This isolation effectively mitigates thermal noise of subbands arising from temperature fluctuations during charge transport. Moreover, when the TSs exhibit an orbital off-set, intriguing electron heat rectification phenomena are observed, primarily attributed to inter-TS electron Coulomb interactions. To enhance the heat rectification ratio (η Q), we manipulate the coupling strengths between the heat sources and the TSs by introducing asymmetrical lengths in the 9-AGNRs. This approach offers control over the rectification properties, enabling significant enhancements. Additionally, we introduce vacancies strategically positioned between the heat sources and the TSs to suppress phonon heat current. This arrangement effectively reduces the overall phonon heat current, while leaving the TSs unaffected. Our findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of electron heat current in AGNR heterostructures, highlighting the role of topological states, inter-TS electron Coulomb interactions, and the impact of structural modifications such as asymmetrical lengths and vacancy positioning.

We consider a broadly applicable, quantitative metric for evaluating and optimizing trajectories in this context. This methodology enables rigorous analysis of the failure modes of various common trajectory choices in crystalline materials. Although randomly selecting trajectories is common practice in stopping power calculations in solids, we show that nearly 30% of random trajectories in an FCC aluminum crystal will not representatively sample the material over the time and length scales feasibly simulated with TDDFT, and unrepresentative choices incur errors of up to 60%. We also show that finite-size effects depend on ion trajectory via “ouroboros” effects beyond the prevailing plasmon-based interpretation, and we propose a cost-reducing scheme to obtain converged results even when expensive core-electron contributions preclude large supercells. This work helps to mitigate poorly controlled approximations in first-principles stopping power calculations, allowing 1–2 order of magnitude cost reductions for obtaining representatively averaged and converged results. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Computation theory; Cost reduction; Density functional theory; Random errors; Electronic stopping power; Finite size effect; First principles; Ion trajectories; Power calculation; Quantitative metric; Real- time; Rigorous analysis; Stopping power; Time dependent density functional theory; Trajectories","Alexandra Olmstead; Susan Atlas; US Department of Energy Science Campaign; United States Government; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Fusion Energy Sciences, FES, (FWP-14-017426); Sandia National Laboratories, SNL; Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD, (218456)","Funding text 1: We thank André Schleife, Cheng-Wei Lee, Susan Atlas, Alexandra Olmstead, and Alexander White for helpful technical discussions.

The results obtained show that the band gap of pure graphene may be effectively opened and converted into a direct bandgap semiconductor material by replacing the C atom with Si/Ge atoms. Phonon dispersion provides a representation of the dynamical stability of all three structures. Graphene's thermal conductivity is also decreased when heteroatoms are added.

This model is mapped onto a Kitaev-Creutz type model, providing a useful framework to understand the topology through a nontrivial winding number and the geometry introduced by the Fubini-Study (FS) metric. This metric allows us to distinguish between pure states of systems with the same topology and thus provides a suitable tool for obtaining the fingerprint of flat bands. Moreover, it provides an appealing geometrical picture for describing flat bands as it can be associated with a local conformal transformation over circles in a complex plane. In addition, the presented model allows us to relate the topology with the formation of compact localized states and pseudo-Bogoliubov modes. Also, the properties of the squared Hamiltonian are investigated in order to provide a better understanding of the localization properties and the spectrum. The presented model is equivalent to two coupled SSH chains under a change of basis. © 2023 The Author(s).

We use a normalization procedure to encode the SPH operators and domain discretization in a quantum register. We then perform the SPH summation via an inner product of quantum registers. Using a one-dimensional function, we test the approach in a classical sense for the kernel sum and first and second derivatives of a one-dimensional function, using both the Gaussian and Wendland kernel functions, and compare various register sizes against analytical results. Error convergence is exponentially fast in the number of qubits. We extend the method to solve the one-dimensional advection and diffusion partial differential equations, which are commonly encountered in fluids simulations.

In this manuscript we show that introducing small lanthanum (La3+) content can tune magnetic, electronic and cytotoxic properties of the CoFe2−xLaxO4 system (x ≤ 0.1). The mechanisms of the tuning are comprehensively studied by theoretical electronic structure calculations; spectroscopic methods (FTIR, Mössbauer, XAS); structural and microstructural research; magnetometry; and cytotoxic viabilities of normal and cancer cells. It was found that the mechanism originate mainly from the complex exchange interaction of the 3d states of cations with 2p states of oxygen caused by mixing of the metals over the tetragonal and octahedral positions. For synthesized CoFe2−xLaxO4 nanoparticles (NPs) in vitro studies of toxicity on the tested cell lines (human Hs27 fibroblasts, A375 melanoma, Nthy-ori 3-1 thyrocytes, and FTC-133 thyroid cancer cells) revealed that CoFe2−xLaxO4 NPs have high impact on cancer cells, while their toxicity towards normal cells is significantly lower.

In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing era, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is expected as an effective method to solve quantum chemistry problems which has potential quantum advantage. Classically simulating quantum algorithms plays a critical role in algorithmic development and the validation of noisy quantum devices before large-scale, fully fault-tolerant quantum computers are developed. However, most existing simulators are based on the state vector or density matrix representation of the quantum state which is faced with the memory bottleneck due to the exponential growth of memory requirement as the number of qubits increases. In this work, we present a VQE simulator based on the matrix product states (MPS) method from quantum many-body physics, and a detailed study of our MPS-VQE simulator in quantum chemistry applications. The memory requirement of MPS-VQE grows only polynomially and we demonstrate that accurate results can be obtained despite the truncation of the smallest singular values during the algorithm. A distributed parallelization scheme is also presented for massively parallel computer systems, and different implementations of the parallelization scheme based on the Julia language are benchmarked which demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our method.

The focus is laid on the evaluation and characterization of the effect of quantum confinement on the amplifier behavior. The high computational burden related to the time-resolved analysis of such three-dimensional simulations is dealt with by applying a mode-space approach onto a Quantum Liouville-type Equation. It is shown that the diagonal coupling terms related to the mode-space approach should be taken into consideration for the analysis of FinFETs. An increase in gain compression and higher order harmonic distortion is observed, when the fin height is decreased and, therefore, stronger quantum confinement occurs. The 1 dB compression point is shown to decrease by as much as 8 dB when reducing the fin height from 7 to 3 nm. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Computational nanotechnology; FinFET; Gain compression; Mode space; Quantum Liouville; Quantum transport","Fins (heat exchange); Nanotechnology; Quantum chemistry; Quantum confinement; Computational nanotechnology; Fin height; FinFETs; Gain compression; Liouville; Mode space approaches; Mode spaces; Nano scale; Quantum liouville; Quantum transport; FinFET","German Research Funding Association Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (SCHU 1016/8)","This work was supported by the German Research Funding Association Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), Germany under Grant SCHU 1016/8 .

Here, by using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically disclose physical properties of chlorinated phosphorene having the stoichiometry of PmCln. By analyzing the adsorption energy, charge density, migration energy barrier, structural, vibrational, and electronic properties of chlorinated phosphorene, we found that (I) the Cl–P bonds are strong with binding energy Eb = -1.61 eV, decreases with increasing n. (II) Cl atoms on phosphorene have anionic feature, (III) the migration path of Cl on phosphorene is anisotropic with an energy barrier of 0.38 eV, (IV) the phonon band dispersion reveal that chlorinated phosphorenes are stable when r≤ 0.25 where r=m/n, (V) chlorinated phosphorenes is found to be a photonic crystal in the frequency range of 280 cm−1 to 325 cm−1, (VI) electronic band structure of chlorinated phosphorenes exhibits quasi-flat bands emerging around the Fermi level with widths in the range of 22 meV to 580 meV, and (VII) Cl adsorption causes a semiconducting to metallic/semi-metallic transition which makes it suitable for application as an electroactive material. To elucidate this application, we investigated the change in binding energy (Eb), specific capacity, and open-circuit voltage as a function of the density of adsorbed Cl. The theoretical storage capacity of the chlorinated phosphorene is found to be 168.19 mA h g−1 with a large average voltage (∼2.08 V) which is ideal number as a cathode in chloride-ion batteries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Chloride-ion battery; Chlorinated phosphorene; Migration path; Photonic crystal; Quasi-flat band","Binding energy; Chlorine; Chlorine compounds; Crystal atomic structure; Crystal impurities; Density functional theory; Energy barriers; Energy gap; Open circuit voltage; Adsorption energies; Chloride ions; Chloride-ion battery; Chlorinated phosphorene; Density-functional theory calculations; Energy applications; Flat band; Ion batteries; Migration path; Quasi-flat band; Electronic properties","Iran National Science Foundation, INSF; Razi University; Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK, (122F140)","N.

The number of interatomic potentials available is growing very rapidly, and there is a great need to develop a unified approach to evaluate their accuracy, and one such approach is proposed in this work. The theoretical basis of the approach is the use of exact solutions of the equations of motion for the considered lattice. Such solutions, called delocalized nonlinear vibrational modes (DNVMs), are determined solely on the basis of lattice symmetry and for this reason they exist for any interatomic potential and for arbitrarily large amplitudes. The DNVM properties can be calculated using an ab initio approach to obtain data to verify the accuracy of the MD potentials. Analysis of DNVMs is a fundamentally new approach to checking the quality of interatomic potentials, which analyzes not the configurations of atoms, but the trajectories of their motion. Here, this approach is applied to bcc tungsten to evaluate the quality of nine commonly used interatomic potentials. The proposed method can be used as an effective testing tool to supplement existing methods for testing interatomic potentials. © 2023","Crystal lattice; Delocalized nonlinear vibrational mode; Exact solution; Interatomic potential; Molecular dynamics; Nonlinear dynamics; Tungsten","Crystal lattices; Equations of motion; Quality control; Tungsten; Delocalized nonlinear vibrational mode; Exact solution; Interatomic potential; Laser process; Metallic material; Molecular dynamic models; Severe plastic deformations; Structural transformation; Unified approach; Vibrational modes; Molecular dynamics","UUST, (075-03-2023-119, NSh-4320.2022.1.2); Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka; Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (21-12-00229); Council on grants of the President of the Russian Federation","S.A.S. and S.V.D. acknowledge the support of the Russian Science Foundation , Grant No. 21-12-00229 (Conceptualization and methodology, manuscript writing).

However, the known algorithms are either probabilistic (repeat until success) with unpractically small success probabilities or coherent (quantum amplitude amplification) with circuit depths and ancillary-qubit numbers unrealistically large in the mid-term. Our main contribution is a new generation of deterministic, high-precision QITE algorithms that are significantly more amenable experimentally. A surprisingly simple idea is behind them: partitioning the evolution into a sequence of fragments that are run probabilistically. It causes a considerable reduction in wasted circuit depth every time a run fails. Remarkably, the resulting overall runtime is asymptotically better than in coherent approaches, and the hardware requirements are even milder than in probabilistic ones. Our findings are especially relevant for the early fault-tolerance stages of quantum hardware. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Government of Spain, (FIS2020-TRANQI); Severo Ochoa CEX2019-000910-S; Fundación Cellex; Centres de Recerca de Catalunya, CERCA; European Research Council, ERC; Generalitat de Catalunya; Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca, AGAUR, (SGR 1381); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (305420/2018-6); Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, FAPERJ, (JCN E-26/202.701/2018, PDR10 E-26/202.802/2016); Instituto Serrapilheira, (Serra-1709-17173); Fundación Mig-Puig","Funding text 1: We thank Martin Kliesch for helpful comments that led us to write, Sec.

Several decades ago, it was proposed that at low temperatures and high pressures, solid hydrogen would be a metal with a high superconducting transition temperature. This transition to a metallic state can happen through the closing of the energy gap in the molecular solid or through a transition to an atomic solid. Recent experiments have managed to reach pressures in the range of 400-500 GPa, providing valuable insights. There is strong evidence suggesting that metallization via either of these mechanisms occurs within this pressure range. Computational and experimental studies have identified multiple promising crystal phases, but the limited accuracy of calculations and the limited capabilities of experiments prevent us from determining unequivocally the observed phase or phases. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the superconducting properties of all the candidate phases. Recently, we reported the superconducting properties of the C2/c-24, Cmca-12, Cmca-4 and I41/amd-2 phases, including anharmonic effects. Here, we report the effects of anisotropy on superconducting properties using Eliashberg theory. Then, we investigate the superconducting properties of deuterium and estimate the size of the isotope effect for each phase. We find that the isotope effect on superconductivity is diminished by anharmonicity in the C2/c-24 and Cmca-12 phases and enlarged in the Cmca-4 and I41/amd-2 phases. Our anharmonic calculations of the C2/c-24 phase of deuterium agree closely with the most recent experiment by Loubeyre et al (2022 Phys. Rev. Lett. 29 035501), indicating that the C2/c-24 phase remains the leading candidate in this pressure range, and has a strong anharmonic character. These characteristics can serve to distinguish among crystal phases in experiment. Furthermore, expanding our understanding of superconductivity in pure hydrogen holds significance in the study of high-Tc hydrides. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","deuterium; first-principles; high-pressure; hydrogen; isotope effect; superconductivity","Anisotropy; Computation theory; High pressure effects; Superconducting transition temperature; Anharmonic; Anisotropy effect; Crystal phasis; First principles; High pressure; Isotope effect; Key objective; Pressure ranges; Solid hydrogen; Superconducting properties; Deuterium","Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment; Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, (ACI-1928147, DE-AC02- 05CH11231); Texas Advanced Computing Center; XSEDE, (ACI-1053575, OAC-1818253); National Science Foundation, NSF, (2139536); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC2301); Office of Science, SC; Basic Energy Sciences, BES; Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering, DMSE","M L C acknowledges support by the Director, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231, within the Theory of Materials program (KC2301), which supported the structure optimization and calculation of vibrational properties.

In this paper, we have suggested the synthesized hybrid systems formed by chemical derivation into middle parts of b-AGNRs, and then investigated the band structures and thermoelectric properties of electron part as function of out-layer strain and elastic strain along ribbon direction. The calculated results reveal that all hybrid systems are stable structurally and the band gaps of the systems increase remarkably from 0.04 to 1.59 eV under different strains. When the strain along periodical direction change 4 % and 12 %, the thermoelectric characteristics are noticeably enhanced than other strains. Especially, the systems formed by graphane exhibit the electronic figure of merit (ZTe) of 0.95. In the case of hc < h0, the dependence of the thermoelectric properties of electron part in hybrid b-AGNRs on the out-layer strain is insignificant. © 2023","Bilayer graphene nanoribbon; Chemical derivation; Out-layer; Strain; Thermoelectric properties","Energy gap; Graphene; Hybrid systems; Nanoribbons; Strain; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; Bilayer graphene nanoribbons; Chemical derivation; Direction change; Elastic-strains; Lattice thermal conductivity; Out-layer; Phonon-glass electron-crystals; Structure property; Synthesised; Thermoelectric properties; Electrons","","","N.-C.

Computed quantities such as the bulk K, shear G, and Young’s E moduli were used to evaluate the mechanical behavior of the studied materials. The Pugh ratio γ and Poisson’s ratio ν were utilized to quantify the ductility of the alloys. Through comparative charge density analysis, we illustrated the relationship between the relative charge distributions and the aforementioned ductility metrics. Among the 52 studied alloys, 27 were determined to be stable/metastable at room temperature, and each of these stable/metastable materials are expected to be ductile. To facilitate the discovery and implementation of thermodynamically accessible and ductile solders, this work focuses on the mechanical properties of the alloys expected to be stable/metastable. Based on the cutoff criteria for stability and ductility established at the end of this work ( E F o r m < 10 meV/atom and γ > 4.00), the α-Ga0.125In0.875, GaII0.750In0.250, GaII0.833Sn0.167 and In0.875Ga0.125 alloys warrant further study for soldering applications. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","density-functional theory; ductility; mechanical properties; solders","Binary alloys; Density (specific gravity); Ductility; Lead-free solders; Soldering; Tin alloys; Charge-density analysis; Density-functional-theory; E-modulus; Elastic properties; First-principles modeling; Mechanical behavior; Metastable materials; Metastables; S ratio; Soldering applications; Density functional theory","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1548562); Binghamton University, (MAT210038)","This work received funding from Binghamton University’s First-year Research Immersion program and the SUNY Performance Improvement Fund, Clean Energy Community of Practice.

Acting as a post-processing tool for a density-functional perturbation theory code (Quantum ESPRESSO) and WANNIER90, EPIq exploits the localization of the deformation potential in the Wannier function basis and the stationary properties of a force-constant functional with respect to the first-order perturbation of the electronic charge density to calculate many electron-phonon related properties with high accuracy and free from convergence issues related to Brillouin zone sampling. EPIq features include: the adiabatic and non-adiabatic phonon dispersion, superconducting properties (including the superconducting band gap in the Migdal-Eliashberg formulation), double-resonant Raman spectra and lifetime of excited carriers. The possibility to customize most of its input makes EPIq a versatile and interoperable tool. Particularly relevant is the interaction with the Stochastic Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SSCHA) allowing anharmonic effects to be included in the calculation of electron-properties. The scalability offered by the Wannier representation combined with a straightforward workflow and easy-to-read input and output files make EPIq accessible to the wide condensed matter and material science communities.

Lawsone's anti-cancer abilities against breast cancer proteins was investigated using molecular docking analysis. The optimization was performed through 6-311++G (d,p) basis set to determine the molecular geometry of lawsone. The vibrational frequencies of Lawsone were theoretically generated and compared to analytically determined FTIR and FT-Raman spectra. In this study, a theoretical UV–visible spectrum was generated, and experimental absorption was validated. The reactive potential of lawsone was explored further using a molecular electrostatic potential surface. The HOMO-LUMO energies and energy gap were used to evaluate the stability and molecular reactivity of the lawsone molecule. The charge distribution across the lawsone atoms was found via Mulliken and natural population analyses. The weak interactions of the lawsone molecule were analysed through RDG analysis. The topology of the lawsone molecule was explored through ELF and LOL analysis. The antioxidant potential was validated using the DPPH test. The drug-like features of lawsone were confirmed by physicochemical and pharmacokinetic tests, and molecular docking simulations revealed lawsone's binding affinity against breast cancer proteins, with the greatest affinity of –7.4 Kcal/mol observed against AKT1. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","ADMET; Breast cancer; DFT; ELF; Lawsone; LOL; Molecular docking","Absorption spectroscopy; Binding energy; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Diseases; Electronic properties; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Molecular modeling; Pharmacokinetics; Proteins; Quantum chemistry; 'current; ADMET; Breast Cancer; Density-functional-theory; ELF; Lawsone; LOL; Molecular docking; Quantum simulations; Structural characteristics; Molecules","Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DBT, (BT/PR44695/NER/95/1880/2021)","This work was supported by a Grant-aid from the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) , BT/PR44695/NER/95/1880/2021 ","T.

Herein, we demonstrate that the ORR activity of FeNC can be markedly enhanced by the incorporation of adjacent Fe few-atom clusters (FeAC), where the octahedral field of FeAC boosts the splitting of the parallelogram field of FeN4, and facilitates the transition from high-spin (t2g3eg2) Fe(III)N4 to medium-spin (t2g5eg1) Fe(II)N4 and hence the interaction with the π* antibonding orbitals of oxygen. This leads to a remarkable ORR performance due to optimized desorption of the OH* intermediate on FeN4, with a half-wave potential of +0.80 in 0.1 M HClO4, in comparison to that with only FeN4 single-atom moieties. In H2-O2 fuel cell tests, a high peak power density of 0.80 W cm−2 is obtained. Results from this work highlight the significance of spin engineering in the manipulation and optimization of the ORR activity of single-atom catalysts. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Few-atom cluster; Oxygen reduction reaction; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell; Single atom site; Spin state","Atoms; Catalyst activity; Electrolytic reduction; Oxygen; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Spin dynamics; Atom clusters; Atomic clusters; Few-atom cluster; Oxygen reduction reaction; Proton-exchange membranes fuel cells; Reaction activity; Single atom site; Single-atoms; Spin state; ]+ catalyst; Iron compounds","National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for Undergraduate, (202110559044); Special Funds for the Cultivation of Guangdong College Students' Scientific and Technological Innovation, (pdjh2022b0065); National Science Foundation, NSF, (CHE-1900235, CHE-2003685); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (21576301, 22005120, 22075102, 22209056, 51973244); Postdoctoral Research Foundation of China, (2020M673071); Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project, (201605030008, 202201010360); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (21620329, 21621007); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2022A1515010523, 2023A1515010270)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 22075102 , 22005120 , 21576301 , 51973244 , 22209056 ); the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 21620329 , 21621007 ); the Postdoctoral Research Foundation of China ( 2020M673071 ); the Special Funds for the Cultivation of Guangdong College Students' Scientific and Technological Innovation ( pdjh2022b0065 ); the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation ( 2022A1515010523 , 2023A1515010270 ); the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou ( 201605030008 , 202201010360 ) and the National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for Undergraduate ( 202110559044 ).

Understanding the underlying physical mechanisms hinges on knowledge of the crystal structures of these molecular phases. That is especially true for ζ-N2, key to shed light on nitrogen’s polymerization. Here, we perform single-crystal X-ray diffraction on laser-heated N2 samples at 54, 63, 70 and 86 GPa and solve and refine the hitherto unknown structure of ζ-N2. In its monoclinic unit cell (space group C2/c), 16 N2 molecules are arranged in a configuration similar to that of ε-N2. The structure model provides an explanation for the previously identified Raman and infrared lattice and vibrational modes of ζ-N2. Density functional theory calculations give an insight into the gradual delocalization of electronic density from intramolecular bonds to intermolecular space and suggest a possible pathway towards nitrogen’s polymerization. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","electron density; polymerization","EuroHPC; National Science Foundation—Earth Sciences, (EAR—1634415); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC, (DE-AC02-06CH11357); Argonne National Laboratory, ANL; University of Chicago; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (MR/V025724/1); Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, DESY; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (DU 393–13/1, DU 393–9/2, DU 954–11/1); European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, ESRF; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (05K19WC1); Linköpings Universitet, LiU, (2009 00971); Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse, (KAW-2018.0194); Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2018-05973, 2019-05600, 2022-06725, SNIC 2022/1-6); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (SNIC 2022/13-3, SNIC 2022/21-10)","Funding text 1: The authors thank E.

However, it remains a challenging task nowadays to accurately predict the canonical tautomeric form of a given drug-like molecule. Lack of extensive tautomer databases, most likely due to the difficulty in experimental studies, hampers the development of effective empirical methods for tautomer predictions. A more accurate estimation of the stable tautomeric form can be achieved by quantum chemistry calculations. Yet, the computational cost required prevents quantum chemistry calculation as a standard tool for tautomer prediction in computer-aided drug discovery. In this paper we propose a hybrid quantum chemistry-quantum computation workflow to efficiently predict the dominant tautomeric form. Specifically, we select active-space molecular orbitals based on quantum chemistry methods. Then we utilize efficient encoding methods to map the Hamiltonian onto quantum devices to reduce the qubit resources and circuit depth. Finally, variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms are employed for ground state estimation where hardware-efficient ansatz circuits are used. To demonstrate the applicability of our methodology, we perform experiments on two tautomeric systems: acetone and Edaravone, each having 52 and 150 spin-orbitals in the Slater Type Orbital - 3 Gaussian (STO-3G) basis set, respectively. Our numerical results show that their tautomeric state prediction agrees with the Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) benchmarks. Moreover, the required quantum resources are efficient: in the example of Edaravone, we could achieve chemical accuracy with only eight qubits and 80 two-qubit gates. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Acetone; Computational chemistry; Computational efficiency; Ground state; Molecular orbitals; Numerical methods; Qubits; Accurate estimation; Computer-aided drug discovery; Edaravone; Empirical method; Most likely; Quantum chemistry calculations; Quantum simulations; State prediction; Tautomeric forms; Tautomerics; Forecasting","","","Y.-C.

Its realization on noisy quantum computers without fault tolerance, however, is challenging because it requires a deep quantum circuit in general. We propose a strategy to run an entire QSP protocol on noisy quantum hardware by carefully reducing overhead costs at each step. To illustrate the approach, we consider the application of Hamiltonian simulation for which QSP implements a polynomial approximation of the time evolution operator. We test the protocol by running the algorithm on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer powered by Honeywell. In particular, we compute the time dependence of bipartite entanglement entropies for Ising spin chains and find good agreements with exact numerical simulations. To make the best use of the device, we determine optimal experimental parameters by using a simplified error model for the hardware and numerically studying the trade-off between Hamiltonian simulation time, polynomial degree, and total accuracy. Our results are the first step in the experimental realization of QSP-based quantum algorithms. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Computer hardware; Economic and social effects; Fault tolerance; Ising model; Polynomial approximation; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Signal processing; Trapped ions; Asymptotically optimal; Computational costs; Overhead costs; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum signal processing; Signal processing protocol; Time evolution operator; Trapped ion; Hamiltonians","","","Y.

These domains are widely distributed in the (111)-textured MgO layer, being different from conventional bcc-CoFe/MgO(001)-based MTJs. The (111)-texture is formed by extension of {111} planes through several adjacent MgO domains. Three types of orientation relationships (ORs) between CoFe and MgO are identified, including cube-on-cube type (Type-1), twin-like type (Type-2), and unexpected type (Type-3). Crystallographic analysis indicated that Type-2 OR is a variant of Type-1 OR, triggered by different stacking orders of MgO(111) planes, while Type-3 OR is formed by a 30° in-plane rotation of MgO lattice relative to Type-1 OR. Due to the large in-plane lattice mismatch (19.6%) between Co(111) and MgO(111) in Type-1 and Type-2 ORs, Type-3 OR (mismatch 3.4%) can be stabilized. First-principles calculations uncovered that the theoretical TMR ratio of the MgO(111) MTJ with Type-3 OR is ∼2 orders of magnitude smaller than that with Type-1 and Type-2 ORs. The small contribution of Type-3 OR to the transport reasonably interprets why the experimental TMR ratio (∼37%) is much lower than the theoretical value (∼2100%) in the Co/MgO/Co(111) MTJ. This study has revealed the nano-crystal domain formation unique to the fcc-CoFe/MgO(111) MTJs, indicating that controlling the nano-crystal domains (e.g., lattice optimization by atomic doping) can be a guiding principle to develop MgO(111)-based epitaxial MTJs and related heterostructure devices. © 2023 Acta Materialia Inc.","Epitaxial growth; Magnetic tunnel junctions; Microstructure; Nano-crystal domains; Tunneling magnetoresistance","Binary alloys; Domain walls; Doping (additives); Epitaxial growth; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Lattice mismatch; Magnetic devices; Magnetic domains; Scanning electron microscopy; Textures; Tunnel junctions; Tunnelling magnetoresistance; Co based; Crystal domain; First principle calculations; Magnetic tunnel junction; Magnetoresistance ratio; Nano-crystal domain; Nano-crystals; Orientation relationship; Tunnel magnetoresistance; Tunneling magnetoresistance; Magnesia","Spintronic Materials in NIMS; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (20K14782, 21H01750, 22H04966, 23K03933); Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, CREST, (JPMJCR19J4); National Institute for Materials Science, NIMS","Funding text 1: This research was partly supported by JST CREST ( JPMJCR19J4 ), and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Nos. 20K14782 , 21H01750 , 22H04966 , and 23K03933 .

In this paper, we propose a new quantum image representation of RGB images with deterministic image retrieval, which is an improvement over all the similar existing representations in terms of using minimum resource. We use two entangled quantum registers constituting of total 7 qutrits to encode the color channels and their intensities. Additionally, we generalize the existing encoding methods by using both qubits and qutrits to encode the pixel positions of a rectangular image. This hybrid-qudit approach aligns well with the current progress of NISQ devices in incorporating higher dimensional quantum systems than qubits. We then describe the image encoding method using higher-order qubit-qutrit gates, and demonstrate the decomposition of these gates in terms of simpler elementary gates. We use the Google Cirq’s quantum simulator to verify the image preparation in both the ideal noise-free scenario and in presence of realistic noise modelling. We show that the complexity of the image encoding process is linear in the number of pixels. Lastly, we discuss the image compression and some basic RGB image processing protocols using our representation. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (828946)","The work was financially supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under FET-OPEN Grant Agreement No. 828946 (PATHOS).

To address this challenge, we develop a machine learning approach to efficiently predict density–density response functions (DDRF) in materials. An atomic decomposition of the DDRF is introduced, as well as the neighborhood density–matrix descriptor, both of which transform in the same way under rotations. The resulting DDRFs are then used to evaluate quasiparticle energies via the GW approach. To assess the accuracy of this method, we apply it to hydrogenated silicon clusters and find that it reliably reproduces HOMO–LUMO gaps and quasiparticle energy levels. The accuracy of the predictions deteriorates when the approach is applied to larger clusters than those in the training set. These advances pave the way for GW calculations of complex systems, such as disordered materials, liquids, interfaces, and nanoparticles. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Inverse problems; Atomic decomposition; Density response function; Dielectric matrixes; GW calculations; Highly accurate; ITS applications; Large system; Machine learning approaches; Neighbourhood; Quasiparticle energy; Matrix algebra","Center for Doctoral Training on Theory and Simulation of Materials at Imperial College London; National Supercomputing Service, (EP/L000202); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/L015579/1); Thomas Young Centre, TYC, (TYC-101)","This work was supported through a studentship in the Center for Doctoral Training on Theory and Simulation of Materials at Imperial College London funded by the EPSRC (EP/L015579/1).

In most cases, the defect caused a structural phase transition in the lizardite from the trigonal (pristine) to the triclinic phase. The results show that oxygen vacancies in lizardite significantly reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, accompanied by an elastic moduli reduction and an anisotropy index increase. Through the P–V relation, an increase in compressibility was evidenced for vacancy configurations. Except for the vacancy with the same crystalline structure as pristine lizardite, the sound velocities of the other vacancy configurations produce a decrease in these velocities, and it is essential to highlight high values for the Grüneisen parameter. We emphasize the great relevance of the punctual-defects introduction, such as O vacancies, in lizardite, since this microstructural design is responsible for the decrease of the lattice thermal conductivity in comparison with the pristine system by decreasing the heat transfer ability, turning lizardite into a promising candidate for thermoelectric materials © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Amazonas Research Support Foundation; Atos Computers; CIMATEC; Centro Nacional de Supercomputação; GEOTEC; Rio Grande do Sul Research Foundation; SENAI CIMATEC; Universidade Federal do Amazonas, UFAM; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (13XP5094A); Ministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst Baden-Württemberg, MWK; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (311682/2021-9); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, FAPERGS, (307345/2021-1); Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos, FINEP; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas, FAPEAM; Universidade Estadual de Campinas, UNICAMP; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, UFRJ","Funding text 1: H.

The calculations are performed using the QUANTUM-ESPRESSO package which is based on the density functional theory (DFT) and the pseudo-potential method. The calculated elasticity parameters illustrated that the rock-salt phase complies with the mechanical stability conditions at ambient pressure. Based on the results of the mechanical calculations, it can be concluded that AgI is more rigid than other silver halide compounds, while the AgF compound is more malleable than other silver halide compounds. Also, against other examined silver halides, the AgI compound has an isotropic nature. The phonon scattering diagram has proved the dynamic stability of silver halide compounds in the studied rock-salt phase. Evaluation of the electronic results indicates that silver halide compounds in both GGA and HSE approximations have an indirect bandgap in the L−Γ path. In comparison to GGA, the HSE calculation improves the amount of bandgap toward a better agreement with experimental results. At room temperature, the hole mobility of silver halides is much less than the electron mobility. The decreasing trend of the effective mass of electrons in silver halides with the atomic radius of halide in the rock-salt phase leads to a faster carrier transfer rate in AgI, AgBr, AgCl, and AgF compounds, respectively. Moreover, by increasing the atomic radius of halide atom X, the Debye temperature θD and stiffness decrease, and inversely the heat capacity Cv increases. The increasing entropy relative to temperature refers to the endothermic properties of silver halide compounds. In both GGA and HSE approximations, the AgF compound has the highest absorption coefficient peak with the maximum optical absorption in the ultraviolet regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. The absorption coefficients of the silver halide compounds are of the order of 105 cm−1 which is comparable to the absorption coefficient of silicon crystals. The latter property along with a high stability and high electron mobility, makes silver halides attractive photocatalytic materials in the NaCl structure. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Electronic properties; Mechanical stability; Optical properties; Semiconductor; Silver halide compounds; Thermal properties","","Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, (SP1401.113)","P.

Recent experimental searches for these textures have focused on CrI3, known to exhibit either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic interlayer order, depending on layer stacking. However, the very strong uniaxial anisotropy of CrI3 disfavors smooth non-collinear phases in twisted bilayers. Here, we report the experimental observation of three distinct magnetic phases—one ferromagnetic and two antiferromagnetic—in exfoliated CrBr3 multilayers, and reveal that the uniaxial anisotropy is significantly smaller than in CrI3. These results are obtained by magnetoconductance measurements on CrBr3 tunnel barriers and Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with density functional theory calculations, which enable us to identify the stackings responsible for the different interlayer magnetic couplings. The detection of all locally stable magnetic states predicted to exist in CrBr3 and the excellent agreement found between theory and experiments, provide complete information on the stacking-dependent interlayer exchange energy and establish twisted bilayer CrBr3 as an ideal system to deterministically create non-collinear magnetic phases. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","magnetic anisotropy; probability density function; stacking; anisotropy; article; density functional theory; Raman spectrometry","Italian Ministry for University and Research; Shaanxi Fundamental Science Research Project for Mathematics and Physics, (22JSY026); European Commission, EC; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (92265103); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","The authors gratefully acknowledge Alexandre Ferreira for technical support.

In recent years, both quantum computing and machine learning have shown great promise in the field of document classification. However, there is a lack of research investigating the performance of these techniques on the Arabic language. This paper presents a comparative study of quantum computing and machine learning for two datasets of Arabic language document classification. In the first dataset of 213,465 Arabic tweets, both classic machine learning (ML) and quantum computing approaches achieve high accuracy in sentiment analysis, with quantum computing slightly outperforming classic ML. Quantum computing completes the task in approximately 59 min, slightly faster than classic ML, which takes around 1 h. The precision, recall, and F1 score metrics indicate the effectiveness of both approaches in predicting sentiment in Arabic tweets. Classic ML achieves precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.8215, 0.8175, and 0.8121, respectively, while quantum computing achieves values of 0.8239, 0.8199, and 0.8147, respectively. In the second dataset of 44,000 tweets, both classic ML (using the Random Forest algorithm) and quantum computing demonstrate significantly reduced processing times compared to the first dataset, with no substantial difference between them. Classic ML completes the analysis in approximately 2 min, while quantum computing takes approximately 1 min and 53 s. The accuracy of classic ML is higher at 0.9241 compared to 0.9205 for quantum computing. However, both approaches achieve high precision, recall, and F1 scores, indicating their effectiveness in accurately predicting sentiment in the dataset. Classic ML achieves precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.9286, 0.9241, and 0.9249, respectively, while quantum computing achieves values of 0.92456, 0.9205, and 0.9214, respectively. The analysis of the metrics indicates that quantum computing approaches are effective in identifying positive instances and capturing relevant sentiment information in large datasets. On the other hand, traditional machine learning techniques exhibit faster processing times when dealing with smaller dataset sizes. This study provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of quantum computing and machine learning for Arabic document classification, emphasizing the potential of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy, particularly in scenarios where traditional machine learning techniques may encounter difficulties. These findings contribute to the development of more accurate and efficient document classification systems for Arabic data. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Computing Methodologies; Humans; Language; Machine Learning; Quantum Theory; Sentiment Analysis; Social Media; Arabic (language); article; comparative study; controlled study; human; human experiment; machine learning; random forest; recall; sentiment analysis; social media; computer analysis; language; machine learning; quantum theory; sentiment analysis","Department of Computer Science, Saarland University","Authors sincerely acknowledge Computer Science Department in Faculty of Science, Minia University for the facilities and support.","A.

Replacing Ce3+ (4f 1, J = 5/2) with Sm3+ (4f 5, J = 5/2), we show that a combination of the crystal electric field and on-site Coulomb repulsion causes SmCoIn5 to exhibit a Γ7 ground state similar to CeCoIn5 with multiple f electrons. We show that with this single-ion ground state, SmCoIn5 exhibits a temperature-induced valence crossover consistent with a Kondo scenario, leading to increased delocalization of f holes below a temperature scale set by the crystal field, Tv ≈ 60 K. Our result provides evidence that in the case of many f electrons, the crystal field remains the dominant tuning knob in controlling the efficiency of delocalization near a heavy fermion quantum critical point, and additionally clarifies that charge fluctuations play a general role in the ground state of “115” materials. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Cerium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Electric fields; Ground state; Indium alloys; Quantum theory; Rare earths; Ternary alloys; Band formations; Charge fluctuations; Crystal fields; Delocalizations; F-electrons; Heavy-fermion; Intermediate valence; Microscopic mechanisms; Rare-earths; Unconventional superconductivity; Efficiency","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (206312019002, 884104); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (200021_184983); National Center of Competence in Research Materials’ Revolution: Computational Design and Discovery of Novel Materials, NCCR MARVEL; NCCR Catalysis, NCCR, (205602)","We are grateful for useful discussions with Andriy Nevidomskyy, Qimiao Si, Collin Broholm, Markus Müller, and Manfred Sigrist, and we thank Uwe Stuhr for asistance with planning the Eiger experiments, Romain Sibille for assistance with the MS experiments, and Jamie Massey for assistance with the VSM measurements.

However, with the exponential increase in the number of images and the complexity of the required tasks, deep-learning classification algorithms demand more intensive resources and computational power to train the models and update the massive number of parameters. Quantum computing is a new research technology with a promising capability of exponential speed up and operational parallelization with its unique phenomena including superposition and entanglement. Researchers have already started utilizing Quantum Deep Learning (QDL) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in image classification. Yet, to our knowledge, there exists no comprehensive published literature review on quantum image classification. Therefore, this paper analyzes the advances in this field by dividing the studies based on a unique taxonomy, discussing the limitations, summarizing essential aspects of each research, and finally, emphasizing the gaps, challenges, and recommendations. One of the key challenges presented in the paper is that quantum computers are in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, where they contain a limited number of noisy qubits, therefore challenging complex quantum classifiers and complex images from advanced datasets.

The observation of moiré patterns in mechanically stacked graphene layers has triggered rapid progress in graphene research. These moiré patterns arise due to the relative difference in the orientation of the mechanically stacked graphene layers. Since their first appearance, moiré superlattices have become a platform for advanced materials and different quantum phenomena. Graphene bilayer, obtained from the mechanical stacking of two decoupled graphene layers, has become archetypal. Weak inter-layer forces can sometimes induce angular disorder in the array that causes unconventional stacking of layers. This unconventional stacking induces several angle-dependent properties in twisted bilayer graphene (t-BLG) which are unprecedented for graphene itself. This review examines recent advances in t-BLG covering aspects of its electronic structure, fabrication, angle-dependent properties and the spectroscopic signatures. © 2023 The Author(s)","Brillouin zones; Moiré patterns; Superconductivity; Twisted bilayer graphene; van der Waal heterostructures","","","","A.H.

This study aimed to develop a nomogram based on easy-to-obtain blood-derived biofactors for identifying ultra high-risk NB patients with highest risk of death within 3 or 5 years. Methods: One hundred sixty-seven NB patients who treated at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between 2015 and 2023 were recruited and clustered randomly into training and validation cohorts (116 and 51 cases, respectively). Univariate and multivariate Cox analysis were performed in training set to screen independent prognostic indicators for constructing nomogram model of predicting 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS). The discrimination power of the nomogram in training and validation sets were assessed by concordance index (C-index) and calibration plot. Based on the risk score obtained from nomogram model, the prognostic accuracy of 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates in training and validation cohorts were further evaluated using the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC). Results: Through univariate and multivariate Cox analysis, independent prognostic indicators, including serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and albumin (ALB), were identified in training set, and used to establish a nomogram model. The model showed good discrimination power with C-index in training cohort being 0.706 (95%CI: 0.633—0.788). According to the cut-point calculated based on the established nomogram, patients with a nomogram score > 34 points could be stratified to ultra high-risk NB subgroup, and this subgroup had poorer OS than those in non-ultra one (p < 0.001). AUC values of ROC curves for 3- and 5-year OS rates in the training set were 0.758 and 0.756, respectively. Moreover, based on the cut-point score (34 points) developed in training set, The model also showed good discrimination power with C-index of 0.773 (95%CI: 0.664—0.897) and powerful prognostic accuracy of AUC for 3- and 5-year OS rates being 0.825 and 0.826, respectively, in validation cohort. Conclusions: We developed a simple-to-use nomogram based on common laboratory indicators to identify the subgroup of ultra high-risk NB before treatment, providing these children even from developing countries or regions access to intensified multimodal treatments earlier and thus improving their long-term outcome. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Albumin; Developing country/region; Lactate dehydrogenase; Nomogram; Overall survival; Pretreatment; Ultra high-risk neuroblastoma","Albumins; Child; Combined Modality Therapy; Hospitals; Humans; Infant; Neuroblastoma; Nomograms; albumin; biochemical marker; creatinine; globulin; lactate dehydrogenase; albumin; albumin blood level; albumin to globulin ratio; analytical parameters; Article; biochemical analysis; blood analysis; calibration; cancer center; cancer prognosis; cancer risk; cancer survival; child; China; Chinese; clinical indicator; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; concordance index; controlled study; creatinine blood level; demographics; developing country; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; discriminant validity; disease risk assessment; female; high risk population; human; human cell; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; leukocyte count; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis; neuroblastoma; neutrophil count; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; nomogram; overall survival; patient identification; patient selection; pediatric patient; platelet count; prediction; predictive value; preschool child; proportional hazards model; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; statistical parameters; survival time; univariate analysis; university hospital; validation study; hospital; infant; multimodality cancer therapy","","","W.

We discover that the superlattice adopts A-type antiferromagnetic (A-AFM) ordering in contrast to its constituents (SrCrO3: C-AFM; YCrO3: G-AFM) and retains it under compressive strain while becoming ferromagnetic (5 μB per formula unit) at +1% strain. The obtained ferroelectric polarization is significantly higher than that of the R2NiMnO6/La2NiMnO6 (R = Ce to Er) series of superlattices [Nat. Commun. 5, 4021 (2014)] due to a large difference between the antipolar displacements of the Sr and Y cations. The superlattice is a hybrid-improper multiferroic material with a spontaneous ferroelectric polarization (13.5 μC/cm2) approaching that of bulk BaTiO3 (19 μC/cm2). The combination of ferromagnetism with ferroelectricity enables multistate memory applications. In addition, the charge-order-driven p-type semiconducting state of the ferromagnetic phase (despite the metallic nature of SrCrO3) is a rare property and interesting for spintronics. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate a magnetic critical temperature of 90 K for the A-AFM phase without strain and of 115 K for the ferromagnetic phase at +5% strain, for example. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Antiferromagnetism; Barium titanate; Chromium compounds; Ferroelectric materials; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Perovskite; Polarization; Strontium compounds; AFM; Antiferromagnetic orderings; Antiferromagnetics; Compressive strain; Electronic and magnetic properties; Epitaxial strain; Ferroelectric polarization; Ferromagnetic phasis; Ferromagnetics; Perovskite oxides; Ferroelectricity","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, KAUST","The research reported in this publication was supported by funding from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST).

Here we experimentally demonstrate three types of Chern insulators with synthetic dimensions on a programable 30-qubit-ladder superconducting processor. We directly measure the band structures of the 2D Chern insulator along synthetic dimensions with various configurations of Aubry-André-Harper chains and observe dynamical localisation of edge excitations. With these two signatures of topology, our experiments implement the bulk-edge correspondence in the synthetic 2D Chern insulator. Moreover, we simulate two different bilayer Chern insulators on the ladder-type superconducting processor. With the same and opposite periodically modulated on-site potentials for two coupled chains, we simulate topologically nontrivial edge states with zero Hall conductivity and a Chern insulator with higher Chern numbers, respectively.

In this work, we define and study the complexity class NISQ, which encapsulates problems that can be efficiently solved by a classical computer with access to noisy quantum circuits. We establish super-polynomial separations in the complexity among classical computation, NISQ, and fault-tolerant quantum computation to solve some problems based on modifications of Simon’s problems. We then consider the power of NISQ for three well-studied problems. For unstructured search, we prove that NISQ cannot achieve a Grover-like quadratic speedup over classical computers. For the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, we show that NISQ only needs a number of queries logarithmic in what is required for classical computers. Finally, for a quantum state learning problem, we prove that NISQ is exponentially weaker than classical computers with access to noiseless constant-depth quantum circuits. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","complexity; computer simulation; equipment; quantum mechanics; algorithm; Article; computer model; human; noisy intermediate scale quantum; quantum mechanics","NISQ; National Science Foundation, NSF, (2103300); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-SC0007870); Society of Fellows, Harvard University; Google","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Isaac Chuang for valuable conversations on complexity classes for learning theory, John Preskill for inspiring discussions on NISQ and its complexity class formulation, and John Wright for bringing76and related works to our attention.

The quaternary Heusler structured LiMgAgAl and LiMgAgGa alloys possess a face centered cubic structure and belong to the space group F-43m (group No. 216). The band structure calculations reveal that these compounds are metallic. Further, the Fermi surface studies have demonstrated their metallic behavior.

The pressure and temperature dependencies of the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical and thermal conductivities were calculated and compared to the available experimental data.

In this paper, producing the distributed entangled state of superconducting (SC) qubits is considered using an entanglement swapping protocol in three successive stages. The SC qubit pairs (i,i+1 with i=1,3,5,7) , where each pair of the qubits has been placed on a separate chip, are initially prepared in maximally entangled states. The external magnetic fields on capacitively coupled pairs (2,3) and (6,7) are implemented for modulating the frequency of qubits. Then, the SC qubits (1,4) and (5,8) are converted into entangled states via operating proper measurements instead of Bell state measurement (which is generally a hard task). Finally, the distributed entangled state of target SC qubits (1,8) can be obtained by applying external magnetic fields on qubits (4,5) and via operating suitable measurements. This process is studied in the absence and presence of thermal decoherence effects. The concurrence, as a measure of entanglement between two target qubits, success probability of the distributed entangled states and the corresponding fidelities are evaluated, by which we find that the state of target SC qubits (1,8) is converted to Bell state with maximum entanglement at some moments of time. Under appropriate conditions the maximum of success probability of the obtained states in each stage approaches 1. However, the maxima of concurrence and success probability gradually decrease due to the thermal noise as time goes on. Moreover, compelling amounts of fidelity, success probability and entanglement can be obtained for the achieved entangled states. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; magnetic field; noise; probability","","","M.K.

For (U[sbnd]Th)/Pb system, apatite minerals have closure temperatures in the range of 375 to 600 °C and therefore can be used for the investigation of mid-temperature thermochronological and/or petrochronological questions i.e., the reconstruction of thermal events in Earth's crust. There is still uncertainty whether Pb diffusion in apatite is characterized by thermally activated volume and/or anisotropic diffusion profiles or is instead impacted by novel growth processes and recrystallization (chemical substitutions). As the apatite structure support extensive compositional variability, including partial or total substitution of both the cationic and anionic sites and forms solid solutions therefore, it necessitates a thorough examination of these effects and anisotropy on Pb diffusivity and (U[sbnd]Th)/Pb geochronometric system. For this, a multi-scale study is carried out to examine the effects of chemical composition, anisotropy, and growth structure on the diffusion of Pb in order to better understand the behaviour of Pb diffusion in apatite. This study employed computational techniques like Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Transition State Theory (TST) at the atomic level and integrates it with the Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations at the macroscopic level. Models of this study shows that Pb diffusion is completely anisotropic along the preferred z-axis or [001] direction and Pb readily escapes faster from Na-substituted apatite when compared to pure F-apatite and Cl-substituted apatite. Because of this anisotropy and chemical substitutions, Pb diffusivity in apatite either increases by opening of diffusion channels or decreases by blocking the diffusion channels depending on the site and type of chemical substitution. Further, in case of blocking effect the Pb diffusion occurs through workaround pathways and approaches towards the isotropic diffusion. For Na-substituted apatite, the impact of Na occupation on anisotropic Pb diffusion is significantly greater while in case of Cl-substituted apatite the Cl occupation mostly leads towards isotropic diffusion by opening the diffusion paths along other directions (mostly along the in-plane direction). Furthermore, the high closure temperatures (Tc) (e.g., ∼1370 °C) of the modelled apatites (except the perfect Na-substituted apatite e.g., ∼500 °C) of this study when compared to the Tc of Durango apatite obtained experimentally for the effective grain size of 100 μm and cooling rates of 10 °C/Ma indicate that the effective closure temperature dominantly depends on the degree and types of chemical substitutions and play a crucial role for the closure or opening of Pb diffusion/loss in apatites. © 2023","Apatite; Computation modelling; Lead diffusion; Petrochronology; U-Th/Pb dating","anisotropy; apatite; chronology; diffusion; heterogeneity; lead; numerical model; thorium; uranium-lead dating","Khushal Khan Khattak University, (386-388/PC/PAB/ KKKUK/21); Universität Wien; Higher Education Commision, Pakistan, HEC","Funding text 1: This research work is published from the PhD work of the first author, funded by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan under the Faculty Development Program for the Khushal Khan Khattak University, Karak, Pakistan with grant No. 386-388/PC/PAB/ KKKUK/21.

The RPES study indicates the presence of a charge-transfer screened 3 dnL̲ (L : hole in the N-2 p) and 3 dn-1 final-states in the valence band regime. The combined experimental electronic structure along with the orbital resolved electronic density of states from the first-principles calculations reveals the presence of Cr(3 d)-N(2 p) hybridized (3 dnL̲) states between lower Hubbard (3 dn-1) and upper Hubbard (3 dn+1) bands with onsite Coulomb repulsion energy (U) and charge-transfer energy (Δ) estimated as ≈ 4.5 and 3.6 eV, respectively. It verifies the participation of ligand (N-2 p) states in low energy charge fluctuations and provides concrete evidence for the charge-transfer (Δ < U) insulating nature of CrN thin film. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","","","M.

When holes move through an antiferromagnetic spin background, they displace the positions of spins, which induces effective frustration in the magnetic environment. However, a concrete characterization of this effect in a quantum many-body system is still an unsolved problem. Here we present a Hamiltonian reconstruction scheme that allows for a precise quantification of hole-motion-induced frustration. We access non-local correlation functions through projective measurements of the many-body state, from which effective spin-Hamiltonians can be recovered after detaching the magnetic background from dominant charge fluctuations. The scheme is applied to systems of mixed dimensionality, where holes are restricted to move in one dimension, but SU(2) superexchange is two-dimensional. We demonstrate that hole motion drives the spin background into a highly frustrated regime, which can quantitatively be described by an effective J 1–J 2-type spin model. We exemplify the applicability of the reconstruction scheme to ultracold atom experiments by recovering effective spin-Hamiltonians of experimentally obtained 1D Fermi-Hubbard snapshots. Our method can be generalized to fully 2D systems, enabling promising microscopic perspectives on the doped Hubbard model. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Antiferromagnetic materials; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Quantum theory; Spin fluctuations; Antiferromagnetic spins; Antiferromagnets; Displacers; Effective spin Hamiltonian; Magnetic environments; Many body; Nonlocal; Quantum many-body systems; Quantum phase; Unsolved problems; Hamiltonians","Optical Physics at Harvard University; National Science Foundation, NSF; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (948141); European Research Council, ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (EXC-2111—390814868)","We are thankful for valuable discussions with F.

Quantum algorithms have shown promise in solving optimization problems, yet none of the current algorithms can effectively handle arbitrary constraints. We introduce a technique that uses quantum Zeno dynamics to solve optimization problems with multiple arbitrary constraints, including inequalities. We show that the dynamics of quantum optimization can be efficiently restricted to the in-constraint subspace on a fault-tolerant quantum computer via repeated projective measurements, requiring only a small number of auxiliary qubits and no post-selection. Our technique has broad applicability, which we demonstrate by incorporating it into the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and variational quantum circuits for optimization. We evaluate our method numerically on portfolio optimization problems with multiple realistic constraints and observe better solution quality and higher in-constraint probability than state-of-the-art techniques. We implement a proof-of-concept demonstration of our method on the Quantinuum H1-2 quantum processor. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Dynamics; Financial data processing; Global optimization; Quantum computers; Variational techniques; 'current; Arbitrary constraints; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Fault-tolerant; Optimization problems; Projective measurement; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum optimization; Quantum Zeno dynamics; Constrained optimization","Global Technology Applied Research center of JPMorgan; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM","The authors wish to thank Antonio Mezzacapo from IBM for his invaluable contributions to this project.

Advances in the synthesis, characterization, and analysis of 2D materials have been made by leaps and bounds, while the microscopic mechanisms and dynamics of their bioapplications remain unclear. Theoretical computations, such as density functional theory (DFT), have become increasingly popular and powerful in the past few years due to the availability of high-speed computing devices. As a result, in the last few years, theoretical calculations have been pivotal in exploring the underlying mechanisms of two-dimensional materials for biological applications. These calculations potentially further improve theoretical models to anticipate different physicochemical features and biological consequences of 2D materials or forecast the microscopic details of 2D materials for bioapplications to supplement experiments. This review highlights theoretical calculations of 2D materials applied to bioimaging, biosensing, disease diagnosis, drug delivery, and disease treatment.

The alloy composition of x= 0.125 , 0.25, 0.375, and 0.5 have been considered and the stability of the alloys has been proved by cohesive energy and phonon density of states results. Moreover, the bond lengths between atoms as structural properties have been studied for these alloy structures. The largest peak of quantum capacitance and the largest negative value of surface storage charge are for alloy composition of TiC with x= 0.125 with the values of 909.79 μ F/cm 2 and -1819.58μ C/cm 2 , respectively. Moreover, the results of the quantum capacitance and surface storage charge as a function of voltage for all Li alloy compounds are in the range of excellent supercapacitors and could have good potential to use as an electrode in the capacitor of Li-ion batteries. Furthermore, the electronic density of states of this group of alloys represents metallic behavior and therefore electrode material.

The phase relations among the four phases have been thoroughly investigated to better understand the high-pressure behavior of ZrO2, especially the upper part of the pressure phase transition sequence. Our enthalpy calculations revealed that the transformation from Ni2In phase to either AlB2 phase or CaC2 phase is unlikely to happen. On the other hand, a direct phase transition from Fe2P phase to Ni2In, CaC2 and AlB2 phases is predicted to occur at 325 GPa, 505 GPa and 1093 GPa, respectively. A deep discussion has been made on the Fe2P → Ni2In and Fe2P → CaC2 transitions in terms of the volume change, the coordination number (CN) change, and the band gap change to obtain a better prediction of the favored post-Fe2P phase of ZrO2. Additionally, the equation of state (EOS) parameters for each phase have been computed using Birch-Murnaghan EOS. To further investigate the phase stability testing, we have studied the components of the enthalpy difference to explore their effect on our findings, and found that all predicted transitions from Fe2P phase are driven by the volume reduction effect when compared to the slight effect of the electronic energy gain. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","","","Y.

Theoretical calculations of excitons in such systems are typically based on model moiré potentials that mitigate the computational cost. However, predictive understanding of the electron-hole coupling dominating the excitations is crucial to realize the twist-induced modifications of the optical selection rules. In this work, we use many-body perturbation theory to evaluate the relation between twist angle and exciton properties in TMD heterostructures. We present an approach for unfolding excitonic states from the moiré Brillouin zone onto the separate-layer ones. Applying this method to a large-angle twisted MoS2/MoSe2 bilayer, we find that the optical spectrum is dominated by mixed electron–hole transitions with different momenta in the separate monolayers, leading to unexpected hybridization between interlayer and intralayer excitons.

Through the application of first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, the following physical parameters are determined: Adiabatic temperature change, isothermal entropy change, and relative cooling power (RCP). The magnetic moments of Gadolinium, Terbium, and Dysprosium calculated by the PWSCF method are 6.76μB, 5.74μB, and 4.65μB respectively, aligning well with experimental results.

In addition to restrictions on AF structures, suitable control of AF domains is essential to observe this effect without cancellations among its domains; therefore, compatible materials remain limited. Here we show that an orthorhombic noncollinear AF material, NbMnP, acquired AF structure-based AHE and controllability of the AF domains. Theoretical calculations indicated that a large Hall conductivity of ~230 Ω−1cm−1 originated from the AF structure of NbMnP. Symmetry considerations explained the production of a small net magnetization, whose anisotropy enabled the generation and cancellation of the Hall responses using magnetic fields in different directions. Finally, asymmetric hysteresis in NbMnP shows potential for the development of controllability of responses in AF materials. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Hyogo Science and Technology Association, HSTA; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (18H04320, 18H04321, 19H01842, 21H01789, 21H04437, 21K03446, 23H04871); Tohoku University; Iketani Science and Technology Foundation; Murata Science Foundation","Funding text 1: We thank Hisatomo Harima and Youichi Yanase for valuable discussions and comments.

In this work, we have brought multifunctionality to a two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructure (vdW-HS) consisting of a layer of puckered silicene and indium selenide (InSe) through layer-sliding. Electronic, optical and interfacial properties of silicene/InSe vdW-HS have been varied dynamically by sliding silicene over InSe. The aforementioned layer-sliding is carried out in a gradual manner without and with Mg-intercalation. The buckling parameter relating to the corrugation of silicene drops from 0.438 Å to 0.351 Å on Mg-intercalation, whereas in the case of InSe buckling remains unaffected. The calculated band structure for un-intercalated vdW-HS shows a small band gap opening 205/210 meV with LDA/GGA functional) along high symmetry K direction in the first Brillion zone. The widening of the bandgap makes it suitable for optoelectronics and strain sensor devices, where a small band gap (0.1–1 eV) is required. To look inside into the interface of the vdW-HS, various interfacial electronic parameters such as planar average charge density difference (Δρ), dipole charge transfer (ΔQ) and dipole moment (Δµ) have been determined. It is found that the charge accumulation peaks have appeared near the silicene layer and the charge is transferred from silicene to the InSe layer in both un-intercalated and Mg-intercalated vdW-HSs. Further, we investigated the different optical parameters including real [ε1(ω)] and imaginary [ε2(ω)] parts of dielectric function (DF), energy loss function [L(ω)] and diagonal components of dielectric tensor [ε (iω)] for un-intercalated and Mg-intercalated vdW-HSs. The anisotropic analysis shows that the computed in-plane components significantly dominate the out-of-plane component of the DF, which show minor change as the sliding proceeds. The study endorses that multifunctional electronic 2D materials can be achievable by employing the layer-sliding dynamical strategy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Interfacial electronic properties; Layer-sliding; Mg-intercalation; Silicene/InSe vdW-HS; Tuning of properties","Charge transfer; Energy dissipation; Energy gap; Indium compounds; Selenium compounds; Silicene; Van der Waals forces; Indium selenide; Interfacial electronic property; Layer-sliding; Mg-intercalation; Multifunctionality; Property; Silicene; Silicene/indium selenide van der waal heterostructure; Tuning of property; Van der Waal; Electronic properties","University of Education","The authors thank the University of Education for providing computational support for the calculations.","M.

Most existing tools for the depiction of quantum speed limit are the lower-bound-type tools, which are in fact difficult to reveal the true minimum time, especially for many-body systems or complex dynamics. Therefore, the evaluation of this true minimum time in these scenarios is still an unsolved problem. Hereby we provide the operational definition of quantum speed limit for a general target and propose a three-step (classification-regression-calibration) methodology based on machine learning to evaluate the true minimum time in complex dynamics.

However, a critical challenge revolves around achieving a good balance between a large second harmonic generation (SHG) response and a high laser damage threshold (LDT). Based on earlier study on Li2SrSiS4 compound which showed good SHG and high LDT performances, and to afford one new NLO material, we propose, in this work to replace the Sr atom with a P-bloc (Pb) atom in the Li2SrSiS4 compound. According to DFT calculations, the newly designed Li2PbSiS4 compound crystallizes in the stable stannite structure. In addition, it is thermodynamically, dynamically and mechanically stable. The investigated material presents an indirect bandgap of 2.48 eV employing the HSE06 approach, including spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects. Moreover, the calculated SHG response is 0.85 × AgGaS2, which is larger than the SHG response of Li2SrSiS4. Furthermore, the SHG response increases directly with temperature, allowing using the compound at high temperatures. The obtained results may make the Li2PbSiS4 compound a promising NLO material. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH","DFT calculations; Optical properties; Quaternary chalcogenide semiconductor; Second harmonic generation","Density functional theory; Harmonic analysis; Harmonic generation; Laser damage; Lithium compounds; Military applications; Nonlinear optics; Optical materials; Silicon compounds; Strontium compounds; Chalcogenide semiconductors; Critical challenges; DFT calculation; Laser damage threshold; Military fields; NLO materials; Nonlinear optical materials; Quaternary chalcogenide semiconductor; Quaternary chalcogenides; Threshold performance; Optical properties","","","Z.

Direct growth of high-quality ZAGO epilayers however remains problematic due to the high volatility of zinc (Zn). This work highlights a novel synthesis process for high-quality epitaxial quaternary ZAGO thin films on sapphire substrates, achieved through thermal annealing of a ZnGa2O4 (ZGO) epilayer on sapphire in an ambient air setting. In-situ annealing x-ray diffraction measurements show that the incorporation of Al in the ZGO epilayer commenced at 850 °C. The Al content (x) in ZAGO epilayer gradually increased up to around 0.45 as the annealing temperature was raised to 1100 °C, which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. X-ray rocking curve measurement revealed a small full width at half maximum value of 0.72 °, indicating the crystal quality preservation of the ZAGO epilayer with a high Al content. However, an epitaxial intermediate β–(AlxGa1−x)2O3 layer (β - AGO) was formed between the ZAGO and sapphire substrate. This is believed to be a consequence of the interdiffusion of Al and Ga between the ZGO thin film and sapphire substrate. Using density functional theory, the substitution cost of Ga in sapphire was determined to be about 0.5 eV lower than substitution cost of Al in ZGO. Motivated by this energetically favorable substitution, a formation mechanism of the ZAGO and AGO layers was proposed. Spectroscopic ellipsometry studies revealed an increase in total thickness of the film from 105.07 nm (ZGO) to 147.97 nm (ZAGO/AGO) after annealing to 1100 °C, which were corroborated using TEM. Furthermore, an observed increase in the direct (indirect) optical bandgap from 5.06 eV (4.7 eV) to 5.72 eV (5.45 eV) with an increasing Al content in the ZAGO layer further underpins the formation of a quaternary ZAGO alloy with a tunable composition. © 2023 The Author(s)","Annealing; Bandgap; Ellipsometry; Interdiffusion; Semiconductors; Zinc aluminogallate","Alumina; Aluminum; Aluminum oxide; Annealing; Density functional theory; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Epilayers; Gallium; Gallium compounds; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Sapphire; Spectroscopic ellipsometry; Substrates; Thin films; Zinc; Zinc compounds; Aluminium content; Annealing; High quality; Interdiffusion; Sapphire substrates; Single-phase spinel structure; Thermally induced; Zinc aluminiums; Zinc aluminogallate; Zinc-aluminum; Energy gap","MAtek, (2021-T-006); Wafer Works Corporation; National Science and Technology Council, NSTC, (112-2218-E-A49-024-MBK, 112-2622-8-A49-013-SB); Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education, STINT, (MG2019-8485); Linköpings Universitet, LiU, (SFO-Mat-LiU 2009-00971); Olle Engkvists Stiftelse, (197–0210); Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2018–04198, 46658-1); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (111-2923-E-A49 -003 -MY3); Stiftelsen för Strategisk Forskning, SSF, (2009-00971)","This research was funded by Vetenskapsrådet ( 2018–04198 ), Energimyndigheten ( 46658-1 ), and Stiftelsen Olle Engkvist Byggmästare ( 197–0210 ), STINT ( MG2019-8485 ), and Stiftelsen för Strategisk Forskning ( 2009-00971 ).

Yet, there is no universal method that would simultaneously accurately account for strong electron-phonon interactions and electronic correlations. By combining methods of the variational quantum eigensolver and the variational non-Gaussian solver, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm suitable for this type of correlated systems. This hybrid method tackles systems with arbitrarily strong electron-phonon coupling without increasing the number of required qubits and quantum gates, as compared to purely electronic models. We benchmark our method by applying it to the paradigmatic Hubbard-Holstein model at half filling, and show that it correctly captures the competition between charge density wave and antiferromagnetic phases, quantitatively consistent with exact diagonalization. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Charge density; Charge density waves; Electrons; Quantum theory; Combining method; Eigensolvers; Electron phonon; Electronic correlation; Electrons and phonons; Non-Gaussian; Phonon system; Quantum-classical; Quantum-classical methods; Universal method; Electron-phonon interactions","Kenny Choo and Tao Shi; Texas Advanced Computing Center; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMR-2038011, DMR-2337930); Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-20-1-0163); International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; European Research Council, ERC; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; Universität Zürich, UZH, (FK-22-085); Horizon 2020, (ERC-StG-Neupert-757867-PARATOP)","Funding text 1: We acknowledge technical help from Vivek Dixit and Jiarui Liu and insightful discussions from Kenny Choo and Tao Shi.

Specifically, we focus on the physical qubit architecture, which affects state preparation, qubit-to-qubit connectivity, gate fidelities, native gate instruction set, and individual qubit stability. These factors determine both the quantum-part execution time and the end-to-end wall clock time relevant for end-users, but also the ability to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation in the future.

The test is done by way of experiment (x≤ 0.11), combining Raman scattering with X-ray diffraction at high pressure, and ab initio calculations (x ~ 0–0.5; x ~1). The (macroscopic) bulk modulus B drops below the CdTe value on minor Be incorporation, at variance with a linear B versus x increase predicted ab initio, thus hinting at large anharmonic effects in the real crystal. Yet, no anomaly occurs at the (microscopic) bond scale as the regular bimodal PM-type Raman signal predicted ab initio for Be–Te in minority (x ~0, 0.5) is barely detected experimentally. At large Be content (x ~1), the same bimodal signal relaxes all the way down to inversion, an unprecedented case. However, specific pressure dependencies of the regular (x ~0, 0.5) and inverted (x ~1) Be–Te Raman doublets are in line with the predictions of the PM. Hence, the PM applies as such to Cd1−xBexTe without further refinement, albeit in a “relaxed” form. This enhances the model’s validity as a generic descriptor of phonons in alloys. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","CRISTAL, (20110018); Institut de Minéralogie, de Physique des Matériaux et de Cosmochimie—Sorbonne Université; Université de Lorraine, UL, (2019CPMXX0918); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (LA/P/0037/2020, UIDB/50025/2020, UIDP/50025/2020)","We acknowledge assistance from the PSICHÉ (Cd1−x Bex Te, Proposal n°. 20220436, co-resps.

The spin–orbit torque efficiencies can be manoeuvred by application of mechanical strain. In this direction, this study furthers the effort in understanding the evolution of spin–orbit torque efficiencies in mechanically strained ferromagnet (FM)/heavy metal(HM) (Ni81Fe19/Pt) bi-layer films on flexible kapton substrate, by the use of spin torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurement technique. We report a tensile strain induced enhancement in damping-like and field-like spin–orbit torque efficiencies. The effective damping-like spin torque conductivity increased by 42% on the application of 0.312% tensile strain, which is encouraging from the magnetization switching application point of view. In order to investigate the driving factors behind the enhanced damping-like spin torque conductivity, ab-initio calculations were also carried out. Our findings provide insights into the workings of strain in FM/HM bi-layer stack and is a step forward in the implementation of flexible spintronics devices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Flexible spintronics; Mechanically strained thin films; Spin Hall conductivity; Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance; Spin–orbit torque efficiency","Damping; Efficiency; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetic resonance; Ferromagnetism; Magnetization; Tensile strain; Bi-layer; Ferromagnets; Flexible spintronic; Mechanically strained thin film; Spin hall conductivity; Spin orbits; Spin torque; Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance; Spin–orbit torque efficiency; Strained thin films; Torque","Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, IIT","Authors are thankful for the support provided by IIT- Bombay Nanofabrication Facility, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.","A.

They can be exfoliated down to the two-dimensional (2D) limit while potentially preserving intriguing properties of antiferromagnets, such as insensitivity to external magnetic fields and ultrafast spin dynamics in the THz range. The investigation of the electronic band structure of these materials is crucial to understand their behavior and thus to identify paths for future applications. Here, we investigate the valence band structure of one of the most studied 2D antiferromagnets –iron phosphorus trisulfide (FePS3)– using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and compare our results with first-principles calculations based on Hubbard-corrected density functional theory (DFT+U). This allows us to identify the bands originating respectively from the Fe 3d, the S 3p, and the P 3p orbitals and to describe their dispersion throughout the whole Brillouin zone. Our results represent an important step towards an accurate theoretical description of the electronic properties of transition metal phosphorus trisulfides, which is a pre-requisite for understanding the behavior of antiferromagnetic materials at the 2D limit. © 2023 The Author(s)","2D materials; angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy; antiferromagnetism; layered magnetism; Transition-metal phosphotrichalcogenides","","Plan Gent of Excellence of the Generalitat Valenciana, (CDEIGENT/2019/022, CIDEGENT/2018/004, INST 212/409); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (A08, TRR 142/3); Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER, (CEX2019–000919-M); Universitat de València, 85|86; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (2D-HETEROS PID2020–117152RB-100); Horizon 2020, (964396, ERC-StG-101042680 2D-SMARTiES); Ministerium für Kultur und Wissenschaft des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen, MKW NRW","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the International Collaborative Research centre 160 (Projects B9 and Z4) and the TRR 142/3, Project A08.

Here we show using numerically exact methods that in a driven strongly interacting charge-density-wave insulator a band-like resonance in the gap region is formed. We associate this feature to the so-called Villain mode in quantum-magnetic materials, which originates in moving domain walls induced by the interaction. We do not obtain the in-gap band when driving a non-interacting charge density wave model. In contrast, it appears in the interacting system also in equilibrium at intermediate temperatures and in the short-time evolution of the system after a quantum quench to the lowest-order high-frequency effective Floquet Hamiltonian. Our findings connect the phenomenology of a periodically driven strongly correlated system and its quench dynamics to the finite-temperature dynamical response of quantum-magnetic materials and will be insightful for future investigations of strongly correlated materials in pump-probe setups. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Charge density; Charge density waves; Domain walls; Electron-electron interactions; Hamiltonians; Quantum theory; Band formations; Charge-density-waves; Electron-electron-interactions; Exact methods; Gap regions; Modern time; Moving domain; Quantum magnetics; Time-resolved spectroscopy; Transient state; Magnetic materials","North-German Supercomputing Alliance; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (217133147/SFB 1073, B07)","We thank Götz Uhrig, André Eckardt, Stefan Kehrein, Marin Bukov, Sebastian Paeckel, Thomas Köhler, Mona Kalthoff, Karlo Penc, Niklas Bölter and Karun Gadge for useful discussions.

The Floquet evolution is based on two different elements. The first one is a time-independent or stroboscopic evolution with an effective Hamiltonian corresponding to the quantum simulation target. The second element is the time evolution at the frequencies of the nonresonant driving and of its harmonics, denoted as micromotion. We examine experimentally and theoretically the harmonic dual-dressing Floquet engineering of a cold atomic two-level sample. Our focus is the dressing operation with small bare energies and large Rabi frequencies, where frequencies and amplitudes of the stroboscopic/micromotion time evolutions are comparable. At the kHz range of our dressed atom oscillations, we probe directly both the stroboscopic and micromotion components of the qubit global time evolution. We develop ad-hoc monitoring tools of the Floquet space evolution. The direct record of the time evolution following a pulsed excitation demonstrates the interplay between the two components of the spin precession in the Floquet space. From the resonant pumping of the dressed system at its evolution frequencies, Floquet eigenenergy spectra up to the fifth order harmonic of the dressing frequency are precisely measured as function of dressing parameters. Dirac points of the Floquet eigenenergies are identified and, correspondingly, a jump in the dynamical phase shift is measured. The stroboscopic Hamiltonian eigenfrequencies are measured also from the probe of the micromotion sidebands.These monitoring tools are appropriate for quantum simulation/computation investigations. Our results evidence that the stroboscopic phase shift of the qubit wavefunction contains an additional information that opens new simulation directions. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; cold stress; excitation; oscillation; simulation","Marco Polini; Gruppo Nazionale per la Fisica Matematica, GNFM","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge technical assistance from A.

The optimized compounds reveals that the Lattice constant as well as total energy data of AHfO3 and BAgO3 (A = Cs, Ag; B = Hf, Cs) which was observed to be in the order of CsAgO3 > CsHfO3 > AgHfO3 > HfAgO3, has the influence of cation size and position on the lattice constant. The PDOS plot of AgHfO3 shows that Hf-5p and O-2p orbital make significant contribution to the valence band, whereas the conduction band is formed from the electronic contributions of Ag-4d and O-2p states. For CsHfO3, the PDOS plot reveals that the valence band below the Fermi energy level results from the 5p and 2p electrons of Hf and O atoms, respectively. On the other hand, the major contributions for the conduction band formation are from the 4d – Ag and 2p – O orbitals. Additionally, the dielectric function, refractive index, and extinction coefficient were calculated in the energy range of 1 – 12 eV which shows fascinating optical properties. The structure when modified by hydrogenation to AgHfH3, CsHfH3, CsAgH3, and HfAgH3 showed results suggesting their good hydrogen storage characteristics. The estimated desorption temperature of CsAgH3, HfAgH3, CsHfH3 and AgHfH3 are in the range of 351, 344, 384 and 361 °K respectively while the formation energy was observed to be in the range of −44.995 to −50.277 KJ.mol−1.H2. © 2023 The Author(s)","Cation influence; Crystal rigidity; DFT; Optoelectronics; Perovskite","","","","H.

A spontaneous polarization of ∼134 μC/cm2 was calculated for 37% Mg-doped ZnO along the [0001] direction. The high polarization values of Mg-doped ZnO are due to the local distortion and increased ionicity of the compound along the [0001] direction, accentuated by the structural changes and corresponding bond length modifications that the ZnO structure undergoes.

Here, we report the engineering of band alignment in LaFeO3/LaNiO3 (LFO/LNO) heterostructures via interfacial doping that yields greatly enhanced catalytic performance. The 0.2 eV offset (VBO) between the Fermi level in metallic LNO and the valence band in semiconducting LFO that we predict using density functional theory makes LFO a p-type semiconductor, resulting in significantly lower barriers for hole transport through LFO compared to the intrinsic material. Experimental band alignment measured with in situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of epitaxial LFO/LNO heterostructures confirms these predictions, producing a measured VBO of 0.3(1) eV. Furthermore, OER catalytic measurements on these samples in the alkaline solution show an increase in catalytic current density by a factor of ∼275 compared to LFO grown on n-type Nb-doped SrTiO3. These results demonstrate the power of tuning band alignments through interfacial band engineering for improved catalytic performance of oxides. © 2023 Author(s).","","Alignment; Catalysts; Density functional theory; Electrocatalysis; Heterojunctions; Nickel oxide; Semiconductor doping; Strontium titanates; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Alkaline environment; Band alignments; Catalytic performance; Density-functional-theory; Metallics; Overpotential; P type semiconductor; Perovskite oxides; Precious-metal catalysts; Thin film interfaces; Perovskite","National Science Foundation, NSF; Division of Materials Research, DMR, (NSF-DMR-1809847, NSF-DMR-1848344)","R.P., A.R.B, B.H.F., and R.B.C. acknowledge the support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Materials Research through Grant No. NSF-DMR-1809847.

Large-scale TMDCs grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are now available at continuously improving quality, but native defects and natural degradation in these materials still present significant challenges. Spectral hysteresis in gate-biased photoluminescence (PL) measurements of WSe2 further revealed long-term trapping issues of charge carriers in intrinsic defect states. To address these issues, we apply here a two-step treatment with organic molecules, demonstrating the “healing” of native defects in CVD-grown WSe2 and WS2 by substituting atomic sulfur into chalcogen vacancies. We uncover that the adsorption of thiols provides only partial defect passivation, even for high adsorption quality, and that thiol adsorption is fundamentally limited in eliminating charge traps. However, as soon as the molecular backbone is trimmed and atomic sulfur is released to the crystal, both bonds of the sulfur are recruited to passivate the divalent defect and the semiconductor quality improves drastically. Time-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is applied here together with other methods for the characterization of defects, their healing, leading energies and occupation. First-principles calculations support a unified picture of the electronic passivation of sulfur-healed WSe2 and WS2. This work provides a simple and efficient method for improving the quality of 2D semiconductors and has the potential to impact device performance even after natural degradation. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Adsorption; Chemical vapor deposition; Defect states; Passivation; Selenium compounds; Sulfur; Transition metals; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Chemical vapour deposition; Defect healing; Device application; Dichalcogenides; Large-scales; Native defect; Natural degradation; Recent researches; Scale transition; Two-dimensional; Tungsten compounds","ASCENT; European Research Commission, (101058079); National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Semiconductor Research Corporation, SRC; Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-14-1-0251); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; Basic Energy Sciences, BES, (DE-SC0021984); Stanford SystemX Alliance; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Israel Science Foundation, ISF, (1294/18)","D.N., A.L., R.K.Y., T.H. and T.B. would like to thank the German Science Foundation (DFG) for supporting this work with the DIP grant No.1223-21.

The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction using tin-modified palladium electrode (Sn/Pd) provided a promising alternative for nitrate removal. However, the pH effect on the nitrate reduction activity of Sn/Pd and its mechanistic insights are still unclear. In this study, Sn/Pd(100) single crystalline electrodes were used as a model electrode to understand the pH effect on its nitrate and nitrite reduction activity and mechanism. Sn/Pd(100) electrodes showed the nitrate reduction activity at pH < 3.8. DFT calculations suggest that Sn2+ site can be found on Pd(100) at pH < 3.8 and promote nitrate adsorption. The copresence of Sn and Pd sites can reduce the LUMO energy of the adsorbed nitrate molecule and decrease the van der Waals electrostatic potential of the O-N bond, which promotes electron injection and protonation to nitrate. At pH > 3.8, on the other hand, the formation of Sn(OH)+ or Sn(OH)2 can inhibit the adsorption of NO3− on Sn atoms, resulting in the disappearance of the electrocatalytic activity. Sn atomic sites mainly promote the reduction step of NO3− → NO2−, and the subsequent NO2– reduction reaction occurs on Pd sites. The protonation of NO2– was crucial to the nitrite reduction on Pd(100) surface. The findings in this study would be useful to develop highly active electrocatalysts based on Sn and Pd materials for the nitrate reduction. © 2023","Effect of nitrite protonation; Effect of tin structures; Electrocatalysis; Nitrate reduction; Tin-modified palladium(100)","Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Potable water; Van der Waals forces; Effect of nitrite protonation; Effect of tin structure; Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction; Nitrate reduction; Nitrite reduction; PH dependence; pH-dependence; Protonations; Reduction activity; Tin-modified palladium(100); Protonation","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP16K20882, JP19H02664, JP21K05124); China Scholarship Council, CSC; Hokkaido University, HU","The authors thank Takao Ohta (Graduate School of Engineering, Hokkaido University), Katsuhisa Ishikawa and Takahiko Hasegawa (Technical Division, Institute for Catalysis, Hokkaido University) for their technical support on electrochemical glassware.

An attractive approach for implementing these operations is to couple these resonators via a nonlinear converter and actuate parametric processes with RF drives. It can be challenging to make these processes simultaneously fast and high fidelity, since this requires introducing strong drives without activating parasitic processes or introducing additional decoherence channels. We show that in addition to a careful management of drive frequencies and the spectrum of environmental noise, leveraging the inbuilt symmetries of the converter Hamiltonian can suppress unwanted nonlinear interactions, preventing converter-induced decoherence. We demonstrate these principles using a differentially-driven DC-SQUID as our converter, coupled to two high-Q microwave cavities. Using this architecture, we engineer a highly-coherent beamsplitter and fast (~100 ns) swaps between the cavities, limited primarily by their intrinsic single-photon loss. We characterize this beamsplitter in the cavities’ joint single-photon subspace, and show that we can detect and post-select photon loss events to achieve a beamsplitter gate fidelity exceeding 99.98%, which to our knowledge far surpasses the current state of the art. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","microwave radiation; noise; nonlinearity; quantum mechanics; spectrum; article; microwave radiation; noise; nonhuman; parity; photon; squid","Yale Institute for Nanoscience and Quantum Engineering; Yale SEAS Cleanroom; Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-16-1-0349, W911NF-18-1-0212, W911NF-22-1-0053); Government of South Australia","Funding text 1: We thank J.

Due to the direct relationship between capacitance and electronic states around the Fermi level, structures' electronic properties were evaluated by DOS plots. The results of integrated specific quantum capacitance in the range of water stability potential show an improvement of capacity in each p and n-type doping. The calculated cohesive energies of doped structures reflect the stability enhancement. Also, the stability/capacitance of single and double vacancies in two distinct positions (sp and sp2) were examined. The results illustrate stability retention and quantum capacitance improvement of these defective structures. Among the doped structures, the maximum quantum capacitance is 2251.10 F/gr belonging to the aluminum doped structure (in the sp position). For the defective structures, the maximum quantum capacitance is 4221.69 F/gr belonging to removing two sp carbon atoms. These quantum capacitances significantly improved compared to the pristine structure (1216.87 F/gr) and many other structures. These stunning results can contribute to the design of appropriate structures as electrode materials for high-efficiency supercapacitors. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","","","M.

We elucidate the ironation mechanism of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) for suitable cathode material for iron battery application. The layer structures of V2O5 favours the intercalation of electrode materials due to enough interstitial voids and it is also a low cost high safety material with high specific capacity and energy density. Because of these benefits its becoming a subject of increasing interest for the researcher in the field of battery application. It has been observed that the suitable amount of cation doping in V2O5 increases the electrical conductivity as well as electrochemical performance. The structure of the material is very important during cycling in the battery and there is a correlation between structural evolution and performance of the battery. In this context two reaction pathways are proposed, based on our first-principles calculation to support the possible explanation for the features of experimental observations. While one of the pathways retains the crystalline structure, the other pathway shows the degradation of material with amorphous structure. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Energy storage; First-principles calculation; Iron-battery; Ironation mechanism","Cathodes; Energy storage; Secondary batteries; Vanadium pentoxide; Battery applications; Cathodes material; Economic environment; Environment friendly; First principle calculations; Iron-battery; Ironation mechanism; Layer structures; Sustainable energy; Vanadium pentoxide; Iron","","","K.P.S.S.

Results showed that the materials are chemically stable with optimized lattice constants found to be 5.26 Å, 5.54 Å, and 5.92 Å for TlGeCl3, TlGeBr3, and TlGeI3, respectively. The materials are direct (R→R) semiconductors with bandgaps of 0.794 eV, 0.522 eV, and 0.419 eV, for the respective compounds using the GGA-PBE functional while the corresponding values of the bandgaps using the HSE06 approximation are 1.027 eV, 0.865 eV, and 0.436 eV, respectively. In addition, they are all predicted to be mechanically stable and ductile in nature according to Born stability criteria and Poisson ratio, respectively. The perovskites also possess high absorption and conductivity as well as low reflectivity, strongly indicating their potential applications in optoelectronics including photovoltaic.

Although surface modification with organophosphonic acids (PAs) with an alkyl or aminoalkyl functional group on TiO2 has been investigated previously, knowledge of the synthesis-properties correlation (e.g. the binding mode of the PAs) is still lacking, especially for functional group-surface interactions. These are however important as they can influence functional group availability in applications such as (metal) sorption. In this work, the dependence of modification degree and phosphorus chemical environment on pH and chain length (C1 to C6) was investigated with TGA, ICP-OES, nitrogen/argon sorption, XPS, and solid-state 31P NMR and DFT calculations. The TGA and the ICP-OES results showed a clear impact of pH on surface modification degrees, with a different response for modification with alkyl- and aminoalkylphosphonic acids, featuring a more rapid decrease in modification degrees from pH 2 upwards for the alkylphosphonic acids compared to the aminoalkylphosphonic acids. Moreover, a clear correlation can be found between the aminoalkyl chain length and the NH2/NH3+ ratio. In addition, a positive correlation between the modification degree and the protonation degree of the amine group is observed for aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid (2AEPA) modified samples, while this is absent for longer alkyl chains. This is supported by DFT calculations that indicate that the most stable binding modes of AMPA and 2AEPA grafted on the anatase (1 0 1) surface include hydrogen bonds between NH3+ and the surface oxygen atoms, in contrast, the most stable binding modes for 3-aminopropylphosphonic acid (3APPA), 4-aminobutylphosphonic acid (4ABPA), and 6-aminohexylphosphonic acid (6AHPA) grafted on the anatase (1 0 1) surface involve a Lewis acid-base interaction between NH2 and a surface Ti site. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","(amino)alkylphosphonic acids; Hydrocarbon chain length; NH<sub>2</sub>/NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> ratio; pH; TiO<sub>2</sub> surface modification","Binding energy; Chain length; Chemical modification; Chemical stability; Density functional theory; Grafting (chemical); Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen bonds; Mechanical stability; pH; (amino)alkylphosphonic acid; Alkylphosphonic acids; Binding modes; Hydrocarbon chain length; Modification degrees; NH2/NH3+ ratio; Organophosphonic acids; Surface interactions; Surface-modification; TiO2 surface modification; Titanium dioxide","Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO; Vlaamse Instelling voor Technologisch Onderzoek, VITO; Universiteit Antwerpen; Universiteit Hasselt, (AUHL/15/2-GOH3816N); Vlaamse regering, (I006220N, K801621N); Herculesstichting","R.

In this work, we use quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and density functional theory with Hubbard U (DFT + U) calculations to examine the electronic structure of TbMn6Sn6. To do so, we optimize accurate, correlation-consistent pseudopotentials for Tb and Sn using coupled-cluster and configuration–interaction (CI) methods. We find that DFT + U and single-reference QMC calculations suffer from the same overestimation of the magnetic moments as meta-GGA and hybrid density functional approximations. Our findings point to the need for improved orbitals/wavefunctions for this class of materials, such as natural orbitals from CI, or for the inclusion of multi-reference effects that capture the static correlations for an accurate prediction of magnetic properties. DFT + U with Mn magnetic moments adjusted to the experiment predict the Dirac crossing in bulk to be close to the Fermi level, within ~120 meV, in agreement with the experiments. Our non-stoichiometric slab calculations show that the Dirac crossing approaches even closer to the Fermi level, suggesting the possible realization of Chern magnetism in this limit. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","DOE Public Access Plan; Texas Advanced Computing Center; National Science Foundation, NSF, (OAC-1818253); U.S. Department of Defense, DOD, (FA9550-23-1-0498); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; Office of Science, SC, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); Basic Energy Sciences, BES; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, LBNL, (DE-AC02-05CH11231); University of Texas at Austin, UT; Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering, DMSE","Funding text 1: This work has been supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences, and Engineering Division, as part of the Computational Materials Sciences Program and Center for Predictive Simulation of Functional Materials.

In this study, a simple hydrothermal process is used to manufacture carbonized polymer dots/ZnIn2S4 (CPDs/ZIS) heterostructure, which enhances the light absorption and charge carrier lifetime in comparison to bare ZnIn2S4 (ZIS). Upon irradiation with visible light, the 3-CPDs/ZIS composite generates hydrogen at a rate of 133 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 8.9 times faster than that of pure ZIS. The addition of CPDs can increase the range of light that can be absorbed, extend the service life of the optical charge, increase the specific surface area, and promote charge separation and transmission, which could effectively accelerate the photocatalytic reduction reaction. The presence of CPDs results in the introduction of multiple transition energy states and a decrease in the H* adsorption free energy, which enhances the hydrogen evolution activity according to the theoretical calculation findings of density functional theory (DFT) and Gibbs free energy of the hydrogen evolution process. Combining theoretical calculations and experimental results, a direct Z-type heterojunction mechanism is proposed for the hydrogen evolution promotion effectiveness of CPDs/ZIS under visible light. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","CPDs; DFT calculation; Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution; Z-scheme heterojunction; ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>","Carrier lifetime; Density functional theory; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Indium compounds; Light absorption; Photocatalytic activity; Zinc compounds; hydrogen; indium; microsphere; polymer; sulfur; zinc; CPD; Density-functional theory calculations; Hydrogen-evolution; Performance; Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution; Polymer dots; Theoretical calculations; Visible light; Visible-light-driven; Z-scheme heterojunction; absorption; adsorption; Article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; density functional theory; energy; hydrogen evolution; irradiation; light; optics; photocatalysis; reduction (chemistry); surface area; Heterojunctions","Yancheng Institute of Technology's Analysis & Testing Center; Yancheng Institute of Technology, YCIT, (KYCX22_XZ001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (21403184, 51772258); Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China, (22KJA430008); Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province of China","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 21403184 and 51772258), the Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province, the Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (Grant no. 22KJA430008), Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Yancheng Institute of Technology (KYCX22_XZ001).

Most importantly, properties of the absorber layer such as the band gap, electronic, optical, chemical composition and the grain size of the perovskite absorbed layer are very sacrosanct when determining efficacy of the material for such application. Thus, in this work, the optical, structural stability, electronic, and mechanical properties of non-halide cubic perovskite CsXO3 (X = Mg, Be and Ca) was extensively studied using the first principles Density functional theory (DFT) approach. The structural, electronic and optoelectronic properties was evaluated using Quantum Espresso Simulation Package (QESP) with the plane wave self-consistent field (PWscf) code. The structural computation reveals that the Lattice constant as well as total energy of CsXO3 (X = Be, Mg and Ca) increases as the size of cation X (X = Be, Mg and Ca) increases such that CsCaO3 possess the highest energy. Contrary, the fermi energy decreases with increase in cationic size, however, CsCaO3 has the highest lattice constant value 4.3743 eV. Electronic properties investigation shows that the studied perovskite has a metallic property with no forbidden band. zero band gap materials can adsorb photon across the entire solar spectrum, including lower-energy photons which is an advantage over a non-zero band gap which can only absorb photon with energies higher than the band gap energy can be absorbed and converted into electricity. This enables more efficient utilization of sunlight and increased overall energy conversion. To ascertain the effect of atomic exchange and orbital contribution in the formation of electronic properties, partial density of state (PDOS) was calculated and the result reveal that electron transition occurs mostly from p-orbital oxygen atom having major contribution on the valence band to the d-orbital of Caesium atom having major contribution on the conduction band and X-cation having minor contribution. CsXO3 (X = Be, Mg and Ca) also shows fascinating optical properties and thus can be used to improve solar cell device. © 2023 The Authors","ABO<sub>3</sub> perovskites; DFT; Electronic; Optical; Structural","","","","H.

Through the use of the first-principles density functional theory (FP-DFT), we thoroughly analyze the impact of strain-induced structural, electronic and optical properties of Sr3AsCl3. At Γ point, the unstrained Sr3AsCl3 compound exhibits a direct bandgap of 1.649 eV/2.473 eV for PBE/HSE. When the relativistic spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effect is accounted for, the bandgap of the Sr3AsCl3 compound is reduced to 1.589 eV/2.41 eV for PBE/HSE. Besides, the bandgap of Sr3AsCl3 exhibits a decreasing trend under compressive strain and an increasing trend under tensile strain. The photon energy spectrum shows a blue shift in the absorption-coefficient, electron loss function, and dielectric function under compressive strain, while a red shift is observed under tensile strain. Dielectric constant of Sr3AsCl3's spikes are found to shift toward lesser photon energy under growing compressive strain (red-shift), while shifting toward upper photon energy under growing tensile strain (blue-shift). Consequently, the Sr3AsCl3 compound is particularly well suited for use in solar cells for energy generation and light control. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Electronic properties; Optical properties; Optoelectronic device; Photovoltaic cell; Spin-orbit coupling effect; Strain engineering","Absorption spectroscopy; Blue shift; Cell culture; Cell engineering; Chlorine compounds; Density functional theory; Energy gap; Optoelectronic devices; Perovskite; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photons; Red Shift; Solar cells; Blue shift; Compressive strain; Cubic materials; Electronic and optical properties; Inorganics; Optoelectronics devices; Photon energy; Solar industries; Spin-orbit coupling effects; Strain engineering; Electronic properties","Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, PNU, (PNURSP2023R29)","The authors extend their sincere appreciation to the Researchers Supported by the Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project number ( PNURSP2023R29 ), Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia .","M.F.

The resulting formulation, based on the Green-Kubo linear response or the Wigner-transport equation, bridges this model for glasses with the traditional Boltzmann kinetic approach for crystals. The computational effort required by these methods usually scales as the cube of the number of atoms, thus severely limiting the size range of computationally affordable glass models. Leveraging hydrodynamic arguments, we show how this issue can be overcome through a simple formula to extrapolate a reliable estimate of the bulk thermal conductivity of glasses from finite models of moderate size. We showcase our findings for realistic models of paradigmatic glassy materials. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Atoms; Boltzmann equation; Computation theory; Hydrodynamics; Thermal conductivity; Amorphous solids; Boltzmann kinetic approaches; Computational effort; Finite size scaling; Glass models; Green-Kubo; Linear response; Size ranges; Thermal transport; Transport equation; Glass","Italian Ministry of Research and Education; National Centre, (CN00000013); European Commission, EC, (10109337); Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (2017KFY7XF)","The authors thank E.

In this paper, we lift the constraint and derive a previously unknown quantum Cramér-Rao bound.

The significant wavefunction size of these highly-excited states (proportional to n2) enables strong long-range dipole-dipole (proportional to n4) and van der Waals interactions (proportional to n11). Currently, the highest-lying Rydberg states are found in naturally occurring Cu 2O . However, for technological applications, the ability to grow high-quality synthetic samples is essential. The fabrication of thin-film Cu 2O samples is of particular interest as they hold potential for observing extreme single-photon nonlinearities through the Rydberg blockade. Nevertheless, due to the susceptibility of high-lying states to charged impurities, growing synthetic samples of sufficient quality poses a substantial challenge. This study successfully demonstrates the CMOS-compatible synthesis of a Cu 2O thin film on a transparent substrate that showcases Rydberg excitons up to n= 8 which is readily suitable for photonic device fabrications.

Rationally engineering the favorable properties of polaritons is critically required for the rapidly growing research. Here, we demonstrate the manipulation of nonlinear polaritons with the lithographically defined potential landscapes in monolayer WS2 microcavities. The discretization of photoluminescence dispersions and spatially confined patterns indicate the deterministic on-site localization of polaritons by the artificial mesa cavities. Varying the trapping sizes, the polariton-reservoir interaction strength is enhanced by about six times through managing the polariton–exciton spatial overlap. Meanwhile, the coherence of trapped polaritons is significantly improved due to the spectral narrowing and tailored in a picosecond range. Therefore, our work not only offers a convenient approach to manipulating the nonlinearity and coherence of polaritons but also opens up possibilities for exploring many-body phenomena and developing novel polaritonic devices based on 2D materials. © 2023, Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics (CIOMP), CAS.","","Excitons; Microcavities; Optoelectronic devices; Phonons; Photons; Transition metals; Tungsten compounds; Ambient conditions; Artificial potentials; Deterministics; Discretizations; Exciton-polariton; Optoelectronics devices; Polaritons; Property; Thin semiconductor; Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD); Polariton","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12020101003, 12250710126); Tsinghua University, THU; State Key Laboratory of Low-Dimensional Quantum Physics, SKLLDQP","Q.X. gratefully acknowledges the following funding sources: National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 12020101003, and 12250710126), funding support from the State Key Laboratory of Low-Dimensional Quantum Physics of Tsinghua University and the Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program.

However, self-diffusion is very poorly known on this material, and also the few impurity diffusion studies, devoted in particular to helium and lithium, overlook the possible diffusion coupling with intrinsic defects. In this paper we present a study of boron self-diffusion in boron carbide based on first principles calculations and kinetic cluster expansion. Our results show that boron self-diffusion may occur with a migration activation energy on the order of 1.5–1.6 eV and with a global activation energy between 4 and 5.5 eV, depending on the doping conditions, which is significantly lower than the self-diffusion activation energies in other semiconducting carbides, like silicon carbide. We believe that our results are of interest for many applications of boron carbide and for tuning the best conditions for controlling the synthesis routes at specific stoichiometries for boron carbide. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS","Boron carbide; DFT; Diffusion; First principles; Point defects","Activation energy; Boron carbide; Diffusion; Silicon carbide; Wide band gap semiconductors; Condition; DFT; Diffusion coupling; Diffusion studies; First principles; Functional properties; High temperature materials; Impurity diffusion; Interstitials; Self-diffusions; Point defects","IDRIS, (2021-A0110906018, 2022-A0130906018); National Centre for Scientific Research.The CNRS; TGCC; Grand Équipement National De Calcul Intensif, GENCI","The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Guido Roma reports financial support was provided by National Centre for Scientific Research.The CNRS NEEDS programme is gratefully aknowledged for funding of the project CIAN, in the framework of which this work was partially carried on.

We here reveal such an interference pattern in phase space, which underlies but goes beyond Zitterbewegung, and whose nonclassicality is manifested by the negativity of the phase space quasiprobability distribution, and the associated pseudospin-momentum entanglement. We confirm this discovery by numerical simulation and an on-chip experiment, where a superconducting qubit and a quantized microwave field respectively emulate the internal and external degrees of freedom of a Dirac particle. The measured quasiprobability negativities agree well with the numerical simulation. Besides being of fundamental importance, the demonstrated nonclassical effects are useful in quantum technology. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Numerical models; Phase space methods; Quantum entanglement; Classical systems; Dirac particles; In-phase; Interference patterns; Nonclassicality; Phase spaces; Quantum interference; Quasiprobability distributions; Relativistic quantum mechanics; Zitterbewegung; Degrees of freedom (mechanics)","Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0300200); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11875108, 11934018, 12204105, 12274080, 92065114, T2121001); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDB28000000); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (Z200009); Fuzhou University, FZU, (049050011050, JG202001-2); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B0303030001); Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Fujian Province, (2020J06011)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 12274080, No. 11875108, No. 12204105, No. 11934018, No. 92065114, and No. T2121001), Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology (Grant No. 2021ZD0300200), the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDB28000000), the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province, China (Gran No. 2020B0303030001), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. Z200009), the Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar of Fujian Province under Grant 2020J06011, and Project from Fuzhou University under Grants No. JG202001-2 and No. 049050011050.

Despite their importance in both fundamental research and applications, SCTMs are very rare in nature. Here, we propose a strategy to design SCTMs by intercalating the superconducting units into the topological insulators. A program that characterizes the superconducting BdG Chern number of 2D BdG Hamiltonian from ab initio calculations is also developed. Following this strategy, PdBi2Te5 and PdBi2Te4 are found to be experimentally synthesizable and ideal SCTMs. Chiral TSC could be realized in such SCTMs by incorporating topological surface states with Zeeman effect, which can be realized by an external magnetic field or in proximity to ferromagnetic insulator. Our strategy provides a new method for identifying the SCTMs and TSC candidates, and the program makes it possible to design and modulate the TSC candidates from ab initio calculations. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Bismuth compounds; Quantum computers; Tellurium compounds; Ab initio; Ab initio calculations; Chern numbers; External magnetic field; Ferromagnetic insulator; Fundamental research; Majorana; Research and application; Topological insulators; Zeeman effect; Topology","Princeton University’s Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, (DMR-2011750, DMR-2141966); National Science Foundation, NSF; Alfred P.

In the context of materials science, an important open problem is the computational description of chemical reactions on surfaces. In this work, we outline a workflow to model the adsorption and reaction of molecules on surfaces using quantum computing algorithms. We develop and compare two local embedding methods for the systematic determination of active spaces. These methods are automated and based on the physics of molecule-surface interactions and yield systematically improvable active spaces. Furthermore, to reduce the quantum resources required for the simulation of the selected active spaces using quantum algorithms, we introduce a technique for exact and automated circuit simplification. This technique is applicable to a broad class of quantum circuits and critical to enable demonstration on near-term quantum devices. We apply the proposed combination of active-space selection and circuit simplification to the dissociation of water on a magnesium surface using classical simulators and quantum hardware. Our study identifies reactions of molecules on surfaces, in conjunction with the proposed algorithmic workflow, as a promising research direction in the field of quantum computing applied to materials science. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Embeddings; Molecules; Quantum theory; Surface reactions; Active spaces; Adsorption and reactions; Computing algorithms; Electronics system; Embedding method; Embeddings; Material science; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Work-flows; Quantum computers","","","T.P.

The study employs self-consistent atomistic simulations and the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. Initially, the optimal underlap length for the GNR-FET by device has been determined evaluating the ON-current (ION) to OFF-current (IOFF) ratio, which is a critical parameter for digital applications. Subsequently, the impact of underlap engineering on analog/RF performance metrics has been analyzed and conducting a comprehensive trade-off analysis considering parameters such as intrinsic-gain, transistor efficiency, and device cut-off frequency. The results demonstrate that the device incorporating the underlap mechanism exhibits superior performance in terms of the ION /IOFF ratio, transconductance generation factor (TGF), output resistance (r0), intrinsic gain (gm r0), gain frequency product (GFP), and gain transfer frequency product (GTFP). However, the device without the underlap effect demonstrates the highest transconductance (gm) and cut-off frequency (fT). Finally, a linearity analysis has been conducted to compare the optimized GNR-FET device with the conventional GNR-FET device without the underlap effect. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","","","M.A. Ahmad; Department of Electronics Engineering, IIT Dhanbad, Dhanbad, 826004, India; email: akram14407@gmail.com","","Nature Research","20452322","","","37620403","English","Sci.

While experimental observations have confirmed the existence of discrete or continuous time crystals, these realizations have relied on the utilization of periodic forces or effective modulation through cavity feedback. The original proposal for time crystals is that they would represent self-sustained motions without any external periodicity, but realizing such purely self-generated behavior has not yet been achieved. Here, we provide theoretical and experimental evidence that many-body interactions can give rise to an inherent time crystalline phase. Following a calculation that shows an ensemble of pumped four-level atoms can spontaneously break continuous time translation symmetry, we observe periodic motions in an erbium-doped solid. The inherent time crystal produced by our experiment is self-protected by many-body interactions and has a measured coherence time beyond that of individual erbium ions. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","asymmetry; cavity; crystal structure; experimental study","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12174026, 62105033)","The authors would like to thank Zhang-Qi Yin for helpful discussions.

The evolutions of the strain-dependent band gap are obtained using the numerical calculations within the tight-binding (TB) model as well as the first-principles (DFT) simulations and compared with previous findings. The TB-model-based findings show that the band gap of the strain-free phosphorene agrees with the experimental value and linearly depends on both stretching and shearing: increases (decreases) as the stretching increases (decreases), whereas gradually decreases with increasing the shear. A linear dependence is less or more similar as compared to that obtained from the ab initio simulations for shear strain, however disagrees with a non-monotonic behaviour from the DFT-based calculations for tensile strain. Possible reasons for the discrepancy are discussed. In case of a combined deformation, when both strain types (tensile/compression + shear) are loaded simultaneously, their mutual influence extends the realizable band gap range: from zero up to the values respective to the wide-band-gap semiconductors. At a switched-on combined strain, the semiconductor–semimetal phase transition in the phosphorene is reachable at a weaker (strictly non-destructive) strain, which contributes to progress in fundamental and breakthroughs. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, NASU, (0120U102265, 0122U002396)","The first author acknowledges the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine for support within the framework of the program of post-doctoral research in the N.A.S. of Ukraine for 2021–2023 through the project “Complex diagnostics of sensitive to strains and defects structural and electronic properties of metallic nanomaterials” (state reg.

In this scenario, innovative materials for photovoltaic and thermoelectric device applications are required by addressing current issues of instability and efficiency. Perovskites are very popular in this regard particularly having higher power conversion efficiency of 25.2% in the case of solar cells. In the current article, we investigated innovative small direct band gap double perovskites (elapsolite) Cs2AgTlX6 (X = Cl, Br) with a comprehensive discussion on structural, electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties using a first-principles approach. The compounds under investigation are found stable, efficient, and economical with alluring optical and thermoelectric properties. The higher absorption peaks in the visible range, substantial optical conductivities (∼1016sec-1), and a lower percentage of reflection in the visible range makes these compounds fascinating for solar cell applications. Whereas large values of Seebeck coefficients, electrical conductivities, the figure of merits (greater than unity), and small values of thermal conductivities suggest the applications of these compounds in thermoelectric generators. © 2023","Density functional theory (DFT); Perovskite solar cells; Small band gap double perovskites; The figure of merit (ZT); Thermoelectric properties","Computation theory; Conversion efficiency; Design for testability; Energy gap; Fossil fuels; Perovskite; Perovskite solar cells; Silver; Thallium; Thermal conductivity; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; 'current; Density functional theory; Density-functional-theory; Direct band gap; Double perovskites; Optical-; Small band gap double perovskite; The figure of merit (ZT); Thermoelectric properties; Visible range; Density functional theory","Centre for High-Performance Computing, (CHPC-MATS1424, RSP2023R71); King Saud University, KSU","The authors acknowledge the computing resources provided by the Centre for High-Performance Computing (CHPC-MATS1424), Cape Town, South Africa.

This review presents models that classify states against pairwise particle states |ij〉, given their state transition (ST) probability P|ij〉. A quantum AI (QAI) program, weighs and compares the field's distance between entangled states as qubits from their scalar field of radius R≥|rij|. These states distribute across 〈R〉 with expected probability 〈Pdistribute〉 and measurement outcome 〈M(Pdistribute)〉=P|ij〉. A quantum-classical hybrid model of processors via QAI, classifies and predicts states by decoding qubits into classical bits. For example, a QDF as a quantum field computation model (QFCM) in IBM-QE, performs the doubling of P|ij〉 for a strong state prediction outcome. QFCMs are compared to achieve a universal QFCM (UQFCM). This model is novel in making strong event predictions by simulating systems on any scale using QAI. Its expected measurement fidelity is 〈M(F)〉≥7/5 in classifying states to select 7 optimal QFCMs to predict 〈M〉’s on QFTh observables. This includes QFCMs’ commonality of 〈M〉 against QFCMs limitations in predicting system events. Common measurement results of QFCMs include their expected success probability 〈Psuccess〉 over STs occurring in the system. Consistent results with high F's, are averaged over STs as 〈Pdistribute〉yielding 〈Psuccess〉≥2/3 performed by an SF or QDF of certain QFCMs. A combination of QFCMs with this fidelity level predicts error rates (uncertainties) in measurements, by which a P|ij〉=〈Psuccess〉[Formula presented]1 is weighed as a QAI output to a QFCM user. The user then decides which QFCMs perform a more efficient system simulation as a reliable solution. A UQFCM is useful in predicting system states by preserving and recovering information for intelligent decision support systems in applied, physical, legal and decision sciences, including industry 4.0 systems. © 2023 The Author(s)","Quantum artificial intelligence (QAI); Quantum field computation model (QFCM); Quantum field theory (QFTh); Quantum Fourier transform (QFT); Quantum simulator; Qubit; Success probability; Transition probability; Universal QFCM","","University of Victoria, UVic, (2015-2023, V00766282)","This work was supported by the University of Victoria , Canada, for financial support, award no.

While claims of quantum speed-up have been announced for gate-based quantum computers and photon-based boson samplers, demonstration of an advantage by adiabatic quantum annealers (AQAs) is open. Here we quantify the computational cost and the performance of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), a widely investigated machine learning model, by classical and quantum annealing. Despite the lower computational complexity of the quantum RBM being lost due to physical implementation overheads, a quantum speed-up may arise as a reduction by orders of magnitude of the computational time. By employing real-world cybersecurity datasets, we observe that the negative phase on sufficiently challenging tasks is computed up to 64 times faster by AQAs during the exploitation phase. Therefore, although a quantum speed-up highly depends on the problem’s characteristics, it emerges in existing hardware on real-world data. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Anomaly detection; Qubits; Anomaly detection; Computational costs; Detection speed; Hard task; Machine-learning; Quanta computers; Quantum machines; Real-world; Restricted boltzmann machine; Speed up; Machine learning","CINECA; Vista Technology SRL, (PSR2021DIP008)","Funding text 1: This research has been partially funded by Vista Technology SRL.

Superlattice architectures, with alternating nm-thick layers of typically softer/stiffer materials, have been proven powerful method to improve the mechanical performance of, e.g., cubic transition metal nitride ceramics. Using high-throughput first-principles calculations, we propose that superlattice structures hold promise also for enhancing mechanical properties and fracture resistance of transition metal diborides with two competing hexagonal phases, α and ω . We study 264 possible combinations of α/ α , α/ ω or ω/ ω MB 2 (where M = Al or group 3–6 transition metal) diboride superlattices. Based on energetic stability considerations, together with restrictions for lattice and shear modulus mismatch (Δ a< 4 % , Δ G> 40 GPa), we select 33 superlattice systems for further investigations. The identified systems are analysed in terms of mechanical stability and elastic constants, Cij , where the latter provide indication of in-plane vs. out-of-plane strength (C11 , C33) and ductility (C13- C44 , C12- C66). The superlattice ability to resist brittle cleavage along interfaces is estimated by Griffith’s formula for fracture toughness. The α/ α -type TiB 2 /MB 2 (M = Mo, W), HfB 2 /WB 2 , VB 2 /MB 2 (M = Cr, Mo), NbB 2 /MB 2 (M = Mo, W), and α/ ω -type AlB 2 /MB 2 (M = Nb, Ta, Mo, W), are suggested as the most promising candidates providing atomic-scale basis for enhanced toughness and resistance to crack growth. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Competence Center Functional Nanoscale Materials; VINNOVA, (2018-05973, 2022-03071, 2022-06725); Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (T30801); Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (VR-2021-04426); Agentúra na Podporu Výskumu a Vývoja, APVV, (APVV-21-0042); Vedecká Grantová Agentúra MŠVVaŠ SR a SAV, VEGA, (ITMS 313011AUH4, VEGA 1/0296/22)","TF and MM acknowledge to the Slovak Research and Development Agency (Grant No. APVV-21-0042), Scientific Grant Agency (Grant No. VEGA 1/0296/22), and Operational Program Integrated Infrastructure (Project No. ITMS 313011AUH4).

Here we show using determinantal quantum Monte Carlo and an exactly solvable strongly interacting model that these topological states now shift to quarter filling. A topological Mott insulator is the underlying cause. The peak in the spin susceptibility is consistent with a possible ferromagnetic state at T = 0. The onset of such magnetism would convert the quantum spin Hall to a quantum anomalous Hall effect. While such a symmetry-broken phase typically is accompanied by a gap, we find that the interaction strength must exceed a critical value for this to occur. Hence, we predict that topology can obtain in a gapless phase but only in the presence of interactions in dispersive bands. These results explain the recent quarter-filled quantum anomalous Hall effects seen in moiré systems. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","numerical model; quantum mechanics; symmetry; topology; article; critical value; magnetism","National Science Foundation, NSF, (ACI-1548562, ACI-154856290, DMR-2111379); Energy Frontier Research Centers, EFRCs, (DE-SC0021238)","Funding text 1: We thank Taylor L.

The two dominant phases in the diagram are the quantum spin-liquid (QSL) and the antiferromagnetic Ising order. Quantum correlations suggest that the QSL phase is likely to exhibit entanglement. To explore this possibility, we utilized numerical Lanczos and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to calculate concurrence, quantum discord (QD), and entanglement entropy. The results of our study indicate the existence of quantum entanglement within the intermediate region, implying a greater probability for the dominance of the quantum spin-liquid (QSL) phase over the antiferromagnetic Ising order. This discovery underscores the importance of considering quantum correlations in comprehending the model’s behavior and provides insight into the complex nature of quantum systems. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; entropy; probability","","","S.

It adopts a nonsymmorphic lattice with a-glide symmetry (noncentrosymmetric space group Ama2). The electrical and thermal transport properties were characterized by electrical resistivity, Seebeck effect and thermal conductivity (κ). W3Si2P shows metallic conduction following the Bloch-Grüneisen-Mott model with holes as the main carriers, which is also supported by ab-initio calculations. Electronic and lattice κ make comparable contributions to the thermal conduction at high temperatures, while the electronic component dominates at low temperatures. Electronic-structure calculations reveal that the W 5d orbits govern the bands near the Fermi level, in which 5dx orbital electrons take the maximal occupation. As the first genuine ternary compound in W–Si–P family, it might be a novelty playground to probe the underlying electronic physics related to crystallographic symmetry. A tabulation summarizes the compounds in W–Si–P system, and reviews on their structural and physical properties were made to build a comprehensive understanding of this system. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Band structures; Crystal structure; Electrical resistivity; Silicophosphide; Thermal conductivity","Crystal structure; Electric conductivity; Electronic structure; Phosphorus compounds; Silicon; Silicon compounds; Tungsten compounds; Constituent elements; Crystals structures; Electrical resistivity; Electrical transport properties; Electronic.structure; Isoelectronics; Isostructural; Noncentrosymmetric space groups; Silicophosphide; Thermal transport properties; Thermal conductivity","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11774402, 12074414); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDB25000000); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFA0704200, 2021YFA1401800)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 12074414 and 11774402 ), the National Key Research and Development of China (Grant Nos. 2018YFA0704200 and 2021YFA1401800 ), and the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDB25000000 ).","M.

Rydberg atom arrays constitute one of the most rapidly developing arenas for quantum simulation and quantum computing. The Z2 LGT and topological order has been realized in experiments while the U(1) LGT is being worked hard on the way. States of LGT have local constraints and are fragmented into several winding sectors with topological protection. It is therefore difficult to reach the ground state in target sector for experiments, and it is also an important task for quantum topological memory. Here, we propose a protocol of sweeping quantum annealing (SQA) for searching the ground state among topological sectors. With the quantum Monte Carlo method, we show that this SQA has linear time complexity of size with applications to the antiferromagnetic transverse field Ising model, which has emergent U(1) gauge fields. This SQA protocol can be realized easily on quantum simulation platforms such as Rydberg array and D-wave annealer. We expect this approach would provide an efficient recipe for resolving the topological hindrances in quantum optimization and the preparation of quantum topological state. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Ising model; Monte Carlo methods; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Simulation platform; Topology; Atom arrays; Lattice gauge theory; Quantum annealing; Quantum device; Quantum optimization; Quantum simulations; Quantum simulators; Rydberg atoms; Simulation computing; Theory model; Ground state","Beijing PARATERA Tech Co., Ltd.; RGC; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR of China, (17301420, 17301721, 17309822, AoE/P-701/20); Westlake University; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (A_HKU703/22); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11874094, 12104098, 12274046); Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LZ23A040003); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing Municipality, (CSTB2022NSCQ-JQX0018); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2021CDJZYJH-003)","Funding text 1: We especially acknowledge Xiaopeng Li for useful discussions and suggestions.

Photonic coupled cavity arrays are a promising alternative platform for realizing such simulators, due to their potential for scalability, small size, and high-temperature operability. However, programmability and nonlinearity in photonic cavities remain outstanding challenges. Here, using a silicon photonic coupled cavity array made up of 8 high quality factor (Q up to ~7.1×104) resonators and equipped with specially designed thermo-optic island heaters for independent control of cavities, we demonstrate a programmable photonic cavity array in the telecom regime, implementing tight-binding Hamiltonians with access to the full eigenenergy spectrum. We report a ~ 50 % reduction in the thermal crosstalk between neighboring sites of the cavity array compared to traditional heaters, and then present a control scheme to program the cavity array to a given tight-binding Hamiltonian. The ability to independently program high-Q photonic cavities, along with the compatibility of silicon photonics to high volume manufacturing opens new opportunities for scalable quantum simulation using telecom regime infrared photons. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","silicon; array; equipment; nonlinearity; silicon; simulation; Article; controlled study; electric potential; high temperature; infrared radiation; nonlinear system; photon; photonics; prediction; prediction error; quantum chemistry; quantum optics; scale up; simulation; tomography","National Science Foundation, NSF, (NSF-1845009, NSF-QII-TAQS-1936100); University of Washington, UW, (NNCI-1542101, NNCI-2025489)","This work was funded through the National Science Foundation grants NSF-QII-TAQS-1936100, NSF-1845009.

Among different considered single-atom catalysts (SAC), the osmium atom exhibits the most energetically favored NO-reduction pathway with the free energy change of −12.71 eV even at low NO coverage. Both nitrogen- and carbon-dominated large rings are capable of adsorbing NM atoms to form NM@C8N8 configurations. Fortunately, no clustering resulted for the noble metal atoms anchored onto the pristine C8N8 due to the substantial binding energy of −12.87 eV. The considered SACs exhibit their electrocatalytic activities by the dominant contribution to the total DOS around the Fermi level, especially for the Os, Ir, and Rh adatoms. At low NO coverage, NOER over Os@C8N8 proceeds the downhill profile diagram and demonstrates promising electrocatalytic performance in NO-reduction. Similarly, at high NO coverage, N2O2 can be adsorbed by NM@C8N8, due to the negative value of the free energy change. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","C<sub>8</sub>N<sub>8</sub>; NH<sub>3</sub> synthesis; NO electroreduction; Single-atom electrocatalyst","Ammonia; Atoms; Binding energy; Density of gases; Electrolytic reduction; Free energy; Monolayers; Precious metals; % reductions; Electro reduction; Free energy change; Lower density; Metal atoms; NH3 synthesis; NO electroreduction; NO reduction; Single-atom electrocatalyst; Single-atoms; Electrocatalysts","","","A.

The inspection of the structure, magnetic moment data and density plots, show that by substituting La by Mg at the La site at a concentration of 0.25, the compound exhibits a Pbnm orthorhombic structure and a half metallic ferromagnetic behaviour with degenerated Mn-eg states. The corresponding average A-site cation radius 〈rA〉 value does not allow metallic-insulator phase transition in the compound.

The most appealing property of the photonic synthetic dimension is its ability to emulate high-dimensional optical behavior in a unitary physical system. Here we show that the photonic synthetic dimension can transform technical problems in photonic systems between dimensionalities, providing unexpected solutions to technical problems that are otherwise challenging. Specifically, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a fully reconfigurable photonic Galton board (PGB) in the temporal synthetic dimension, in which the temporal high-speed challenge is translated into a spatial fiber-optic length matching problem, leading to the generation of tera-sample-per-second arbitrary waveforms with ultimate flexibility. In the experiments, an arbitrary waveform with a widely tunable sampling rate, ranging from 10.42 GSa/s to a record high of 1.64 TSa/s, is demonstrated. The concept of dimension conversion offers possible solutions to various physical dimension-related problems, such as super-resolution imaging, high-resolution spectroscopy, and high-precision time measurement. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Arbitrary waveform; Arbitrary waveform generation; Field manipulation; High-dimensional; Higher-dimensional; New dimensions; Optical behaviour; Particle manipulation; Property; Quantum physics; Spectroscopic analysis","Guangdong Engineering Technology Research Center for Integrated Space-Terrestrial Wireless Optical Communication; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB2800804)","Guangdong Province Key Field R&D Program Project (2020B0101110002); National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFB2800804); Guangdong Engineering Technology Research Center for Integrated Space-Terrestrial Wireless Optical Communication.

This suggests that H doping could have similar effects on the electronic and phononic spectra of materials at ambient pressure as well. Here, we demonstrate the non-volatile control of the electronic ground state of titanium diselenide (1T-TiSe2) via ionic liquid gating-driven H intercalation. This protonation induces a superconducting phase, observed together with a charge-density wave through most of the phase diagram, with nearly doping-independent transition temperatures. The H-induced superconducting phase is possibly gapless-like and multi-band in nature, in contrast with those induced in TiSe2 via copper, lithium, and electrostatic doping. This unique behavior is supported by ab initio calculations showing that high concentrations of H dopants induce a full reconstruction of the bandstructure, although with little coupling between electrons and high-frequency H phonons. Our findings provide a promising approach for engineering the ground state of transition metal dichalcogenides and other layered materials via gate-controlled protonation. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Charge density; Charge density waves; Ground state; Hydrogen; Ionic liquids; Protonation; Selenium compounds; Transition metals; Ambient pressures; Charge-density-waves; Electronic ground state; H doping; Hydrogen intercalation; Megabar; Nonvolatile; Protonations; Spectra's; Super conducting phasis; Titanium compounds","Department of Earth Sciences of the University of Pisa; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (2017Z8TS5B)","Funding text 1: E.P., S.R., G.Profeta, D.D. and R.S.G. acknowledge support from the MIUR PRIN-2017 program (Grant No.2017Z8TS5B – “Tuning and understanding Quantum phases in 2D materials – Quantum2D”).

The task of the original mathematical optimisation is then equivalent to finding the ground state of the corresponding spin system which can be achieved via quantum annealing relying on the adiabatic theorem. Some of the inherent disadvantages of this procedure can be alleviated or resolved using a stochastic approach, and by coupling to the external environment. We show that careful engineering of the system-bath coupling at an individual spin level can further improve annealing. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Environmental engineering; Fidelity; Ising model; Quantum annealing; Quantum computation","Annealing; Computation theory; Ground state; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Stochastic systems; Adiabatic theorem; External environments; Fidelity; Mathematical optimizations; Optimization problems; Quantum annealing; Spin systems; Spin-s systems; Stochastic approach; System-bath coupling; Ising model","","","M.

Quantum benchmarking provides key information on noise properties and is an important step for developing more advanced quantum processors. However, current benchmarking methods are either limited to a specific subset of quantum gates or cannot directly describe the performance of the individual target gate. To overcome these limitations, we propose channel spectrum benchmarking (CSB), a method to infer the noise properties of the target gate, including process fidelity, stochastic fidelity, and some unitary parameters, from the eigenvalues of its noisy channel. Our CSB method is insensitive to state-preparation and measurement errors, and importantly, can benchmark universal gates and is scalable to many-qubit systems. Unlike standard randomized schemes, CSB can provide direct noise information for both target native gates and circuit fragments, allowing benchmarking and calibration of global entangling gates and frequently used modules in quantum algorithms like Trotterized Hamiltonian evolution operator in quantum simulation. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","benchmarking; calibration; information; noise; quantum mechanics; simulation; spectrum; algorithm; article; benchmarking; calibration; controlled study; human; measurement error; noise; randomized controlled trial; simulation; stochastic model","Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0302400); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11974198, 12147123); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (Z220002)","This work was supported by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No. Z220002), the Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology (Grant No. 2021ZD0302400), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 12147123 and 11974198).

Several of these phenomena still lack interpretation from first principles since, hitherto, no approach is available to account for anharmonicity and disorder in electron–phonon couplings. Here, relying on the special displacement method, we develop a unified treatment of both and demonstrate that electron–phonon coupling is strongly influenced when we employ polymorphous perovskite networks. We uncover that polymorphism in halide perovskites leads to vibrational dynamics far from the ideal noninteracting phonon picture and drives the gradual change in their band gap around phase transition temperatures. We also clarify that combined band gap corrections arising from disorder, spin-orbit coupling, exchange–correlation functionals of high accuracy, and electron–phonon coupling are all essential. Our findings agree with experiments, suggesting that polymorphism is the key to address pending questions on perovskites’ technological applications. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Electron correlations; Electron-phonon interactions; Electrons; Energy gap; Polymorphism; Anharmonic; Anharmonicities; Displacement method; Electron phonon couplings; First principles; Gradual changes; Halide perovskites; Local disorder; Noninteracting; Vibrational dynamics; Perovskite","CSSI, (2103991); DMREF, (2119555, 861985, 899141); Texas Advanced Computing Center; National Science Foundation, NSF; University of Texas at Austin, UT; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (899546); European Commission, EC, (101106654, ULTRA-2DPK/HORIZON-MSCA-2022-PF-01); Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR; Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe AISBL, PRACE; Institut Universitaire de France, IUF","Funding text 1: We thank M.

However, precisely shaping MMAs in mesoporous nanostructures and mapping the distributions of multiple elements remain big challenge due to the different reduction kinetics of various metal precursors and the complexity of crystal growth. Here we design a one-pot wet-chemical reduction approach to synthesize core–shell motif PtPdRhRuCu mesoporous nanospheres (PtPdRhRuCu MMNs) using a diblock copolymer as the soft template. The PtPdRhRuCu MMNs feature adjustable compositions and exposed porous structures rich in highly entropic alloy sites. The formation processes of the mesoporous structures and the reduction and growth kinetics of different metal precursors of PtPdRhRuCu MMNs are revealed. The PtPdRhRuCu MMNs exhibit robust electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities and low overpotentials of 10, 13, and 28 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline (1.0 M KOH), acidic (0.5 M H2SO4), and neutral (1.0 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS)) electrolytes, respectively. The accelerated kinetics of the HER in PtPdRhRuCu MMNs are derived from multiple compositions with synergistic interactions among various metal sites and mesoporous structures with excellent mass/electron transportation characteristics. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Alloys; Catalysis; Crystallization; Electrons; Hydrogen; Nanospheres; alloy; copolymer; copper nanoparticle; core shell nanoparticle; element; hydrogen; macrogol; metal nanoparticle; nanosphere; palladium nanoparticle; phosphate buffered saline; platinum nanoparticle; poly(methyl methacrylate); ruthenium; alloy; catalysis; complexity; hydrogen; phosphate; reaction kinetics; acidity; adsorption; alkalinity; aqueous solution; Article; Brunauer Emmett Teller method; chemical composition; chronopotentiometry; current density; density functional theory; desorption; electrocatalytic water splitting; electron diffraction; elemental analysis; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; entropy; Fourier transform; high resolution transmission electron microscopy; hydrogen bond; hydrogen evolution reaction; impedance spectroscopy; linear sweep voltammetry; micelle; micellization; one pot synthesis; pore size distribution; porosity; reaction temperature; reduction kinetics; scanning electron microscopy; scanning transmission electron microscopy; surface property; transmission electron microscopy; X ray crystallography; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; X ray powder diffraction; catalysis; crystallization; electron","JST-ERATO Yamauchi Materials Space-Tectonics Project, (JPMJER2003); National Computational Infrastructure, NCI; Australian Government; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP200103568, DP230101625)","This work was supported by the JST-ERATO Yamauchi Materials Space-Tectonics Project (JPMJER2003).

Here, we develop bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) single crystals into effective X-ray detectors. BiOI features complex lattice dynamics, owing to the ionic character of the lattice and weak van der Waals interactions between layers. Through use of ultrafast spectroscopy, first-principles computations and detailed optical and structural characterisation, we show that photoexcited charge-carriers in BiOI couple to intralayer breathing phonon modes, forming large polarons, thus enabling longer drift lengths for the photoexcited carriers than would be expected if self-trapping occurred. This, combined with the low and stable dark currents and high linear X-ray attenuation coefficients, leads to strong detector performance. High sensitivities reaching 1.1 × 103 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 are achieved, and the lowest dose rate directly measured by the detectors was 22 nGyair s−1. The photophysical principles discussed herein offer new design avenues for novel materials with heavy elements and low-dimensional electronic structures for (opto)electronic applications. © 2023, The Author(s).","","bismuth iodide oxide; bismuth; crystal structure; lattice dynamics; X-ray analysis; Article; phonon; radiation dose; spectroscopy; structure analysis; surface property; X ray","ANR-10-LABX-0037-NEXT, (DIR/WK/2018/07); Bill Welland, (EP/L015978/1); Department of Chemistry at the University of Oxford; Downing College Cambridge, (EP/V014498/2); Gianna Angelopoulos Programme for Science, Innovation and Technology, (EP/P020259/1); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (756962, 957513, IEC\R2\170108); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (MR/V023926/1); Schiff Foundation, (EP/R023980/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/N509620/1); Royal Academy of Engineering, RAENG, (CIET1819_24, RF\201718\1701); Royal Society; British Council, (608412749); University of Cambridge; European Research Council, ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (387651688); Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (2019/33/B/ST3/01915); Isaac Newton Trust; Tata Sons, (EP/W004445/1, UF150033); Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Prof. Richard Phillips (University of Cambridge) for useful feedback on the manuscript and help with optical measurements.

The class XIV myosin motor PfMyoA is part of a core macromolecular complex called the glideosome, essential for Plasmodium parasite mobility and therefore an attractive drug target. Here, we characterize the interaction of a small molecule (KNX-002) with PfMyoA. KNX-002 inhibits PfMyoA ATPase activity in vitro and blocks asexual blood stage growth of merozoites, one of three motile Plasmodium life-cycle stages. Combining biochemical assays and X-ray crystallography, we demonstrate that KNX-002 inhibits PfMyoA using a previously undescribed binding mode, sequestering it in a post-rigor state detached from actin. KNX-002 binding prevents efficient ATP hydrolysis and priming of the lever arm, thus inhibiting motor activity. This small-molecule inhibitor of PfMyoA paves the way for the development of alternative antimalarial treatments. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Actins; Antimalarials; Biological Assay; Folic Acid Antagonists; Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA; Plasmodium falciparum; adenosine triphosphatase; antimalarial agent; blebbistatin; ck 2140597; F actin; knx 002; myosin; myosin a; unclassified drug; actin; antimalarial agent; folic acid antagonist; myosin IIA; blood; disease treatment; drug; growth rate; hydrolysis; inhibition; inhibitor; parasite; actin polymerization; antimalarial activity; Article; ATPase activity assay; biochemical analysis; cell kinetics; comparative study; controlled study; crystallization; drug binding; drug design; drug mechanism; drug protein binding; drug structure; hanging drop vapor diffusion method; high throughput screening; IC50; in vitro study; kinetics; malaria; merozoite; motor activity; nonhuman; nucleotide binding site; plasmodium (life cycle stage); Plasmodium falciparum; protein expression; protein hydrolysis; site directed mutagenesis; static electricity; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; X ray crystallography; bioassay; Plasmodium falciparum","Cytokinetics and consults for Kainomyx; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01AI 132378); Wellcome Trust, WT, (100993/Z/13/Z); University of Vermont, UVM; International Research Foundation for English Language Education, TIRF; Cytokinetics, CYTK, (KNX-002); Human Frontier Science Program, HFSP, (RGY006/2016); European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, ESRF; Medicines for Malaria Venture, MMV, (RD-08-2800); Institut Curie","Funding text 1: A.H. receives research funding from Cytokinetics and consults for Kainomyx.

Although significant progress has been made in the quantum simulation of simple molecules, ab initio simulation of solid-state materials on quantum computers is still in its early stage, mostly owing to the fact that the system size quickly becomes prohibitively large when approaching the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we introduce an orbital-based multifragment approach on top of the periodic density matrix embedding theory, resulting in a significantly smaller problem size for the current near-term quantum computer. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method compared with the conventional methodologies and experiments on solid-state systems with complex electronic structures. These include spin-polarized states of a hydrogen chain (1D-H), the equation of state of a boron nitride layer (h-BN) as well as the magnetic ordering in nickel oxide (NiO), a prototypical strongly correlated solid. Our results suggest that quantum embedding combined with a chemically intuitive fragmentation can greatly advance quantum simulation of realistic materials, thereby paving the way for solving important yet classically hard industrial problems on near-term quantum devices. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Boron nitride; Computation theory; Electronic structure; Embeddings; Equations of state; III-V semiconductors; Nickel oxide; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Ab initio; Chemical applications; Drug discovery; Embeddings; Materials design; Quanta computers; Quantum chemical; Quantum Computing; Quantum simulations; Strongly correlated materials; Quantum computers","","","D.

It has established the possibility to construct activity volcano plots as a function of a single or two readily accessible adsorption energies as descriptors, but also limited the maximal catalytic conversion rate. In this work, it is found that these established adsorption energy-based descriptor spaces are not applicable to electrochemistry, because they are lacking an important additional dimension, the potential of zero charge. This extra dimension arises from the interaction of the electric double layer with reaction intermediates which does not scale with adsorption energies. At the example of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 it is shown that the addition of this descriptor breaks the scaling relations, opening up a huge chemical space that is readily accessible via potential of zero charge-based material design. The potential of zero charge also explains product selectivity trends of electrochemical CO2 reduction in close agreement with reported experimental data highlighting its importance for electrocatalyst design. © 2023, The Author(s).","","carbon dioxide; adsorption; catalysis; catalyst; electrochemical method; electrochemistry; electrokinesis; reduction; adsorption; Article; catalyst; controlled study; electrochemical analysis; electrochemistry; energy; space","College of Science, Korea University; Korea Basic Science Institute, KBSI; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (KSC-2021-CRE-0410, NRF-2021R1C1C1008776); Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, KAIST","Funding text 1: S.R. acknowledges the financial support provided by the National Research Foundation of Korea (Grant No. NRF-2021R1C1C1008776) and the support of the National Supercomputing Center for supercomputing resources, including technical support (No. KSC-2021-CRE-0410).

First and foremost, the structural stability in terms of their ground state energies has been keenly evaluated from their corresponding structural optimizations, which advocate that XTiBr3 (X = Rb, Cs) has a stable ferromagnetic rather than the competing non-magnetic phase. Later on, the electronic properties have been computed within the mix of two applied potential schemes like Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) along with Trans-Bhala modified Becke Johnson (TB-mBJ), which thoroughly addresses the half-metallic behaviour with spin-up as metallic and in contrast to opposite spin-down channel signatures the semiconducting behaviour. Furthermore, the spin-splitting seen from their corresponding spin-polarised band structures offers a net magnetism of 2 µB which lends their opportunities to unlock the application branch of spintronics. In addition, these alloys have been characterised to show their mechanical stability describing the ductile feature. Moreover, phonon dispersions decisively certify the dynamical stability within the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) context.

However, this class of solid-state electrolytes suffers from structural and chemical instability in humid air environments and a lack of compatibility with layered oxide positive electrode active materials. To circumvent these issues, here, we propose Li6+xMxAs1-xS5I (M=Si, Sn) as sulfide solid electrolytes.

While its iterative process systematically reaches the ground state energy, practical implementations of ADAPT-VQE are sensitive to local energy minima, leading to over-parameterized ansätze. We introduce the Overlap-ADAPT-VQE to grow wave-functions by maximizing their overlap with any intermediate target wave-function that already captures some electronic correlation. By avoiding building the ansatz in the energy landscape strewn with local minima, the Overlap-ADAPT-VQE produces ultra-compact ansätze suitable for high-accuracy initialization of a new ADAPT procedure. Significant advantages over ADAPT-VQE are observed for strongly correlated systems including substantial savings in circuit depth. Since this compression strategy can also be initialized with accurate Selected-Configuration Interaction (SCI) classical target wave-functions, it paves the way for chemically accurate simulations of larger systems, and strengthens the promise of decisively surpassing classical quantum chemistry through the power of quantum computing. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Ground state; Iterative methods; Quantum computers; Wave functions; Chemical systems; Classical simulation; Ground-state energies; Iterative process; Local energy minima; Quanta computers; Quantum chemical; Quantum-classical; Robust algorithm; Target waves; Quantum chemistry","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (810367, ANR-22-PETQ-0007); European Research Council, ERC","Funding text 1: This work has been funded in part by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant No. 810367), project EMC2 (J.-P.P. and Y.M.).

Yet, lack of additivity overthrows the traditional picture for entanglement scaling and transport, due to the breakdown of the common mechanism based on excitations propagation and confinement. Here, we describe the dynamics of the entanglement entropy in many-body quantum systems with a diverging contribution to the internal energy from the long-range two body potential. While in the strict thermodynamic limit entanglement dynamics is shown to be suppressed, a rich mosaic of novel scaling regimes is observed at intermediate system sizes, due to the possibility to trigger multiple resonant modes in the global dynamics. Quantitative predictions on the shape and timescales of entanglement propagation are made, paving the way to the observation of these phases in current quantum simulators. This picture is connected and contrasted with the case of local many body systems subject to Floquet driving. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (EXC2181/1-390900948); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (200021 207537)","This research was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) grant number 200021 207537 and by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy EXC2181/1-390900948 (the Heidelberg STRUCTURES Excellence Cluster).

O. Box 68528, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","The impressive pace of advance of quantum technology calls for robust and scalable techniques for the characterization and validation of quantum hardware. Quantum process tomography, the reconstruction of an unknown quantum channel from measurement data, remains the quintessential primitive to completely characterize quantum devices. However, due to the exponential scaling of the required data and classical post-processing, its range of applicability is typically restricted to one- and two-qubit gates. Here, we present a technique for performing quantum process tomography that addresses these issues by combining a tensor network representation of the channel with a data-driven optimization inspired by unsupervised machine learning. We demonstrate our technique through synthetically generated data for ideal one- and two-dimensional random quantum circuits of up to 10 qubits, and a noisy 5-qubit circuit, reaching process fidelities above 0.99 using several orders of magnitude fewer (single-qubit) measurement shots than traditional tomographic techniques. Our results go far beyond state-of-the-art, providing a practical and timely tool for benchmarking quantum circuits in current and near-term quantum computers. © 2023, The Author(s).","","quantum dot; learning; moment tensor; quantum mechanics; reconstruction; tomography; unsupervised classification; algorithm; Article; benchmarking; cross validation; deep neural network; human; probability; quantum process tomography; singular value decomposition; tomography; unsupervised machine learning","Flatiron Institute; Google Quantum Research Award; Simons Foundation Super-Computing Center; National Science Foundation, NSF, (PHY-1748958); Simons Foundation, SF; Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, KITP; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, CIFAR; Compute Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (305420/2018-6); Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, FAPERJ, (JCN E-26/202.701/2018); Instituto Serrapilheira, (Serra-1709-17173)","Funding text 1: We thank M.

With the advent of various special purpose devices and domain specific hardware, it has become increasingly important to establish clear benchmarks of what improvements these technologies offer compared to existing technologies. In this paper, we demonstrate 2 to 3 orders of magnitude acceleration of a standard QMC algorithm using a specially designed digital processor, and a further 2 to 3 orders of magnitude by mapping it to a clockless analog processor. Our demonstration provides a roadmap for 5 to 6 orders of magnitude acceleration for a transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and could possibly be extended to other QMC models as well. The clockless analog hardware can be viewed as the classical counterpart of the quantum annealer and provides performance within a factor of < 10 of the latter. The convergence time for the clockless analog hardware scales with the number of qubits as ∼ N, improving the ∼ N2 scaling for CPU implementations, but appears worse than that reported for quantum annealers by D-Wave. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Annealing; Clocks; Computer hardware; Ising model; Analog hardware; Digital processors; Domain specific; Monte carlo algorithms; Monte Carlo techniques; Optimized algorithms; Orders of magnitude; Probabilistics; Quantum monte carlo; Specific hardware; Monte Carlo methods","ASCENT; Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, (IN 47907); FPGA; Office of Naval Research, ONR; Semiconductor Research Corporation, SRC; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by ASCENT, one of six centers in JUMP, a Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) program sponsored by DARPA.

The resolution to this paradox is to recognize that global unitary evolution of a multi-partite quantum state causes the state of local subsystems to evolve towards maximum-entropy states. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate this effect in linear quantum optics by simultaneously showing the convergence of local quantum states to a generalized Gibbs ensemble constituting a maximum-entropy state under precisely controlled conditions, while introducing an efficient certification method to demonstrate that the state retains global purity. Our quantum states are manipulated by a programmable integrated quantum photonic processor, which simulates arbitrary non-interacting Hamiltonians, demonstrating the universality of this phenomenon. Our results show the potential of photonic devices for quantum simulations involving non-Gaussian states. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Computer Simulation; Entropy; Photons; Physics; Thermodynamics; equipment; integrated approach; physics; simulation; thermodynamics; article; certification; maximum entropy model; quantum optics; simulation; thermodynamics; computer simulation; entropy; photon; physics; thermodynamics","Einstein Foundation; Munich Quantum Valley, (K-8); QUCHIP, (H2020-FETPROACT-2014); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (817482, PASQuanS2); H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (846073); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (K034480, N509711, P510257, T001062); European Research Council, ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (CRC 183, EI 519/21-1, FOR 2724); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (QPIC-1); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (15872, 680.91.037); Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes","The Berlin team acknowledges funding from the BMBF (QPIC-1, PhoQuant), DFG (specifically EI 519/21-1 on paradigmatic quantum devices, but also CRC 183, project A03, on entangled states of matter, and FOR 2724 on quantum thermodynamics), the FQXi, the Einstein Foundation (Einstein Research Unit), the Munich Quantum Valley (K-8), and the Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes.

Specifically, we show that the chirality of photonic bound state, that emerges in the bandgap of the waveguide, depends only on the energy of the qubit; a parameter that is easy to tune in many artificial atoms. In contrast to previous proposals that have either shown imperfect chirality or fixed directionality, our waveguide quantum electrodynamics scheme achieves both perfect chirality and the capability to switch the directionality on demand with just one tunable element in the device. We also show that our model is easy to implement in both state-of-the-art superconducting circuit and quantum dot architectures. The results show technological promise in creating long-range couplers between qubits while maintaining, in principle, zero crosstalk. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Electrodynamics; Quantum optics; Qubits; Semiconductor quantum dots; Waveguides; Artificial atoms; Bound-states; Edge state; Energy; Quantum electrodynamics; Quantum emitters; Quantum system; Tunables; Tunnel coupling; Waveguide array; Chirality","Silicon Valley Community Foundation, SVCF; Foundational Questions Institute, FQxI; Australian Research Council, ARC, (CE170100009, FQXi-IAF19-04)","P.P., N.P.K. and A.F. were supported by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems (EQUS, CE170100009).

When synthesizing quantum circuits using the basic gate library, which consists of CNOT and single-qubit gates, CNOT gates are required to convert a quantum circuit into one suitable for an NN architecture. In the basic gate library, CNOT gates are considered the primary cost of quantum circuits due to their higher error rates and longer execution times compared to single-qubit gates. In this paper, we propose a new linear NN (LNN) circuit design for quantum Fourier transform (QFT), one of the most versatile subroutines in quantum algorithms. Our LNN QFT circuit has only about 40% of the number of CNOT gates compared to previously known LNN QFT circuits. Subsequently, we input both our QFT circuits and conventional QFT circuits into the Qiskit transpiler to construct QFTs on IBM quantum computers, which necessitate NN architectures. Consequently, our QFT circuits demonstrate a substantial advantage over conventional QFT circuits in terms of the number of CNOT gates. This outcome implies that the proposed LNN QFT circuit design could serve as a novel foundation for developing QFT circuits implemented in quantum hardware that demands NN architecture. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","NRF-2023R1A2C1003570, (RS-2023-00225385); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA2386-21-1-0089, FA2386-22-1-4052); International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Amazon Web Services, AWS; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (IITP-2023- 2021-0-01810, NRF-2020M3E4A1080031, NRF-2020M3H3A1105796)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Korea National Research Foundation (NRF) grant No. NRF-2020M3E4A1080031: Quantum circuit optimization for efficient quantum computing, NRF grant No. NRF-2020M3H3A1105796, ICT R&D program of IITP-2023- 2021-0-01810, NRF-2023R1A2C1003570, RS-2023-00225385, AFOSR grant FA2386-21-1-0089, AFOSR grant FA2386-22-1-4052, and Amazon Web Services.

Here, we consider three-component fermions with attractive interactions to study the formation of complex bound states, whose nature goes beyond the standard fermion pairing occurring in quantum materials. Such systems display clear analogies with quark matter. We address the nature of the bound states of a three-component fermionic system in a ring-shaped trap through the persistent current. In this way, we demonstrate that we can distinguish between color superfluid and trionic bound states. By analyzing finite temperature effects, we show how finite temperature can lead to the deconfinement of bound states. For weak interactions, the deconfinement occurs because of scattering states. In this regime, the deconfinement depends on the trade-off between interactions and thermal fluctuations. For strong interactions the features of the persistent current result from the properties of a suitable gas of bound states. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Economic and social effects; Attractive interactions; Bound-states; Cold atoms; Deconfinement; Degree of control; Finite temperatures; Many-body effect; Operating condition; Persistent currents; Three-component; Quantum theory","","","W.J.

Here we show that the anomalous Hall effect in pristine Cr2Te3 thin films manifests a unique temperature-dependent sign reversal at nonzero magnetization, resulting from the momentum-space Berry curvature as established by first-principles simulations. The sign change is strain tunable, enabled by the sharp and well-defined substrate/film interface in the quasi-two-dimensional Cr2Te3 epitaxial films, revealed by scanning transmission electron microscopy and depth-sensitive polarized neutron reflectometry. This Berry phase effect further introduces hump-shaped Hall peaks in pristine Cr2Te3 near the coercive field during the magnetization switching process, owing to the presence of strain-modulated magnetic layers/domains. The versatile interface tunability of Berry curvature in Cr2Te3 thin films offers new opportunities for topological electronics. © 2023, The Author(s).","","chromium; curvature; electron microscopy; magnetization; neutron diffraction; telluride; topology; transition element; Article; berry; chemical structure; epitaxy; neutron; reflectometry; scanning transmission electron microscopy","Center for Integrated Quantum Materials, (1231319); Laboratory for Physical Sciences; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, (2137603, 2138259, 2138286, 2138296, 2138307, DMR130081, DMR—1419807, W911NF-16-2-0008); National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMR-1905662); Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-20-1-2306); Division of Materials Research, DMR, (1700137, 2218550); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (DGE 1633587, FA9550-20-1-0247); Army Research Office, ARO, (DURIP W911NF-20-1-0074, W911NF-20-2-0061); Office of Science, SC; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL; Army Research Laboratory, ARL, (W911NF-19-2-0015); North Carolina State University, NCSU, (ECCS-2025064)","Funding text 1: The work at MIT was supported by the Army Research Office (W911NF-20-2-0061 and DURIP W911NF-20-1-0074), National Science Foundation (NSF-DMR 1700137 and 2218550), and Office of Naval Research (N00014-20-1-2306).

In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing era, this is a significant challenge given quantum resources are scarce and typically only low-depth quantum circuits can be implemented on physical devices. We present a genetic algorithm for state preparation (GASP) which generates relatively low-depth quantum circuits for initialising a quantum computer in a specified quantum state. The method uses a basis set of Rx , Ry , Rz , and CNOT gates and a genetic algorithm to systematically generate circuits to synthesize the target state to the required fidelity. GASP can produce more efficient circuits of a given accuracy with lower depth and gate counts than other methods. This variability of the required accuracy facilitates overall higher accuracy on implementation, as error accumulation in high-depth circuits can be avoided. We directly compare the method to the state initialisation technique based on an exact synthesis technique by implemented in IBM Qiskit simulated with noise and implemented on physical IBM Quantum devices. Results achieved by GASP outperform Qiskit’s exact general circuit synthesis method on a variety of states such as Gaussian states and W-states, and consistently show the method reduces the number of gates required for the quantum circuits to generate these quantum states to the required accuracy. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; University of Melbourne, UNIMELB","This research was supported by the University of Melbourne through the establishment of the IBM Quantum Network Hub at the University.

In the quantum and classical domains, higher-order EPs for PT symmetry and APT -symmetry systems have been proposed and realized. Both two-qubits APT - APT and PT - PT symmetric systems have seen an increase in recent years, especially in the dynamics of quantum entanglement. However, to our knowledge, neither theoretical nor experimental investigations have been conducted for the dynamics of two-qubits entanglement in the PT - APT symmetric system. We investigate the PT - APT dynamics for the first time. Moreover, we examine the impact of different initial Bell-state conditions on entanglement dynamics in PT - PT , APT - APT and PT - APT symmetric systems. Additionally, we conduct a comparative study of entanglement dynamics in the PT - PT symmetrical system, APT - APT symmetrical system, and PT - APT symmetrical systems in order to learn more about non-Hermitian quantum systems and their environments. Entangled qubits evolve in a PT - APT symmetric unbroken regime, the entanglement oscillates with two different oscillation frequencies, and the entanglement is well preserved for a long period of time for the case when non-Hermitian parts of both qubits are taken quite away from the exceptional points. © 2023, The Author(s).","","article; comparative study; controlled study; oscillation; parity; photon","Beijing Municipal Institutions, (BPHR202203034); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11705004, 12175002); Higher Education Commission, Pakistan, HEC, (14544); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (1222020)","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Beijing (Grant No. 1222020), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 12175002, 11705004), the Project of Cultivation for Young top-notch Talents of Beijing Municipal Institutions (BPHR202203034).

While progress has been made in improving performance, single photon detectors that can maintain high performance while also resolving the photon frequency are still lacking. By means of quantum simulations, we show that nanoscale elements cooperatively interacting with the photon field in a photodetector architecture allow to simultaneously achieve high efficiency, low jitter, and high frequency resolution. We discuss how such cooperative interactions are essential to reach this performance regime, analyzing the factors that impact performance and trade-offs between metrics. We illustrate the potential performance for frequency resolution over a 1 eV bandwidth in the visible range, indicating near perfect detection efficiency, jitter of a few hundred femtoseconds, and frequency resolution of tens of meV. Finally, a potential physical realization of such an architecture is presented based on carbon nanotubes functionalized with quantum dots. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Architecture; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Jitter; Photons; Semiconductor quantum dots; Basic science; Frequency resolutions; Improving performance; Nanoscale architectures; Performance; Photon frequency; Science and Technology; Science applications; Single-photon detectors; Technology application; Particle beams","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA, (DE-NA-0003525)","We thank the members of the LBNL-SNL-UC Berkeley Co-Design and Integration of nano-sensors on CMOS collaboration for useful discussions.

Only for a few idealized scenarios, there are analytic results for the optimal measurement set for QST. E.g., in a setting of non-degenerate measurements, an optimal minimal set of measurement operators for QST has eigenbases which are mutually unbiased. However, in other set-ups, dependent on the rank of the projection operators and the size of the quantum system, the optimal choice of measurements for efficient QST needs to be numerically approximated. We have generalized this problem by introducing the framework of customized efficient QST. Here we extend customized QST and look for the optimal measurement set for QST in the case where some of the quantum gates applied in the measurement process are noisy. To achieve this, we use two distinct noise models: first, the depolarizing channel, and second, over- and under-rotation in single-qubit and to two-qubit gates (for further information, please see Methods). We demonstrate the benefit of using entangling gates for the efficient QST measurement schemes for two qubits at realistic noise levels, by comparing the fidelity of reconstruction of our optimized QST measurement set to the state-of-the-art scheme using only product bases. © 2023, The Author(s).","High-dimensional optimization problem; Noise; Quantum computing; Quantum gates; Quantum tomography","Quantum channel; Quantum optics; Qubits; Tomography; High-dimensional optimization; High-dimensional optimization problem; Measurement sets; Noise; Optimal measurements; Optimization problems; Quantum Computing; Quantum gates; Quantum state tomography; Quantum tomography; Logic gates","Bulgarian National Science Fund, BNSF, (KP-06-M 32/1); Universität Konstanz","This work was partially supported by the Zukunftskolleg (University of Konstanz) and the Bulgarian National Science Fund under the contract No KP-06-M 32/1.

In this work we implement a digital simulation of the discrete time quantum dynamics of a spin- 12 XXZ spin chain on a noisy near-term quantum device, and we extract the high temperature transport exponent at the isotropic point. We simulate the temporal decay of the relevant spin correlation function at high temperature using a pseudo-random state generated by a random circuit that is specifically tailored to the ibmq-montreal 27 qubit device. The resulting output is a spin excitation on a homogeneous background on a 21 qubit chain on the device. From the subsequent discrete time dynamics on the device we are able to extract an anomalous super-diffusive exponent consistent with the conjectured Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling at the isotropic point.

We find that the 2HPβCD’s atoms become more rigid in the presence of chlordiazepoxide (CDP), clonazepam (CLZ), and diazepam (DZM), whereas they become more flexible in the presence of nordazepam (NDM) and nitrazepam (NZP). We also investigated the structure of 2HPβCD and found that loading these drugs increases both the area and volume of the 2HPβCD cavity, making it more suitable for drug delivery. Moreover, this research found that all drugs exhibited negative values for the binding free energy, indicating thermodynamic favorability and improved solubility. The binding free energy order of the BZDs was consistent in both molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods, with CDP and DZM having the highest affinity for binding. We also analyzed the contribution of different interaction energies in binding between the carrier and the drugs and found that Van der Waals energy is the primary component.

One such collective excitation, known as a topological Majorana mode, is naturally stable against perturbations, such as unwanted local noise, and can thereby robustly store quantum information. As such, Majorana modes serve as the basic primitive of topological quantum computing, providing resilience to errors. However, their demonstration on quantum hardware has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate a verifiable identification and braiding of topological Majorana modes using a superconducting quantum processor as a quantum simulator. By simulating fermions on a one-dimensional lattice subject to a periodic drive, we confirm the existence of Majorana modes localized at the edges, and distinguish them from other trivial modes. To simulate a basic logical operation of topological quantum computing known as braiding, we propose a non-adiabatic technique, whose implementation reveals correct braiding statistics in our experiments. This work could further be used to study topological models of matter using circuit-based simulations, and shows that long-sought quantum phenomena can be realized by anyone in cloud-run quantum simulations, whereby accelerating fundamental discoveries in quantum science and technology. © 2023, The Author(s).","","hardware; perturbation; quantum mechanics; simulator; topology; adiabaticity; Article; controlled study; correlation function; electron; fermion; Fourier transform; quantum chemistry; simulation","IBM Research Frontiers Institute; National Science Foundation, NSF, (PHY-1748958)","We thank Frank Pollmann and Bela Bauer for helpful discussions.

The possibility to actuate on them with a time dependent drive could provide for example the means to induce resonant inter-level transitions, or to perform Floquet engineering or Landau-Zener-Stückelberg state preparation. Here, we introduce polaromechanical metamaterials, two-dimensional arrays of μm-sized traps confining zero-dimensional light-matter polariton fluids and GHz phonons. A strong exciton-mediated polariton-phonon interaction induces a time-dependent inter-site polariton coupling J(t) with remarkable consequences for the dynamics. When locally perturbed by continuous wave optical excitation, a mechanical self-oscillation sets-in and polaritons respond by locking the energy detuning between neighbor sites at integer multiples of the phonon energy, evidencing asynchronous locking involving the polariton and phonon fields. These results open the path for the coherent control of dissipative quantum light fluids with hypersound in a scalable platform. © 2023, The Author(s).","","array; lattice dynamics; oscillation; quantum mechanics; article; excitation; oscillation; phonon; sound","ANPCyT-FONCyT, (PICT 2018-1509, PICT-2015-1063, PICT-2016-0791, PICT-2018-03255); Facundo Fainstein; PAIDI 2020, (P20-00548); SeCyT-UNCuyo, (06/C603); Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, AvH; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (359162958); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET, (PIP 11220150100506); Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación, MINCyT; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO, (V505023N); Ministry of Science and Technology, Croatia","Funding text 1: We acknowledge partial financial support from the ANPCyT-FONCyT (Argentina) under grants PICT-2015-1063, PICT-2018-03255, PICT-2016-0791, and PICT 2018-1509, CONICET grant PIP 11220150100506, SeCyT-UNCuyo grant 06/C603, from the German Research Foundation (DFG) under grant 359162958, and the joint Bilateral Cooperation Program between the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Argentinian Ministry of Science and Technology (MINCyT) and CONICET.

However, exploring the applicability of quantum kernels in more realistic settings has been hindered by the number of physical qubits current noisy quantum computers have, thereby limiting the number of features encoded for quantum kernels. Hence, there is a need for an efficient, application-specific simulator for quantum computing by using classical technology. Here we focus on quantum kernels empirically designed for image classification and demonstrate a field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) implementation. We show that the quantum kernel estimation by our heterogeneous CPU–FPGA computing is 470 times faster than that by a conventional CPU implementation. The co-design of our application-specific quantum kernel and its efficient FPGA implementation enabled us to perform one of the largest numerical simulations of a gate-based quantum kernel in terms of features, up to 780-dimensional features. We apply our quantum kernel to classification tasks using the Fashion-MNIST dataset and show that our quantum kernel is comparable to Gaussian kernels with the optimized hyperparameter. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, AIST","We thank Hideki Asoh (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology) for useful discussions.","T.

The goal is a better understanding of transport in non-Hermitian systems like the Lieb lattice due to its flat bands and the integrability of the Ising chain which allows transport in that model to be computed analytically. This is a very special feature that is not present in a generic non-Hermitian system. We obtain the behaviour of the spin conductivity as a function of the non-Hermitian parameters of each system with aim to verify the influence of variation them on conductivity. For all models analyzed: Ising model as well as noninteracting fermion models, we obtain a little influence of the non-Hermitian parameters on conductivity and thus, a small effect over transport coefficients. Furthermore, we obtain an influence of opening of the gap in the spectrum in these models on longitudinal conductivity as well. © 2023, The Author(s).","","article; conductance; fermion","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","This work was partially supported by National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) Brazil.

In this study, we report the fabrication of 1D single-unit-cell-width CrCl3 atomic wires and their stacked few-wire arrays on the surface of a van der Waals (vdW) superconductor NbSe2. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and first-principles calculations jointly revealed that the single wire shows an antiferromagnetic large-bandgap semiconducting state in an unexplored structure different from the well-known 2D CrCl3 phase. Competition among the total energies and nanostructure-substrate interfacial interactions of these two phases result in the appearance of the 1D phase. This phase was transformable to the 2D phase either prior to or after the growth for in situ or ex situ manipulations, in which the electronic interactions at the vdW interface play a nontrivial role that could regulate the dimensionality conversion and structural transformation between the 1D-2D CrCl3 phases. © 2023, The Author(s).","","chromium chloride; nanomaterial; detection method; in situ measurement; superconductivity; transformation; Article; chemical structure; density functional theory; growth curve; molecular beam epitaxy; scanning tunneling microscopy; spectroscopy","Outstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation; Shanghai Supercomputer Center; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11974012, 11974422, 12104504, 12134011, 21802165, 61888102); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDB30000000); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2019M652694, 2021M693479); Renmin University of China, RUC, (22XNKJ30); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018FYA0305800, 2018YFA0703700, 2018YFE0202700); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","Funding text 1: We thank the support from the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant nos. 2018FYA0305800, 2018YFA0703700, 2018YFE0202700), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 11974012, 12134011, 61888102, 21802165, 11974422, and 12104504), the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant no.

Quantum dots and donors in semiconductor technology define a natural approach to implement quantum simulation. Several material platforms have been used to study interacting charge states, while gallium arsenide has also been used to investigate spin evolution. However, decoherence remains a key challenge in simulating coherent quantum dynamics. Here, we introduce quantum simulation using hole spins in germanium quantum dots. We demonstrate extensive and coherent control enabling the tuning of multi-spin states in isolated, paired, and fully coupled quantum dots. We then focus on the simulation of resonating valence bonds and measure the evolution between singlet product states which remains coherent over many periods. Finally, we realize four-spin states with s-wave and d-wave symmetry. These results provide means to perform non-trivial and coherent simulations of correlated electron systems. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Germanium; III-V semiconductors; Nanocrystals; Quantum chemistry; Quantum optics; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor quantum dots; Shear waves; Spin dynamics; Condensed matter system; Germaniums (Ge); Natural approaches; Quantum simulations; Quantum simulators; Quantum system; Resonating valence bonds; Semiconductor technology; Spin state; Tunables; Gallium arsenide","Army Research Office, ARO, (NWA.1292.19.194, W911NF-17-1-0274); European Research Council, ERC; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","We thank T.-K.

Here, we report a fermionic lattice-model-type realization of an analogue black hole by using a chain of 10 superconducting transmon qubits with interactions mediated by 9 transmon-type tunable couplers. The quantum walks of quasi-particle in the curved spacetime reflect the gravitational effect near the black hole, resulting in the behaviour of stimulated Hawking radiation, which is verified by the state tomography measurement of all 7 qubits outside the horizon. In addition, the dynamics of entanglement in the curved spacetime is directly measured. Our results would stimulate more interests to explore the related features of black holes using the programmable superconducting processor with tunable couplers. © 2023, The Author(s).","","quantum mechanics; simulation; superconductivity; tomography; article; black hole; simulation; tomography","Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2-6); Synergetic Extreme Condition User Facility; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11904393, 11934018, 92065114, 92265207, T2121001); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDB28000000, YJKYYQ20200041); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (12005155, Z200009); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B0303030001)","This work was supported by the Synergetic Extreme Condition User Facility (SECUF).

Especially, systems with a large Hilbert space are hard to solve for classical computers and thus ideal targets for a simulation with quantum hardware. In this work, we study experimentally the transient dynamics in the multistate Landau-Zener model as a function of the Landau-Zener velocity. The underlying Hamiltonian is emulated by superconducting quantum circuit, where a tunable transmon qubit is coupled to a bosonic mode ensemble comprising four lumped element microwave resonators. We investigate the model for different initial states: Due to our circuit design, we are not limited to merely exciting the qubit, but can also pump the harmonic modes via a dedicated drive line. Here, the nature of the transient dynamics depends on the average photon number in the excited resonator. The greater effective coupling strength between qubit and higher Fock states results in a quasi-adiabatic transition, where coherent quantum oscillations are suppressed without the introduction of additional loss channels. Our experiments pave the way for more complex simulations with qubits coupled to an engineered bosonic mode spectrum. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Bosons; Dynamics; Integrated circuit manufacture; Microwave devices; Microwave resonators; Qubits; Superconducting resonators; Bosonic modes; Landau-Zener; Landau-Zener models; Multi-state; Quantum Computing; Quantum simulations; Superconducting quantum circuit; Transient dynamics; Transmon qubit; Tunables; Quantum chemistry","Helmholtz International Research School for Teratronics; KIT Nanostructure Service Laboratory; Landesgraduiertenförderung Baden-Württemberg; NSL; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/T001062/1); European Research Council, ERC, (648011); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (INST 121384/138-1FUGG, WE 4359-7); Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes; Helmholtz Association","Cleanroom facilities use was supported by the KIT Nanostructure Service Laboratory (NSL).

At optical frequencies, this interaction unlocks a way to explore and control new chemical phenomena at the nanoscale. Achieving such control at ultrafast timescales, however, is an outstanding challenge, as it requires a deep understanding of the dynamics of the collectively coupled molecular excitation and the light modes. Here, we investigate the dynamics of collective polariton states, realized by coupling molecular photoswitches to optically anisotropic plasmonic nanoantennas. Pump-probe experiments reveal an ultrafast collapse of polaritons to pure molecular transition triggered by femtosecond-pulse excitation at room temperature. Through a synergistic combination of experiments and quantum mechanical modelling, we show that the response of the system is governed by intramolecular dynamics, occurring one order of magnitude faster with respect to the uncoupled excited molecule relaxation to the ground state. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Anisotropy; Heart Rate; Photons; Records; antenna; biochemical phenomena; collapse; light intensity; wavelength; Article; collapse; excitation; leisure; molecular dynamics; physical model; pump probe spectroscopy; room temperature; anisotropy; heart rate; information processing; photon","Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (Formas), (2021-01390, 2021-05784, JCK-3122); Wenner-Gren Foundation, WGF, (UPD2022-0074); HORIZON EUROPE European Innovation Council, EIC, (101046920); European Commission, EC, (964363); European Research Council, ERC, (819871); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (SFB 1432); Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg, FNR, (C19/MS/13624497); Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2017-04828); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (2017-03-022−-19)","N.M. and D.B. acknowledge support from the Luxembourg National Research Fund (Grant No. C19/MS/13624497 ‘ULTRON’).

The established Allen-Feldman and Green-Kubo approaches employ approximations with limited validity—the former neglects anharmonicity, the latter misses the quantum Bose-Einstein statistics of vibrations—and require atomistic models that are very challenging for first-principles methods. Here, we present a protocol to determine from first principles the thermal conductivity κ(T) of glasses above the plateau (i.e., above the temperature-independent region appearing almost without exceptions in the κ(T) of all glasses at cryogenic temperatures). The protocol combines the Wigner formulation of thermal transport with convergence-acceleration techniques, and accounts comprehensively for the effects of structural disorder, anharmonicity, and Bose-Einstein statistics. We validate this approach in vitreous silica, showing that models containing less than 200 atoms can already reproduce κ(T) in the macroscopic limit. We discuss the effects of anharmonicity and the mechanisms determining the trend of κ(T) at high temperature, reproducing experiments at temperatures where radiative effects remain negligible. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Fused silica; Statistical mechanics; Thermal conductivity; Anharmonicities; Atomistic modelling; Bose-Einstein statistics; Complex problems; Cryogenic temperatures; First principle method; First principles; First-principle theory; Green-Kubo approaches; Temperature independents; Glass","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/T022159/1); Gonville and Caius College, University of Cambridge; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (189924, P500PT_203178)","We thank G.

Besides, the range of coupling plays an important role in realizing higher topological indices and transition among them. With a motivation to understand the geometric phases for mixed states, we discuss finite temperature analysis of Hermitian and non-Hermitian topological models with extended range of couplings. To understand the geometric phases for the mixed states, we use Uhlmann phase and discuss the merit-limitation with respect extended range couplings. We extend the finite temperature analysis to non-Hermitian models and define topological invariant for different ranges of coupling. We include the non-Hermitian skin effect, and provide the derivation of topological invariant in the generalized Brillouin zone and their mixed state behavior also.

Making use of the Magnus expansion, we introduce a NMR pulse sequence that generates an average Hamiltonian with Double Quantum terms multiplied by a scaling factor, δ, with the possibility to take positive and negative values. The performance of the pulse sequence for different values of the scaling factors was validated in polycrystalline adamantane, by observing the evolution of the polarization. A time reversal procedure, accessible through the change of sign in the controlled Hamiltonian, was necessary to observe multiple quantum coherences. The spin counting develops a characteristic growth in two species of clusters for the scaled time. The influence of the scaling factor on the reversibility was observed through the behavior of the Loschmidt echoes, which decayed faster as the scaling factor increases. From the analysis of dynamics and its reversibility, we extracted characteristic times for the spin diffusion, T2 δ and the intrinsic decoherence decay, T3 δ for each scaling factor δ, and perturbation time scale, TΣ. Observing the dependence of reversibility vs. perturbation rates, both normalized with the spin diffusion rate, we find that in the limit of low perturbations, T2 δ/T3 δ deviates from the linear dependence on T2 δ/TΣ that corresponds to strong perturbation. The asymptotic value T2/T3≈0.15 as T2 δ/TΣ vanishes, gives evidence that the main source of irreversibility is the intrinsic decoherence associated to the chaotic many-body dynamics of the system. © 2023 The Authors","Decoherence; Double Quantum; Loschmidt echo; Scaling; Spin systems","","","","A.K.

Among 2D nano-magnets, bilayer CrI3 outstands for its antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling and its electrically-mediated magnetic state control. Here, leveraging on CrI3 magnetic and electrical properties, we propose a lateral spin-valve transistor based on bilayer CrI3, where the spin transport is fully controlled via an external electric field. The proposed proof-of-concept device, working in the ballistic regime, is able to both filter (>99%) and select ON/OFF the spin current up to a ratio of ≈102, using a double split-gate architecture.

Key features such as its non-invasive nature and the ability to process information on nuclear spins by versatile quantum control designs with electromagnetic fields, have made NMR to become a powerful technique for sensing systems from atomic and molecular scales with spectroscopy to millimeters in imaging. This brief overview provides quantum sensing tools with which we are contributing from Latin America, by combining quantum dynamical control and estimation strategies with NMR methods to probe physical, chemical, and biological processes. It introduces the basic and key concepts on how controlled spin-sensors can monitor the correlation dynamics of their environment, and selectively and optimally infer its relevant parameters. Then these concepts are illustrated with state-of-the-art implementations for characterizing (i) biological tissue microstructure with diffusion weighting imaging, (ii) quantum information dynamics and scrambling in out-of-equilibrium systems with solid-state NMR quantum simulations, and (iii) molecular structures by selective estimation of spin–spin couplings and online learning control designs with experimental proposals. We expect these concepts will motivate the development of quantum dynamical control of spin sensors to monitor systems in a variety of fields, and in particular to exploit the non-invasive strength of NMR, e.g. in biomedical diagnosis. © 2023 The Author(s)","Diffusion weighted imaging; Dynamics of quantum information; Online learning quantum designs; Quantum decoherence; Quantum sensing","","","","G.A.

Relevant activity and stability, but different selectivities for CO2 reduction or the side H2 evolution were observed.

The interplay between these two fast-growing fields gives rise to a new research frontier of quantum machine learning. In this work, we report an experimental demonstration of training deep quantum neural networks via the backpropagation algorithm with a six-qubit programmable superconducting processor. We experimentally perform the forward process of the backpropagation algorithm and classically simulate the backward process. In particular, we show that three-layer deep quantum neural networks can be trained efficiently to learn two-qubit quantum channels with a mean fidelity up to 96.0% and the ground state energy of molecular hydrogen with an accuracy up to 93.3% compared to the theoretical value. In addition, six-layer deep quantum neural networks can be trained in a similar fashion to achieve a mean fidelity up to 94.8% for learning single-qubit quantum channels. Our experimental results indicate that the number of coherent qubits required to maintain does not scale with the depth of the deep quantum neural network, thus providing a valuable guide for quantum machine learning applications with both near-term and future quantum devices. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Algorithms; Computing Methodologies; Hydrogen; Neural Networks, Computer; Quantum Theory; hydrogen; quantum dot; algorithm; hydrogen; machine learning; quantum mechanics; research work; accuracy; Article; artificial neural network; back propagation; deep neural network; energy; ground state energy; learning; machine learning; quantum chemistry; simulation training; theoretical study; training; algorithm; computer analysis; quantum theory","Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies, (AHY130200); Institute for Guo Qiang; Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11874235, 11874342, 11922411, 11925404, 12061131011, 12075128, 92165209, T2225008); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2019GQG1024, BX2021167); Tsinghua University, THU; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFA0304303); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B0303030001)","We thank Wenjie Jiang for the helpful discussions.

In particular, we demonstrate the appearance of an analogue Zitterbewegung effect, a term which translates as ‘trembling motion’ in English, which was originally proposed for relativistic Dirac electrons and consisted of the oscillations of the centre of mass of a wavepacket in the direction perpendicular to its propagation. For a planar microcavity, we observe regular Zitterbewegung oscillations whose amplitude and period depend on the wavevector of the polaritons. We then extend these results to a honeycomb lattice of coupled microcavity resonators. Compared to the planar cavity, such lattices are inherently more tuneable and versatile, allowing simulation of the Hamiltonians of a wide range of important physical systems. We observe an oscillation pattern related to the presence of the spin-split Dirac cones in the dispersion. In both cases, the experimentally observed oscillations are in good agreement with theoretical modelling and independently measured bandstructure parameters, providing strong evidence for the observation of Zitterbewegung. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Hamiltonians; Honeycomb structures; Microcavities; Phonons; Photons; Wave packets; Photonic microcavities; Planar semiconductors; Polaritonics; Polaritons; Real-space; Relativistics; Semiconductor microcavities; Space propagation; Spin-orbit couplings; Zitterbewegung; Polariton","UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (EP/N031776/1, EP/V026496/1); Science and Technology Facilities Council, STFC, (ST/W006294/1); Icelandic Centre for Research, RANNIS, (163082-051)","This work was supported by UKRI grants EP/V026496/1 and EP/N031776/1.

We test the method on the Heisenberg spin ladder with long entangled boundary between two chains and the results support the Li and Haldane’s conjecture on entanglement spectrum of topological phase. We then explain the conjecture via the wormhole effect in the path integral and show that it can be further generalized for systems beyond gapped topological phases. Our further simulation results on the bilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with 2D entangled boundary across the (2 + 1)D O(3) quantum phase transition clearly demonstrate the correctness of the wormhole picture. Finally, we state that since the wormhole effect amplifies the bulk energy gap by a factor of β, the relative strength of that with respect to the edge energy gap will determine the behavior of low-lying entanglement spectrum of the system. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Argentina; Monaco; Monte; Monte Carlo; boundary line; complexity; energy; phase transition; simulation; spectrum; article; human; human experiment; Monte Carlo method; phase transition; simulation","Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR of China, (17301420, 17301721, 17303019, 17309822, AoE/P-701/20); Westlake University; K.

Recent work has established guarantees for in-distribution generalization of quantum neural networks (QNNs), where training and testing data are drawn from the same data distribution. However, there are currently no results on out-of-distribution generalization in QML, where we require a trained model to perform well even on data drawn from a different distribution to the training distribution. Here, we prove out-of-distribution generalization for the task of learning an unknown unitary. In particular, we show that one can learn the action of a unitary on entangled states having trained only product states. Since product states can be prepared using only single-qubit gates, this advances the prospects of learning quantum dynamics on near term quantum hardware, and further opens up new methods for both the classical and quantum compilation of quantum circuits. © 2023, The Author(s).","","quantum dot; artificial neural network; data interpretation; hardware; machine learning; training; Article; artificial neural network; controlled study; decomposition; learning theory; prediction error; quantum neural network; transfer of learning","Department of Energy Computational Science, (DE-SC0020347); German Academic Scholarship Foundation; PlanQK; Sandoz Family Foundation-Monique de Meuron program for Academic Promotion; TUM Graduate School at the Technical University of Munich; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Advanced Scientific Computing Research, ASCR; Google; Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD, (20210116DR, 20230049DR); Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; Adhesives and Sealant Council, ASC; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz, BMWK; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, DAAD; Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes","We thank Marco Cerezo for helpful conversations.

Accordingly, quantum computers have been predominantly regarded as competitors to only the most accurate and costly classical methods for treating electron correlation. However, here we tighten bounds showing that certain first-quantized quantum algorithms enable exact time evolution of electronic systems with exponentially less space and polynomially fewer operations in basis set size than conventional real-time time-dependent Hartree–Fock and density functional theory. Although the need to sample observables in the quantum algorithm reduces the speedup, we show that one can estimate all elements of the k-particle reduced density matrix with a number of samples scaling only polylogarithmically in basis set size. We also introduce a more efficient quantum algorithm for first-quantized mean-field state preparation that is likely cheaper than the cost of time evolution. We conclude that quantum speedup is most pronounced for finite-temperature simulations and suggest several practically important electron dynamics problems with potential quantum advantage. © 2023, The Author(s).","","algorithm; electron; quantum mechanics; real time; simulation; time dependent behavior; algorithm; article; density functional theory; simulation","National Science Foundation, NSF, (PHY-1748958); Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, KITP; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA, (DE-NA0003525); Sandia National Laboratories, SNL; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP190102633, DP210101367)","The authors thank Alina Kononov, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan, Robin Kothari, Alicia Magann, Fionn Malone, Jarrod McClean, Thomas O’Brien, Nicholas Rubin, Henry Schurkus, Rolando Somma, and Yuan Su for helpful discussions.

Nonetheless, when such a fermionic system is in a pure state, it is subject to additional restrictions known as the generalized Pauli constraints (GPCs). Here we verify experimentally the violation of the GPCs for an open quantum system using data from a superconducting-qubit quantum computer. We prepare states of systems with three-to-seven qubits directly on the quantum device and measure the one-fermion reduced density matrix (1-RDM) from which we can test the GPCs. We find that the GPCs of the 1-RDM are sufficiently sensitive to detect the openness of the 3-to-7 qubit systems in the presence of a single-qubit environment. Results confirm experimentally that the openness of a many-fermion quantum system can be decoded from only a knowledge of the 1-RDM with potential applications from quantum computing and sensing to noise-assisted energy transfer. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Quantum optics; Qubits; Fermionic systems; Fundamental structures; Open quantum systems; Pauli exclusion principle; Pure state; Quanta computers; Quantum device; Reduced-density matrix; State of system; Superconducting qubits; Energy transfer","NSF QuBBE Quantum Leap Challenge Institute; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CHE-2035876, CHE-2155082, OMA-2121044); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Basic Energy Sciences, BES, (DE-SC0019215, DGE-1746045)","Funding text 1: D.A.M. gratefully acknowledges NSF QuBBE Quantum Leap Challenge Institute (NSF OMA-2121044), the U.S. National Science Foundation Grants No. CHE-2155082 and CHE-2035876, and the Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Grant DE-SC0019215.

We also present a set of experimentally realizable walk operations that can implement Grover’s algorithm, quantum Fourier transformation and quantum phase estimation algorithms.

They give rise to virtually all material properties and determine the physics at play in objects ranging from semiconductor devices to the interior of giant gas planets. Modeling and simulation of such diverse applications rely primarily on density functional theory (DFT), which has become the principal method for predicting the electronic structure of matter. While DFT calculations have proven to be very useful, their computational scaling limits them to small systems. We have developed a machine learning framework for predicting the electronic structure on any length scale. It shows up to three orders of magnitude speedup on systems where DFT is tractable and, more importantly, enables predictions on scales where DFT calculations are infeasible. Our work demonstrates how machine learning circumvents a long-standing computational bottleneck and advances materials science to frontiers intractable with any current solutions. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Computation theory; Density functional theory; Forecasting; Machine learning; Semiconductor devices; Density-functional theory calculations; Density-functional-theory; Diverse applications; Electronic.structure; Length scale; Machine-learning; Model and simulation; Property; Scaling limits; Smallest systems; Electronic structure","Alexander Debus; Center for Advanced Systems Understanding; Center for Information Services and High Performance Computing; Saxon state government; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA, (DE-NA0003525); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; Technische Universität Dresden, TUD; Zentrum für Informationsdienste und Hochleistungsrechnen, Technische Universität Dresden, ZIH","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to the Center for Information Services and High Performance Computing [Zentrum für Informationsdienste und Hochleistungsrechnen (ZIH)] at TU Dresden for providing its facilities for high throughput calculations.

While the metallization pressure of helium has been accurately determined, thus far little attention has been paid to the specific mechanisms driving the band-gap closure and electronic properties of this quantum crystal in the terapascal regime (1 TPa = 10 Mbar). Here, we employ density functional theory and many-body perturbation calculations to fill up this knowledge gap. It is found that prior to reaching metallicity helium becomes an excitonic insulator (EI), an exotic state of matter in which electrostatically bound electron-hole pairs may form spontaneously. Furthermore, we predict metallic helium to be a superconductor with a critical temperature of ≈ 20 K just above its metallization pressure and of ≈ 70 K at 100 TPa.

Therefore, it is important to reveal the reasons for the inhibited surface kinetics but still be neglected. Herein, we reveal the mechanism that BiVO4 can’t degrade organics although it is thermodynamically feasible. The surface solvation and formation of double layer (compact layer and diffuse layer) makes low-polarity organics far away from the surface of BiVO4. We found that the introduction of sulfite can solve this problem. Theory calculation illustrates that sulfite can enter into the compact layer because of its higher adsorption energy on BiVO4 and lower adiabatic ionization potential (AIP). Then, photogenerated holes initiate the chain transformation of sulfite and produce strong oxidizing species which can diffuse out to degrade organics. This paper provides an insight into the understand the effects of solid-liquid interface on heterogeneously photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Charge transfer; Ionization of gases; Ionization potential; Organic pollutants; Phase interfaces; Breakings; Compact layer; Double layers; Interfacial charge transfer; Organics; Photocatalytic systems; Pollutant degradation; Surface formation; Surface kinetics; Surface solvation; adsorption; aqueous solution; catalysis; degradation; ionization; organic pollutant; photochemistry; sulfite; thermodynamics; Bismuth compounds","Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, (KYCX22_0680); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51979081, 52100179); Science Fund for Creative Research Groups, (51421006); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (B200202103); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, PAPD","We are grateful for grants from the Natural Science Foundation of China (51979081, 52100179), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(B200202103), National Science Funds for Creative Research Groups of China (No. 51421006), PAPD, and Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (KYCX22_0680).

We realized that the electron density distribution is strongly localized along B-N bonds when there is a strong attractive force between the dopant’s atoms; however, when there is a lesser attractive force, the electrons are delocalized over the B-N bond of the hexagonal graphene ring. The molecular dynamic simulation is done to determine the thermal stability of the nanosheets. Additionally, since graphene is made up of a hexagonal structure, the locations of B or N atoms in para-, meta-, and ortho-positions are more sensitive. Furthermore, the symmetry of spin up and spin down of the band structure show that these monolayers are nonmagnetic materials. Moreover, we employed Phonopy software to demonstrate the specific heat capacity of the monolayers from 0 K to 1000 K, which is in the high-temperature limit. Based on our estimations, the BN-codoped graphene monolayers are beneficial in thermoelectric and optoelectronic devices. © University of Garmian.

By applying a blue-detuned microwave driving field, we obtain an effective Hamiltonian where the magnon mode acting as an engineered resevoir cools the Bogoliubov modes of microwave cavity mode and mechanical mode via a beam-splitter-like interaction. By this means, the microwave cavity mode and mechanical mode can be driven to a two-mode squeezed state in the stationary limit. Particularly, strong two-way and one-way photon-phonon asymmetric quantum steering can be obtained with even equal dissipation. It is widely divergent with the conventional proposal, where additional unbalanced losses or noises should be imposed on the two subsystems. Our finding may be significant to expand our understanding of the essential physics of asymmetric steering and extend the potential application of the cavity spintronics to device-independent quantum key distribution. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Hamiltonians; Phonons; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum optics; Bogoliubov modes; Cavity mode; Detuned; Driving field; Effective Hamiltonian; Magnon modes; Mechanical; Microwave cavity; Two ways; Two-mode squeezed state; Photons","Zhejiang Gongshang University, ZJSU; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12004336, 12075205, 62071430); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LQ21A040007)","We acknowledge supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 12004336, No. 12075205, and No. 62071430), the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province of China under Grants No. LQ21A040007, and funds from Zhejiang Gongshang University.

However, the quantitative relation between this entanglement and the fringe visibility remains untouched upon for an initial mixed state. Here we find an equality for quantifying this relation. Our equality characterizes how well the interference pattern can be preserved when an interfering particle, initially carrying a definite amount of coherence, is entangled, to a certain degree, with a which-path detector. This equality provides a connection between entanglement and interference in the unified framework of coherence, revealing the quantitative entanglement-interference complementarity. We experimentally demonstrate this relation with a superconducting circuit, where a resonator serves as a which-path detector for an interfering qubit. The measured fringe visibility of the qubit’s Ramsey signal and the qubit-resonator entanglement exhibit a complementary relation, in well agreement with the theoretical prediction. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Superconducting resonators; Visibility; Complementary relation; Experimental demonstrations; Fringe visibilities; Interference patterns; Mixed state; Path informations; Quantitative relations; Superconducting circuit; Unified framework; Timing circuits","Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0300200); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11875108, 11934018, 12264040, 12274080, 92065114, T2121001, U21A20436); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDB28000000); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (Z200009); Fuzhou University, FZU, (049050011050, JG202001-2); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B0303030001)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 12274080, No. 11875108, No. 11934018, No. 92065114, No. T2121001, No. 12264040, and No. U21A20436), Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology (Grant No. 2021ZD0300200), the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDB28000000), the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province, China (Grant No. 2020B0303030001), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. Z200009), and Project from Fuzhou University under (Grant No. JG202001-2, No. 049050011050).

The choice of the short-range Fock exchange fraction and the screening length can further reduce the predicted error. We then propose a universal expression for the selection of the inverse screening parameter as a function of the short-range and long-range Fock exchange fractions, which results in a mean absolute error as small as 0.15 eV for band gap prediction. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Forecasting; Hybrid materials; Accurate prediction; Dielectric screening; Extended systems; Hybrid functionals; In-band; Mean absolute error; Performance; Predicted error; Screening lengths; Universal expressions; Energy gap","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; National Supercomputing Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, KSC, (s1122)","Funding text 1: This work is supported by Grant No. 200020-152799 of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF).

Here we propose a realistic scheme for Rydberg atom array experiments in which a Z2 gauge structure with dynamical charges emerges on experimentally relevant timescales from only local two-body interactions and one-body terms in two spatial dimensions. The scheme enables the experimental study of a variety of models, including (2 + 1)D Z2 lattice gauge theories coupled to different types of dynamical matter and quantum dimer models on the honeycomb lattice, for which we derive effective Hamiltonians. We discuss ground-state phase diagrams of the experimentally most relevant effective Z2 lattice gauge theories with dynamical matter featuring various confined and deconfined, quantum spin liquid phases. Further, we present selected probes with immediate experimental relevance, including signatures of disorder-free localization and a thermal deconfinement transition of two charges. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Gages; Ground state; Lattice theory; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Atom arrays; Condensed-matter physics; Gauge fields; Gauge structure; Large-scales; Lattice gauge theory; Quantum simulations; Quantum simulators; Rydberg atoms; Time-scales; Honeycomb structures","Optical Physics at Harvard University; National Science Foundation, NSF; Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-20-1-0163); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (948141); European Research Council, ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (277974659, EXC-2111—390814868); Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes","We thank M.

However, the proof of principle demonstration of spin-charge separation is yet to be accomplished for realistic, ab initio band structures of spin-orbit-coupled materials, lacking spin-conservation law. In this work, we perform thought experiments with magnetic flux tubes on β -bismuthene, and demonstrate spin-charge separation, and quantized pumping of spin for three insulating states, that can be accessed by tuning filling fractions. With a combined analysis of momentum-space topology and real-space response, we identify important role of bands supporting even integer invariants, which cannot be addressed with symmetry-based indicators. Our work sets a new standard for the computational diagnosis of two-dimensional, quantum spin-Hall materials by going beyond the Z2 paradigm and providing an avenue for precise determination of the bulk invariant through computation of quantized, real-space response. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Motion; article; magnetic field; motion","National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMR-1720139, PHY-1607611); Northwestern University, NU","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation MRSEC program (DMR-1720139) at the Materials Research Center of Northwestern University, and the start up funds of P.

Existing proposals combining fast oscillator-mediated gates with dynamical decoupling require strong pulses or fast control over the qubit-boson coupling. Here, we present a method based on dynamical decoupling techniques that leads to faster-than-dispersive entanglement gates with low-intensity pulses. Our method is general, i.e., it is applicable to any quantum platform that has qubits interacting with bosonic mediators via longitudinal coupling. Moreover, the protocol provides robustness to fluctuations in qubit frequencies and control fields, while also being resistant to common errors such as frequency shifts and heating in the mediator as well as crosstalk effects. We illustrate our method with an implementation for trapped ions coupled via magnetic field gradients. With detailed numerical simulations, we show that entanglement gates with infidelities of 10−3 or 10−4 are possible with current or near-future experimental setups, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Bosons; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Bosonic modes; Decoupling technique; Dynamical decoupling; Fast control; Intensity pulse; Low-intensity; Phase gates; Pulse control; Quantum technologies; Qubit-qubit interactions; Trapped ions","Dispositivos en Tecnologías Cuánticas, (KK-2022/00062); European Union’s Horizon2020 research and innovation programme, (899354); Ramón y Cajal, (RYC2018-025197-I); Spanish Government, (828826, EUR2020-112117, PID2021-126694NB-C21); Eusko Jaurlaritza, (IT1470-22)","I.A. would like to thank P.

By using X-ray diffraction, the occurrence of PbTe is detected, while the PbTe formation and morphology, during milling, are studied via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). According to TEM results, the occurrence of nearly spherical and faceted PbTe QDs are ruled by highly structural-defect and oriented attachment mechanisms, respectively. What is more, mechanical kneading is effectively inhibited when 3 wt% TBP is added during milling. Dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations are carried out to understand the factors that affect growth and morphology of PbTe QDs. DFT results demonstrated that both the intrinsic characteristics of PbTe and the adsorption of certain reaction species are responsible for the shape control of PbTe QDs, which is useful to propose adsorption modes of TBF on PbTe surface and to rationalize the facets exposed by PbTe after the surface treatment. In agreement with experimental results, Wulff constructions proposed are cube-like quantum dots with sharp edges, but rounded edges are possible as well. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","DFT; PbTe; Process control agent; Quantum dots","High resolution transmission electron microscopy; IV-VI semiconductors; Lead compounds; Milling (machining); Morphology; Nanocrystals; Phosphates; Process control; Semiconductor quantum dots; Surface treatment; Tellurium compounds; Density-functional-theory; Experimental approaches; Milling time; Oriented attachment; Process control agents; Quantum dot; Structural defect; Theoretical approach; Tributyl phosphate; X- ray diffractions; Density functional theory","Sistema Nacional de Investigadores, SNI","The author appreciates the support provided by the DIMPROD group.

Many of these physics are characterized by band structures in more than one dimensions. Existing efforts on band structure measurements in the photonic synthetic frequency dimension however are limited to either one-dimensional Brillouin zones or one-dimensional subsets of multi-dimensional Brillouin zones. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a method to fully measure multi-dimensional band structures in the synthetic frequency dimension. We use a single photonic resonator under dynamical modulation to create a multi-dimensional synthetic frequency lattice. We show that the band structure of such a lattice over the entire multi-dimensional Brillouin zone can be measured by introducing a gauge potential into the lattice Hamiltonian. Using this method, we perform experimental measurements of two-dimensional band structures of a Hermitian and a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The measurements reveal some of the general properties of point-gap topology of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in more than one dimensions. Our results demonstrate experimental capabilities to fully characterize high-dimensional physical phenomena in the photonic synthetic frequency dimension. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Hamiltonians; Brillouin zones; Frequency dimensions; Lattice Hamiltonians; Measurements of; Multi dimensional; Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians; One dimension; One-dimensional; Structure measurement; Structure spectroscopy; Band structure","Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-18-1-0379, FA9550-22-1-0339); Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative, MURI","We thank Professor David A.

To fully harness these properties, EPs must retain ballistic, coherent transport despite matter-mediated interactions with lattice phonons. Here we develop a nonlinear momentum-resolved optical approach that directly images EPs in real space on femtosecond scales in a range of polaritonic architectures. We focus our analysis on EP propagation in layered halide perovskite microcavities. We reveal that EP–phonon interactions lead to a large renormalization of EP velocities at high excitonic fractions at room temperature. Despite these strong EP–phonon interactions, ballistic transport is maintained for up to half-exciton EPs, in agreement with quantum simulations of dynamic disorder shielding through light-matter hybridization. Above 50% excitonic character, rapid decoherence leads to diffusive transport. Our work provides a general framework to precisely balance EP coherence, velocity, and nonlinear interactions. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Diagnostic Imaging; Diffusion; Hybridization, Genetic; Motion; Phonons; energy flow; halide; instrumentation; performance assessment; perovskite; article; phonon; room temperature; simulation; velocity; diagnostic imaging; diffusion; hybridization; motion","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CHE-1954791, CHE-2203844, DMR-2115625); Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation, AMBF; Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Harvard University, MRSEC, (1836650, 2030508, ACI-1548562, DMR-2011738, TG-CHE210085)","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Numbers DMR-2115625 (M.D.) and CHE-1954791 (D.R.R.).

Here we report unusual CDW associated with the higher-order FS nesting in monolayer 2D VS2. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy uncovered stripe CDW with 21R10.9∘×3R30∘ periodicity together with an energy-gap opening on the entire FS. We suggest that this CDW involves the higher-order FS-nesting vector 2q twice larger than that of the normal one (q), as supported by the anomalies in the calculated phonon dispersion and electronic susceptibility. The present results suggest that the cooperation of q and 2q nesting leads to the fully gapped CDW state unlike the case of conventional single q nesting which produces a partial gap, pointing to an intriguing mechanism of CDW transition. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Charge density; Fermi surface; Monolayers; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Scanning tunneling microscopy; Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy; Charge-density-waves; Electronic instabilities; Fermi surface nesting; Gap opening; High-order; Higher-order; One-dimensional materials; Peierls; Two-dimensional; Charge density waves","Advanced Institute for Materials Research; GP-Spin at Tohoku University; KEK-PF, (2020G669, 2021S2-001, 2022G007); World Premier International Research Center; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP18H01821, JP20H01847, JP20H04624, JP21H01757, JP21H04435, JP21K18888, JP22J13724); Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, CREST, (JPMJCR18T1); Foundation for Promotion of Material Science and Technology of Japan, MST; Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology, PRESTO, (JPMJPR20A8)","We thank C.-W.

For short interatomic separations and limited signal-to-noise ratio, this task becomes increasingly challenging. Common methods rapidly decline in performance as the lattice spacing is decreased below half the imaging resolution. Here, we present an algorithm based on deep convolutional neural networks to reconstruct the site-resolved lattice occupation with high fidelity. The algorithm can be directly trained in an unsupervised fashion with experimental fluorescence images and allows for a fast reconstruction of large images containing several thousand lattice sites. We benchmark its performance using a quantum gas microscope with cesium atoms that utilizes short-spaced optical lattices with lattice constant 383.5 nm and a typical Rayleigh resolution of 850 nm. We obtain promising reconstruction fidelities ≳ 96% across all fillings based on a statistical analysis. We anticipate this algorithm to enable novel experiments with shorter lattice spacing, boost the readout fidelity and speed of lower-resolution imaging systems, and furthermore find application in related experiments such as trapped ions. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Benchmarking; Deep neural networks; Gases; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Learning algorithms; Signal to noise ratio; Trapped ions; Convolutional neural network; Fast reconstruction; Fluorescence image; High-fidelity; Imaging resolutions; Interatomic separation; Lattice spacing; Performance; Quantum gas; Single sites; Optical lattices","Bavarian excellence network ENB; German Academic Scholarship Foundation; Marianne-Plehn-Program; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (897142); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (277974659, EXC-2111 - 390814868); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (13N15895 FermiQP); Hector Fellow Academy; Munich Center for Quantum Science and Technology, MCQST, (390814868, EXC-2111)","The authors would like to thank Christian Schweizer for their contributions to the early stages of this experiment and Annabelle Bohrdt for helpful discussions on machine learning architectures.

Recently, QEs in two-dimensional semiconductors have attracted great interest as promising quantum light sources. However, whether those QEs are characterized by the same valley physics as delocalized valley excitons is still under debate. Moreover, the potential applications of such QEs still need to be explored. Here we show experimental evidence of valley symmetry breaking for neutral QEs in WSe2 monolayer by interacting with chiral plasmonic nanocavities. The anomalous magneto-optical behaviour of the coupled QEs suggests that the polarization state of emitted photon is modulated by the chiral nanocavity instead of the valley-dependent optical selection rules. Calculations of cavity quantum electrodynamics further show the absence of intrinsic valley polarization. The cavity-dependent circularly polarized single-photon output also offers a strategy for future applications in chiral quantum optics. © 2023, The Author(s).","","angular momentum; electrodynamics; physics; polarization; quantum mechanics; symmetry; valley; article; calculation; chirality; photon; polarization; quantum optics","Strategic Priority Research Program, (XDB28000000); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11721404, 11934019, 12174437, 12204020, 62025507, 62175254, 92250301); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2022M710234); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFA1400700)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2021YFA1400700), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants Nos. 62025507, 11934019, 92250301, 11721404, 62175254, 12174437, and 12204020), the Strategic Priority Research Program (Grant No. XDB28000000) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2022M710234).

They can be caused by multiple factors such as the expressivity of the ansatz, excessive entanglement, the locality of observables under consideration, or even hardware noise. We propose classical splitting of parametric ansatz circuits to avoid barren plateaus. Classical splitting is realized by subdividing an N qubit ansatz into multiple ansätze that consist of O(log N) qubits. We show that such an approach allows for avoiding barren plateaus and carry out numerical experiments, and perform binary classification on classical and quantum datasets. Moreover, we propose an extension of the ansatz that is compatible with variational quantum simulations. Finally, we discuss a speed-up for gradient-based optimization and hardware implementation, robustness against noise and parallelization, making classical splitting an ideal tool for noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) applications. © 2023, The Author(s).","Ansatz; Barren; Parametric; Plateau","Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Quantum chemistry; Quantum optics; Qubits; Ansatz; Barren; Large-scales; N qubits; Parametric; Plateau; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum system; Splittings; Timing circuits","Future-proofing Scientific Applications for the Supercomputers of Tomorrow; Ministry of Science, Research and Culture of the State of Brandenburg; Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics, FAST, (COMPLEMENTARY/0916/0048, EXCELLENCE/0421/0019); HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme, (101087126); Helmholtz Association; Research and Innovation Foundation, RIF","C.T. and A.C. are supported in part by the Helmholtz Association - “Innopool Project Variational Quantum Computer Simulations (VQCS)”.

Non-volatile memory technologies, particularly magnetic random-access memories (MRAMs), characterized by 2D materials are the goal of the effort. A sufficiently large spin current density is indispensable for the writing mode of MRAMs to switch states. How to attain spin current density beyond critical values around 5 MA/cm2 in 2D materials at room temperature is the greatest obstacle to overcome. Here, we first theoretically propose a spin valve based on graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) to generate a huge spin current density at room temperature. The spin current density can achieve the critical value with the help of tunable gate voltage. The highest spin current density can reach 15 MA/cm2 by adjusting the band gap energy of GNRs and exchange strength in our proposed gate-tunable spin-valve. Also, ultralow writing power can be obtained, successfully overcoming the difficulties traditional magnetic tunnel junction-based MRAMs have faced. Furthermore, the proposed spin-valve meets the reading mode criteria and the MR ratios are always higher than 100%. These results may open the feasibility avenues for spin logic devices based on 2D materials. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (111-2221-E-002-194, MOST 110-2221-E-002-176)","The authors acknowledge the support provided by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, under Grant Number MOST 110-2221-E-002-176 and 111-2221-E-002-194.

In this work, we investigate the practical advantage of quantum machine learning in ghost imaging by overcoming the limitations of classical methods in blind object identification and imaging. We propose two hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithms and a physical-inspired patch strategy to allow distributed quantum learning with parallel variational circuits. In light of the algorithm, we conduct experiments for imaging-free object identification and blind ghost imaging under different physical sampling rates. We further quantitatively analyze the advantage through the lens of information geometry and generalization capability. The numerical results showcase that quantum machine learning can restore high-quality images but classical machine learning fails. The advantage of identification rate are up to 10% via fair comparison with the classical machine learning methods.

Based on the existing 2D superconducting-qubit lattices, we construct a generalized Hofstadter model on zigzag lattices, which has a fractal energy spectrum similar to the original Hofstadter butterfly. By periodically modulating the resonant frequencies of qubits, we engineer a synthetic gauge field to mimic the generalized Hofstadter Hamiltonian. A spectroscopic method is used to demonstrate the Hofstadter butterfly from the time evolutions of experimental observables. We numerically simulate the dynamics of the system with realistic parameters, and the results show a butterfly spectrum clearly. Our proposal provides a promising way to realize the Hofstadter butterfly on the latest 2D superconducting-qubit lattices and will stimulate the quantum simulation of novel properties induced by magnetic fields in superconducting circuits.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2023, Higher Education Press.","quantum computation; quantum simulation; superconducting circuits; superconducting qubit","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11774076, 12204138, 12204139, 12205069, U20A2076, U21A20436); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2018B030326001)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 12204139, U20A2076, 12204138, 12205069, 11774076, and U21A20436) and the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (Grant No. 2018B030326001).

Besides providing fundamental insights into how enthalpic, entropic, and nuclear quantum effects shape the free-energy landscape of water, we demonstrate that recent progress in “first principles” data-driven simulations, which rigorously encode many-body molecular interactions, has opened the door to realistic computational studies of complex molecular systems, bridging the gap between experiments and simulations. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Entropy; Thermodynamics; Water; ice; water; algorithm; enthalpy; entropy; experimental study; simulation; thermodynamics; aqueous solution; Article; complex formation; computer simulation; deep neural network; gold standard; heat; intermethod comparison; liquid; melting point; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; molecular stability; motion; prediction; quantum mechanics; quantum theory; thermodynamics; algorithm; chemistry; computer simulation; entropy","Carlos Vega and Venkat Kapil; Department of Defense High Performance Computing Modernization Program; Flatiron Institute; HPCMP; Triton Shared Computing Cluster; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1548562, 2137603, 2138259, 2138286, 2138296, 2138307); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-20-1-0351); Simons Foundation, SF","Funding text 1: We are grateful to Pablo Piaggi for his aid in setting up the environments, including both oxygen and hydrogen atoms, for the enhanced-coexistence simulations involving ice II.

Here, using a programmable quantum processor with a chain of 10 superconducting qubits interacted through tunable couplers, we simulate the one-dimensional generalized Aubry-André-Harper model for three different phases, i.e., extended, localized and critical phases. The properties of phase transitions and many-body dynamics are studied in the presence of quasi-periodic modulations for both off-diagonal hopping coefficients and on-site potentials of the model controlled respectively by adjusting strength of couplings and qubit frequencies. We observe the spin transport for initial single- and multi-excitation states in different phases, and characterize phase transitions by experimentally measuring dynamics of participation entropies. Our experimental results demonstrate that the recently developed tunable coupling architecture of superconducting processor extends greatly the simulation realms for a wide variety of Hamiltonians, and can be used to study various quantum and topological phenomena. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Quantum chemistry; Quantum optics; Qubits; Spin dynamics; Controllable quantum system; Critical phasis; Harper model; Many-body systems; Non equilibrium; Quantum processors; Quantum simulations; Superconducting circuit; Superconducting qubits; Tunable couplers; Timing circuits","Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2-6); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11904393, 11934018, 12047502, 12275213, 92065114, T2121001); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDB28000000); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (YJKYYQ20200041, Z200009); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFA0304300); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2018B030326001, 2020B0303030001)","We thank Zheng-Hang Sun and Shang-Shu Li for valuable discussions.

Here, we report a carbene molecule on a copper surface as a prototype of an anchored molecule with a facile chirality change. We examine the influence of the attractive van der Waals interactions on the chirality change by regulating the tip-molecule distance, resulting in an excess of a carbene enantiomer. Our model study provides insight into the change of molecular chirality controlled by van der Waals interactions, which is fundamental for understanding the mechanisms of chiral induction and amplification. © 2023, The Author(s).","","carbene; copper; hydrogen; chemical bonding; hydrogen; molecular analysis; adsorption; Article; chirality; controlled study; covalent bond; density functional theory; electric potential; enantiomer; feedback system; heating; low temperature; molecular interaction; scanning tunneling spectroscopy; surface property; van der waals interaction","Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, AvH; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (GRK2376//331085229); Ruhr-Universität Bochum, RUB","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy-EXC-2033-390677874 RESOLV, and by the Research Training Group ‘Confinement-Controlled Chemistry’, which is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under GRK2376//331085229.

Notably, an algorithm pursuing the goal of an efficient and robust convergence procedure for GW and BSE simulations is provided, together with its implementation in a fully automated framework. This is accompanied by an automatic GW band interpolation scheme based on maximally localized Wannier functions, aiming at a reduction of the computational burden of quasiparticle band structures while preserving high accuracy.

Yet, a direct experimental realization is hampered by the particles large rest mass resulting in high potential barrier. Here, for non-Hermitian antiferromagnets, at the verge of the anti-parity-time symmetry transition, chiral magnons are demonstrated to offer a bosonic platform to access Klein tunneling at meV energies in experimentally feasible settings. Our analytical and numerical simulations evidence that magnetic damping renders a low energy mechanism for the breakdown of the magnonic vacuum and for creating particle-antiparticle pairs in strong magnetic fields. Adopting Feynman’s picture for antiparticles, the tunneling time of an incident magnon wave packet across a supercritical barrier is found to be negative. The uncovered aspects point to the potential of chiral magnons for addressing fundamental physics in a conceptually simple setup with the potential for use in chirality-dependent magnonic computing. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Antiferromagnetic materials; Quantum theory; Relativity; Antiferromagnets; Breakings; Klein Tunneling; Magnons; Pair production; Paritytime symmetries; Particle-antiparticle pair; Potential barriers; Quantum field theory; Relativistic particles; Computation theory","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (465098690, SFB TRR 227); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11834005, 12174164, 91963201); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project, (B2006)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 12174164, 91963201, and 11834005), the German Research Foundation (SFB TRR 227, and Nr. 465098690), and the 111 Project under Grant No. B2006.

This interface-free current generation mechanism, referred to as the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), does not rely on p-n junctions. Here, we explore the shift current generation, a major mechanism responsible for the BPVE, in single-element two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics represented by phosphorene-like monolayers of As, Sb, and Bi. The strong covalency, small band gap, and large joint density of states afforded by these elemental 2D materials give rise to large shift currents, outperforming many state-of-the-art materials. We find that the shift current, due to its topological nature, depends sensitively on the details of the Bloch wave functions. It is crucial to consider the electronic exchange-correlation potential beyond the generalized gradient approximation as well as the spin-orbit interaction in density functional theory calculations to obtain reliable frequency-dependent shift current responses. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Density functional theory; Energy gap; Ferroelectric materials; Monolayers; Semiconductor junctions; Wave functions; 'current; Bulk materials; Current generation; Current response; Direct-current; Generation mechanism; Inversion symmetry; P-n junction; Single element; Two-dimensional; Photovoltaic effects","Westlake Education Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11974270)","Funding text 1: Z.Q. and S.L. acknowledge the supports from Westlake Education Foundation.

A critical challenge for VQE in practice is that one needs to strike a balance between the expressivity of the VQE ansatz versus the number of quantum gates required to implement the ansatz, given the reality of noisy quantum operations on near-term quantum computers. In this work, we consider an orbital-optimized pair-correlated approximation to the unitary coupled cluster with singles and doubles (uCCSD) ansatz and report a highly efficient quantum circuit implementation for trapped-ion architectures. We show that orbital optimization can recover significant additional electron correlation energy without sacrificing efficiency through measurements of low-order reduced density matrices (RDMs). In the dissociation of small molecules, the method gives qualitatively accurate predictions in the strongly-correlated regime when running on noise-free quantum simulators. On IonQ’s Harmony and Aria trapped-ion quantum computers, we run end-to-end VQE algorithms with up to 12 qubits and 72 variational parameters—the largest full VQE simulation with a correlated wave function on quantum hardware. We find that even without error mitigation techniques, the predicted relative energies across different molecular geometries are in excellent agreement with noise-free simulators. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Electronic structure; Numerical methods; Quantum optics; Qubits; Variational techniques; Wave functions; Correlated electrons; Coupled clusters; Critical challenges; Eigensolvers; Electronic.structure; Orbitals; Quanta computers; Quantum gates; Quantum operations; Trapped ion; Trapped ions","Hyundai Motor Company","We thank the Hyundai Motor Company for funding this research through the Hyundai-IonQ Joint Quantum Computing Research Project.

Einstein’s theory of space and time allows for spacetime singularities and Van Hove singularities arise in condensed matter physics, while intensity, phase and polarization singularities pervade wave physics. Within dissipative systems governed by matrices, singularities occur at the exceptional points in parameter space whereby some eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce simultaneously. However, the nature of exceptional points arising in quantum systems described within an open quantum systems approach has been much less studied. Here we consider a quantum oscillator driven parametrically and subject to loss. This squeezed system exhibits an exceptional point in the dynamical equations describing its first and second moments, which acts as a borderland between two phases with distinctive physical consequences. In particular, we discuss how the populations, correlations, squeezed quadratures and optical spectra crucially depend on being above or below the exceptional point. We also remark upon the presence of a dissipative phase transition at a critical point, which is associated with the closing of the Liouvillian gap. Our results invite the experimental probing of quantum resonators under two-photon driving, and perhaps a reappraisal of exceptional and critical points within dissipative quantum systems more generally. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Accidental Injuries; Asthma; Humans; Phase Transition; Photons; Physical Examination; accidental injury; asthma; human; phase transition; photon; physical examination","Royal Society, (RGS/R1 /211220, URF/R1/201158); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (465469/2014-0)","CAD is supported by the Royal Society via a University Research Fellowship (URF/R1/201158) and a Royal Society Research Grant (RGS/R1 /211220).

Recently, a generic early-time deviation from RMT, so-called the ‘bump’, was shown to exist in random quantum circuits as toy models for many-body quantum systems. We demonstrate the existence of ‘bump-ramp-plateau’ behavior in the SFF for a number of paradigmatic and stroboscopically-driven 1D cold-atom models: spinless and spin-1/2 Bose-Hubbard models, and nonintegrable spin-1 condensate with contact or dipolar interactions. We find that the scaling of the many-body Thouless time t Th —the onset of RMT—, and the bump amplitude are more sensitive to variations in atom number than the lattice size regardless of the hyperfine structure, the symmetry classes, or the choice of driving protocol. Moreover, t Th scaling and the increase of the bump amplitude in atom number are significantly slower in spinor gases than interacting bosons in 1D optical lattices, demonstrating the role of locality. We obtain universal scaling functions of SFF which suggest power-law behavior for the bump regime in quantum chaotic cold-atom systems, and propose an interference measurement protocol. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Atoms; Crystal lattices; Hubbard model; Optical lattices; Quantum chaos; Quantum optics; Random variables; Atom numbers; Cold atoms; Form factors; Many body; Quantum chaos; Quantum chaotic systems; Random matrices theory; Scalings; Spectral correlation function; Time deviation; Chaotic systems","National Science Foundation, NSF; Princeton University, PU; Harvard University","The authors thank Soonwon Choi, Bertrand Evrard, Wen-Wei Ho, David Huse, Di Luo, Minh Tran, Norman Yao, Sina Zeytinoglu and Peter Zoller for stimulating discussions.

The underlying boundary states however remain largely unexplored. This is related with a fundamental issue how a Kondo cloud spatially forms to screen a magnetic impurity in a metal. Here we predict the quantum-coherent spatial and energy structure of multichannel Kondo clouds, representative boundary states involving competing non-Fermi liquids, by studying quantum entanglement between the impurity and the channels. Entanglement shells of distinct non-Fermi liquids coexist in the structure, depending on the channels. As temperature increases, the shells become suppressed one by one from the outside, and the remaining outermost shell determines the thermal phase of each channel. Detection of the entanglement shells is experimentally feasible. Our findings suggest a guide to studying other boundary states and boundary-bulk entanglement. © 2023, The Author(s).","","boundary condition; experimental study; liquid; quantum mechanics; article","Korea NRF; SRC Center for Quantum Coherence in Condensed Matter, (2016R1A5A1008184, 2022R1A6A3A13062095, 2023R1A2C2003430, RS-2023-00207732)","We thank Frederic Pierre and Jan von Delft for useful discussions.

The most studied defects in La-based perovskites are the oxygen vacancies and doping impurities on the La and M sites. Here, we identify that intrinsic antisite defects, the replacement of La by the transition metal, M, can be formed under M-rich and O-poor growth conditions, based on results of an accurate many-body ab initio approach. Our fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FNDMC) calculations of LaMO 3 (M = Mn , Fe, and Co) find that such antisite defects can have low formation energies and are magnetized. Complementary density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations show that Mn antisite defects in LaMnO 3 may cause the p-type electronic conductivity. These features could affect spintronics, redox catalysis, and other broad applications. Our bulk validation studies establish that FNDMC reproduces the antiferromagnetic state of LaMnO 3, whereas DFT with PBE (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof), SCAN (strongly constrained and appropriately normed), and the LDA+U (local density approximation with Coulomb U) functionals all favor ferromagnetic states, at variance with experiment. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","Compute and Data Environment for Science; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC, (DE-AC02-06CH11357); Basic Energy Sciences, BES; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL; Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering, DMSE, (DE-AC05-00OR22725)","Funding text 1: This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC, under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the US Department of Energy (DOE).

In this work, we develop a database of sulfur K-edge XAS spectra of crystalline and amorphous lithium thiophosphate materials based on the atomic structures reported in Chem. Mater., 34, 6702 (2022). The XAS database is based on simulations using the excited electron and core-hole pseudopotential approach implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package. Our database contains 2681 S K-edge XAS spectra for 66 crystalline and glassy structure models, making it the largest collection of first-principles computational XAS spectra for glass/ceramic lithium thiophosphates to date. This database can be used to correlate S spectral features with distinct S species based on their local coordination and short-range ordering in sulfide-based solid electrolytes. The data is openly distributed via the Materials Cloud, allowing researchers to access it for free and use it for further analysis, such as spectral fingerprinting, matching with experiments, and developing machine learning models. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","New York State Empire State Development; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (1G20RR030893-01); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST; Office of Science, SC; Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL; Columbia University; Wind Energy Technologies Office, WETO, (DE-SC0012704); Empire State Development's Division of Science, Technology and Innovation, NYSTAR, (C090171)","Funding text 1: We acknowledge financial support by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Vehicle Technologies Office, Contract No. DE-SC0012704.

Through ab-initio simulation techniques, we shed light on the fundamental physics and screen several 2D and 3D top and side contact metals. Our findings highlight that a low semiconducting-metal contact resistance can be achieved. By selecting an appropriate 2D metal, we demonstrate both ohmic or small Schottky barrier top and side contacts. This leads to a contact resistance below 100 Ωμm and good device drive performance with currents in ON state up to 1400 μA/μm, i.e., reduced by a mere 25% compared to a reference with perfect ohmic contacts, provided a sufficiently high doping concentration of 1.8×1013cm−2 is used. Additionally, we show that this doping concentration can be achieved through electrostatic doping with a gate. Finally, we perform a screening of possible 2D–3D top contacts. Finding an ohmic 2D–3D contact without a Schottky barrier has proven difficult, but it is shown that for the case of intermediate interaction strength and a limited Schottky barrier, contact resistances below 100 Ωμm can be achieved. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Ohmic contacts; Schottky barrier diodes; Semiconductor doping; Ab initio; Ab initio simulations; Contact forms; Doping concentration; Fundamental physics; Metal contacts; Scaled devices; Schottky barriers; Semiconductor metals; Simulation technique; Contact resistance","Albert de Jamblinne de Meux; Kiroubanand Sankaran; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the FWO as part of the PhD fellowship 1100321N.

However, more developments are still needed for better preparation of isolated few-spin systems. In this work, we demonstrate a highly nonlinear spin-discriminating (HNSD) method for isolating an arbitrary few-level manifold out of a larger total number of spin ground states in fermionic alkaline-earth atoms. With this method, we realize large and tunable energy shifts for unwanted spin states while inducing negligible shifts for the spin states of interest, which leads to a highly isolated few-spin system under minimal perturbation. Furthermore, the isolated few-spin system exhibits a long lifetime on the hundred-millisecond scale. Using the HNSD method, we demonstrate a characteristic Rabi oscillation between the two states of an isolated two-spin Fermi gas. Our method has wide applicability for realizing long-lived two-spin or high-spin quantum systems based on alkaline-earth fermions.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2023, Higher Education Press.","a.c.

Unlike atomic-scale Hubbard systems or Moiré materials, where electronic correlations are either localized or long-ranged, pristine flat band systems with short-range interactions that do not break symmetry spontaneously are less known and intriguing. These systems could bridge the gap between atomic Mott insulators and Moiré correlated insulators, offering a unique platform to explore their mysterious relation. Using an analytical analysis, further verified by numerical calculations, we show that monolayer Nb3Cl8 is a unique flat band system with short-range interactions. We present clear evidence that it is a cluster Mott insulator, which nicely explains the electronic structure observed in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We further propose that monolayer Nb3Cl8 may constitute a rare example of molecular quantum spin liquid with flat bands. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Chlorine compounds; Electronic structure; Monolayers; Niobium compounds; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Quantum theory; Atomic scale; Band systems; Electronic correlation; Flat band; Hubbard systems; Long range orders; Mott insulators; Quantum spin liquid; Short range interactions; Spin liquid state; Mott insulators","Postdoctoral Special Funds for Theoretical Physics, (12147124); School of Physical Science and Technology; Shanghai Technology Innovation Action Plan, (20DZ1100605, M-0006); ShanghaiTech University Library and Information Services; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11874263, 21JC1404700); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFA1402703)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2022YFA1402703), National Natural Science Foundation of China (11874263), Shanghai 2021-Fundamental Research Area (21JC1404700), Shanghai Technology Innovation Action Plan (20DZ1100605), and Sino-German Mobility program (M-0006).

We present a shell-model quantum circuit design strategy to find nuclear ground states by exploiting an adaptive variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. Our circuit implementation is in excellent agreement with classical shell-model simulations for a dozen of light and medium-mass nuclei, including neon and calcium isotopes. We quantify the circuit depth, width and number of gates to encode realistic shell-model wavefunctions. Our strategy also addresses explicitly energy measurements and the required number of circuits to perform them. Our simulated circuits approach the benchmark results exponentially with a polynomial scaling in quantum resources for each nucleus. This work paves the way for quantum computing shell-model studies across the nuclear chart and our quantum resource quantification may be used in configuration-interaction calculations of other fermionic systems. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation of the Spanish Government; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (951911); Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Manchester, FSE, (CEX2019-000918-M, MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033); European Commission, EC, (PID2020-118758GB-I00, RYC-2017-22781, RYC2018-026072)","A.M.R. thanks J.

We provide simple fault-tolerant procedures that exploit such redundancy by combining a phase flip error correction code with the Gauss’ law constraint to correct one-qubit errors for a Z2 or truncated U(1) LGT in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions with a link flux cutoff of 1. Unlike existing work on detecting violations of Gauss’ law, our circuits are fault tolerant and the overall error correction scheme outperforms a naïve application of the [5, 1, 3] code. The constructions outlined can be extended to LGT systems with larger cutoffs and may be of use in understanding how to hybridize error correction and quantum simulation for LGTs in higher space-time dimensions and with different symmetry groups. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Codes (symbols); Fault tolerance; Gages; Lattice theory; Quantum chemistry; Error correction codes; Fault-tolerant procedures; Gauge symmetries; Gauss' Law; Lattice gauge theory; Local hamiltonians; Phase-flip error; Quantum error corrections; Quantum simulations; Simple++; Error correction","Co-Design Center for Quantum Advantage, (DE-SC0012704); Environment Executive Agency; IQuS; National Quantum Information Science Research Centers; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-SC0020970); Office of Science, SC; Google; HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme, (101080086—NeQST); European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency, CINEA; European Commission, EC","Funding text 1: We thank Jesse Stryker and Martin Savage for useful discussions in the early stages of this work.

Here, we successfully synthesized the hcp-(La,Ce)H9-10 at 113 GPa with the initial La/Ce ratio close to 3:1. The high-temperature superconductivity was strikingly observed at 176 K and 100 GPa with the extrapolated upper critical field H c2(0) reaching 235 T. We also studied the binary La-H system for comparison, which exhibited a T c of 103 K at 78 GPa. The T c and H c2(0) of the La-Ce-H are respectively enhanced by over 80 K and 100 T with respect to the binary La-H and Ce-H components. The experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that the formation of the solid solution contributes not only to enhanced stability but also to superior superconducting properties. These results show how better superconductors can be engineered in the new hydrides by large addition of alloy-forming elements. © 2023, The Author(s).","","alloy; cerium; lanthanum; tungsten; chemical compound; high temperature; pressure; solid solution; superconductivity; anisotropy; Article; crystal structure; electric resistance; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; hypobaric pressure; magnetron sputtering; scanning electron microscopy; superconductivity; synthesis; temperature dependence; X ray diffraction","Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Development Project, (20210509038RQ); Zhejiang Provincial Science and technology innovation Team, (2021R01004); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11974133, 52072188); Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (19-72-30043); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFA1405500); Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University, (IRT_15R23)","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2022YFA1405500), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 52072188, and No. 11974133), the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (Grant No. IRT_15R23), Zhejiang Provincial Science and technology innovation Team (2021R01004), and Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Development Project (20210509038RQ).

However, their application to the fast generation of multi-partite quantum gates is still not optimized. Here we propose the reverse-engineering approach to design the longitudinal coupling between a set of qubits coupled to several field modes, for achieving a fast generation of multi-partite quantum gates in photonic or qubit-based architecture. We show that the enhancing generation time is at the nanosecond scale that does not scale with the number of system components. In addition, our protocol does not suffer noticeable detrimental effects due to the dissipative dynamics.

Here, the environment is dynamically downfolded on the correlated subspace. It is captured via renormalization of one and two quasiparticle interaction terms which are evaluated using many-body perturbation theory. We outline the strategy on how to take the dynamical effects into account by going beyond the static limit approximation. Further, we introduce an efficient stochastic implementation that enables treating the host environment with a large number of electrons at a minimal computational cost. For a small explicitly correlated subspace, the dynamical effects are critical. We demonstrate the methodology by reproducing optical excitations in the negatively charged NV center defect in diamond, that agree with experimental results. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Computation theory; Perturbation techniques; Quantum theory; Dynamical effects; Host mediums; Interaction term; Localised; Many body perturbation theory; Quantum state; Renormalization; Static limits; Stochastic implementation; Two-quasiparticle; Stochastic systems","Center for Scientific Computing; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS-1725797, DMR-1720256); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC, (BES-ERCAP0020089, DE-AC02-05CH11231, TG-CHE180051); Advanced Scientific Computing Research, ASCR, (DE-SC0022198); University of California, Santa Barbara, UCSB, (2139319); Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Harvard University, MRSEC; California NanoSystems Institute, CNSI","Funding text 1: The calculations were also performed as part of the XSEDE computational Project No. TG-CHE180051.

In strong field physics, tunnel ionization plays an important role, and accurate knowledge of the time-dependent tunnel rate is of paramount importance. The Keldysh theory and other more advanced related theories are often used, but their accuracy is still controversial. In previous work, we suggested using a curved waveguide as a quantum simulator to simulate the tunnel ionization process.

The quantum diode is characterized by the presence of nonreciprocity in transport, which describes the one-way transfer between excitations at both boundary resonators of the lattice. We find that the quality of the quantum diode defined by fidelity can be improved by increasing the modulation amplitude, i.e., the one-way excitation transfer process becomes more and more pronounced with the increase of the modulation amplitude. By further modifying the cyclical modulation and optimizing the control function, we also realize a much faster one-way excitation transfer to accelerate the nonreciprocal transport in the quantum diode, where almost a threefold reduction in time spent can be achieved. Our work provides a distinct idea and insight for the application of the quantum transport in topological systems. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Diodes; Electrodynamics; Time varying networks; Timing circuits; Adiabatic pumping; Excitation transfer; Modulation amplitudes; Nonreciprocity; One-dimensional; Quantum electrodynamics; Su Schrieffer Heeger model; Superconducting circuit; Time varying; Transfer process; Quantum chemistry","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12074094, 12074330, 62201493)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants No. 12074330, No. 62201493, and No. 12074094.

It has reached state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as chaotic time series prediction and continuous speech recognition thanks to its unique combination of high computational power and low training cost which sets it aside from alternatives such as traditionally trained recurrent neural networks, and furthermore is amenable to implementations in dedicated hardware, potentially leading to extremely compact and efficient reservoir computers. Recently the use of random quantum systems has been proposed, leveraging the complexity of quantum dynamics for classical time series processing. Extracting the output from a quantum system without disturbing its state too much is problematic however, and can be expected to become a bottleneck in such approaches. Here we propose a reservoir computing inspired approach to online processing of time series consisting of quantum information, sidestepping the measurement problem. We illustrate its power by generalizing two paradigmatic benchmark tasks from classical reservoir computing to quantum information and introducing a task without a classical analogue where a random system is trained to both create and distribute entanglement between systems that never directly interact. Finally, we discuss partial generalizations where only the input or only the output time series is quantum. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","CAIB, (PRD2018/47); Turku Collegium for Science, Medicine and Technology; Academy of Finland, AKA, (348854); Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI, (-C22/ AEI / 10.13039/501100011033, MDM-2017-0711, PID2019-109094GB-C21)","The author acknowledges the Spanish State Research Agency, through the Severo Ochoa and María de Maeztu Program for Centers and Units of Excellence in R &D (MDM-2017-0711) and through the QUARESC project (PID2019-109094GB-C21 and -C22/ AEI / 10.13039/501100011033).

In the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing era, the quantum resource is too scarce to support these explorations. Therefore, it is valuable to emulate quantum computing on classical computers for developing quantum algorithms and validating quantum hardware. However, existing simulators mostly suffer from the memory bottleneck so developing the approaches for large-scale quantum chemistry calculations remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a high-performance and massively parallel variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulator based on matrix product states, combined with embedding theory for solving large-scale quantum computing emulation for quantum chemistry on HPC platforms. We apply this method to study the torsional barrier of ethane and the quantification of the protein–ligand interactions.

The carrier transport properties of Coved GNRs with the periodic coved shape are designed to break the localized electronic state and reducing electron–phonon scattering. In this way, the mobility of Coved GNRs can be enhanced by orders compared with the zigzag GNRs in same width. Moreover, in contrast to occasional zero bandgap transition of armchair and zigzag GNRs without precision control in atomic level, the Coved GNRs with periodic edge structures can exclude the zero bandgap conditions, which makes practical the mass production process.

Wien, Vienna, 1090, Austria","“Generalized Hydrodynamics” (GHD) stands for a model that describes one-dimensional integrable systems in quantum physics, such as ultra-cold atoms or spin chains. Mathematically, GHD corresponds to nonlinear equations of kinetic type, where the main unknown, a statistical distribution function f(t,z,θ), lives in a phase space which is constituted by a one-dimensional position variable z, and a one-dimensional “kinetic” variable θ, actually a wave-vector, called “rapidity”. Two key features of GHD equations are first a non-local and nonlinear coupling in the advection term, and second an infinite set of conserved quantities, which prevent the system from thermalizing. To go beyond this, we consider the dissipative GHD equations, which are obtained by supplementing the right-hand side of the GHD equations with a non-local and nonlinear diffusion operator or a Boltzmann-type collision integral. In this paper, we deal with new high-order numerical methods to efficiently solve these kinetic equations. In particular, we devise novel backward semi-Lagrangian methods for solving the advective part (the so-called Vlasov equation) by using a high-order time-Taylor series expansion for the advection fields, whose successive time derivatives are obtained by a recursive procedure. This high-order temporal approximation of the advection fields is used to design new implicit/explicit Runge–Kutta semi-Lagrangian methods, which are compared to Adams–Moulton semi-Lagrangian schemes. For solving the source terms, constituted by the diffusion and collision operators, we use and compare different numerical methods of the literature. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Backward semi Lagrangian methods; Generalized HydroDynamics; High order Runge Kutta methods; Kinetic equations; Numerics of partial differential equations; Quantum Newtons Cradle","Advection; Distribution functions; Equations of motion; Hydrodynamics; Integral equations; Kinetic energy; Kinetic theory; Kinetics; Lagrange multipliers; Nonlinear equations; Numerical methods; Phase space methods; Vector spaces; Vlasov equation; Backward semi lagrangian method; Generalized hydrodynamic; High order runge kuttum method; High-order; Higher-order; Hydrodynamics equation; Kinetic equations; Numeric of partial differential equation; Quantum newton cradle; Semi-Lagrangian methods; Runge Kutta methods","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Vienna Science and Technology Fund, WWTF, (MA16-066); Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, ÖAW; Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (SFB F65)","We acknowledge support from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) via the grants SFB F65 “Taming Complexity in PDE systems” and, together with the German Research Foundation (DFG), via the Research Unit FOR 2724 “Thermal machines in the thermal world.” The work was further supported by the FQXI program on “Informations as fuel” and the ESQ Discovery Grant “Emergence of physical laws: from mathematical foundations to applications in many body physics” of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW), and by the Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF) project MA16-066 “SEQUEX”.

Solving the inverse problem to obtain an appropriate Hamiltonian directly from the desired properties has the potential to reach qualitatively new principles, but most research to date has been limited to quantitative determination of parameters within known models. Here, we develop a general framework that can automatically design a Hamiltonian with desired physical properties by using automatic differentiation. In the application to the quantum anomalous Hall effect, our framework can not only construct the Haldane model automatically but also generate Hamiltonians that exhibit a six-times larger anomalous Hall effect. In addition, the application to the photovoltaic effect gives an optimal Hamiltonian for electrons moving on a noncoplanar spin texture, which can generate ~ 700 Am−2 under solar radiation. This framework would accelerate materials exploration by automatic construction of models and principles. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Inverse problems; Photovoltaic effects; Textures; Anomalous hall effects; Automatic construction; Automatic differentiations; Determination of parameters; Haldane model; Material science; Non-coplanar; Property; Quantitative determinations; Spin textures; Hamiltonians","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN; Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, CREST, (JPMJCR18T2)","The authors thank Y.

Phases of a quantum system are determined by the so-called eigen microstates and their corresponding eigenvalues, which satisfy scaling relations in the critical regime. The quantum Rabi model (QRM) is taken as an example to demonstrate the validity of the EMA. Using both analytical and numerical calculations, we obtain the critical point, critical exponents, and scaling functions of the superradiant phase transition in the QRM. It suggests that a new phase emergency can be interpreted as a condensation of a specific eigen microstate. We expect that, in further studies, the EMA will be applied to more complex quantum phase transition problems in which order parameters cannot be easily defined. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Eigen microstate approach; Quantum phase transition; Quantum Rabi model","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Quantum optics; Analytical calculation; Critical regimes; Eigen microstate approach; Eigen-value; Microstates; Order parameter; Quantum rabi model; Quantum system; Quantum-phase transition; Scaling relations; Condensation","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12135003)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 12135003 ).

We determine the physical properties and conditions for creating scalable long distance entanglement and analyze its stability under the effect of the Coulomb interaction and the hopping amplitude. Furthermore, we show that the choice of the measurement basis in the protocol can drastically affect the fidelity of quantum teleportation and we argue that perfect information transfer can be attained by choosing an adequate basis reflecting the salient properties of the quantum channel, i.e. Hubbard projective measurements. © 2023, The Author(s).","","article","National Center for Scientific and Technical Research; Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (2020/38/E/ST3/00269); Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique et Technique, CNRST, (1UM5R2018)","S.A. acknowledges gratefully the National Center for Scientific and Technical Research (CNRST) for financial support (Grant No. 1UM5R2018).

Instead of restricting them to a two-level subspace, these high-dimensional (qudit) quantum systems are emerging as a powerful resource for the next generation of quantum processors. Yet harnessing the potential of these systems requires efficient ways of generating the desired interaction between them. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an implementation of a native two-qudit entangling gate up to dimension 5 in a trapped-ion system. This is achieved by generalizing a recently proposed light-shift gate mechanism to generate genuine qudit entanglement in a single application of the gate. The gate seamlessly adapts to the local dimension of the system with a calibration overhead that is independent of the dimension. © 2023, The Author(s).","","calibration; information; quantum mechanics; adiabaticity; Article; calibration; oscillation; polarization; quantum theory","EU Quantum Technology Flagship, (820495); IQI GmbH; Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-21-1-0007); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (840450); Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ODNI; Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, IARPA, (W911NF-16-1-0070); European Commission, EC; European Research Council, ERC, (101039522, 101043705); Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (F7109, Y879-N27); Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG, (872766)","This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 840450.

Taming spin relaxation and decoherence due to vibrations is crucial to reach this milestone, but this is hindered by our lack of understanding on the nature of vibrations and their coupling to spins. Here we propose a synergistic approach to study a prototypical molecular qubit. It combines inelastic X-ray scattering to measure phonon dispersions along the main symmetry directions of the crystal and spin dynamics simulations based on DFT. We show that the canonical Debye picture of lattice dynamics breaks down and that intra-molecular vibrations with very-low energies of 1-2 meV are largely responsible for spin relaxation up to ambient temperature. We identify the origin of these modes, thus providing a rationale for improving spin coherence. The power and flexibility of our approach open new avenues for the investigation of magnetic molecules with the potential of removing roadblocks toward their use in quantum devices. © 2023, The Author(s).","","crystal structure; lattice dynamics; light scattering; X-ray analysis; article; crystal; environmental temperature; leisure; phonon; radiation scattering; simulation; vibration","Trinity College Research IT; Fondazione Cariparma; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (862893); European Commission, EC, (CUP B83C22002830001, HC-4312); European Research Council, ERC, (948493); Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (B96C1700020008); Irish Centre for High-End Computing, ICHEC","Funding text 1: Dr. Yong Cai is gratefully acknowledged for useful discussions on IXS experiments.

Na3Bi is predicted to be Dirac semimetal with a Dirac node near the Fermi level. Hence, to validate the presence of Dirac cone and to check the stability of Na3Bi in cubic and hexagonal phases for its practical applications an ab-initio calculation has been performed. A structural phase transition has been observed from hexagonal to cubic phase at 0.89 GPa pressure for Na3Bi. The computed elastic constants satisfy Born-Huang stability criteria for both phases indicating the mechanical stability of the present compound. But it has been found that the P63/mmc phase of Na3Bi is dynamically unstable at ambient conditions therefore, the thermoelectric properties of c-Na3Bi have been investigated by employing Boltzmann transport theory. The low lattice thermal conductivity (1.89 W/mK) and high value of the figure of merit (0.32) at 1200K suggest a good thermoelectric response of the material at high temperatures. Hence, Na3Bi is a potential material that can be used in quantum electronic and thermoelectric devices. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","DFT; Mechanical properties; Na<sub>3</sub>Bi; Thermoelectric properties; Topological semimetals","Bismuth alloys; Mechanical stability; Statistical mechanics; Thermal conductivity; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; Topology; Condensed matter; Cubic phase; DFT; Dirac cones; Hexagonal phasis; Research fields; Thermoelectric properties; Topological insulators; Topological materials; Topological semimetal; Binary alloys","","","M.

In addition to such scientific interest, superionics are technologically relevant for energy, electronics, and sensing applications. Characterizing and understanding their elastic properties is, e.g., urgently needed to address their feasibility as solid-state electrolytes in all-solid-state batteries. However, static approaches to elasticity assume well-defined reference positions around which atoms vibrate, in contrast with the quasi-liquid motion of the mobile ions in fast ionic conductors. Here, we derive the elastic tensors of superionics from ensemble fluctuations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble, exploiting extensive Car-Parrinello simulations. We apply this approach to paradigmatic Li-ion conductors, and complement with a block analysis to compute statistical errors. Static approaches sampled over the trajectories often overestimate the response, highlighting the importance of a dynamical treatment in determining elastic tensors in superionics. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Ions; Solid electrolytes; Solid state devices; Solid-State Batteries; Tensors; Elastic tensors; Electronics applications; Energy applications; Fast ions; Ions diffusion; Normal condition; Sensing applications; Static approach; Superionic; Superionic material; Shear stress","Leonid Kahle; National Centre of Competence in Research MARVEL, (182892); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; Centro Svizzero di Calcolo Scientifico, CSCS, (mr28, s1073, s836)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and its National Centre of Competence in Research MARVEL on “Computational Design and Discovery of Novel Materials” (grant number 182892, G.M., N.M.).

It was found that NMD-TiO2 samples demonstrated an expanded ability for light absorption, resulting in an improved photoefficiency for CO2 reduction and selectivity towards carbon monoxide (CO). The conversion yields of CO2 to CO followed the order: Rh >Ru >Pt and with Rh/TiO2 reached 10.65 μmol/gcat (under visible light) and 7.84 μmol/gcat (under UV), which are ∼3 and 10 times more as compared to pristine anatase TiO2 (0, and 2.43 μmol/gcat). Various factors were addressed including theoretical studies via DFT revealed that the formation of new impurity energy state levels in NMD/TiO2, which act as acceptor levels.

Consequently, effective and sustainable methods of SO2 monitoring remain vital issues for detector development. However, despite decades of progress, current solutions based on resistive sensors remain limited by poor sensing performance of semiconducting materials when operated at room temperature and thus suffer from high power consumption due to heating. One solution could be to employ novel 2D semiconductor nanomaterials like MoS2, which have shown good room-temperature performance for gases such as NO2 and NH3. However, they have also shown limited response to other gases, which, on the other hand, can be improved by substitutional doping. Consequently, this work investigates, employing density functional theory, the doping of MoS2 with Si, P, Cl, Ge, and Se to improve its SO2 sensing capability. The results show that P, Cl, and P+Cl doping facilitates all desired effects with molecule-sheet charge transfers enhanced by over 300%, and moderate binding energies that enable effective surface diffusion of SO2 at 300 K. © 2023 The Author(s)","Doping; Gas sensing; MoS<sub>2</sub>; SO<sub>2</sub>; Transition metal dichalcogenides","Ammonia; Binding energy; Charge transfer; Density functional theory; Fossil fuels; Germanium compounds; Layered semiconductors; Semiconductor doping; Transition metals; 'current; Air pollutants; Detector development; Dichalcogenides; Doping strategies; Gas sensing; Human health; Resistive sensor; Sensing performance; Transition metal dichalcogenides; Molybdenum compounds","Ministry of Education and Science, MES, (0511/SBAD/2351, 0512/ SBAD/2320); Uniwersytet Warszawski, UW, (GB81-3)","The presented work has been financed by the Ministry of Education and Science in Poland in 2023 year under projects No. 0512/ SBAD/2320 and 0511/SBAD/2351 .

Various IM implementations have been proposed based on quantum, optical, digital and analog CMOS, as well as emerging technologies. Networks of coupled electronic oscillators have recently been shown to exhibit characteristics required for implementing IMs. However, for this approach to successfully solve complex optimization problems, a highly reconfigurable implementation is needed. In this work, the possibility of implementing highly reconfigurable oscillator-based IMs is explored. An implementation based on quasiperiodically modulated coupling strength through a common medium is proposed and its potential is demonstrated through numerical simulations. Moreover, a proof-of-concept implementation based on CMOS coupled ring oscillators is proposed and its functionality is demonstrated. Simulation results show that our proposed architecture can consistently find the Max-Cut solution and demonstrate the potential to greatly simplify the physical implementation of highly reconfigurable oscillator-based IMs. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2016-05980, 2022-02990)","This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council (VR) under 2016-05980 and 2022-02990 projects.

Although substantial efforts have been devoted to design Fe–N–Cs with increased active species content, surface area, and electronic conductivity, their performance is still far from satisfactory. Hitherto, there is limited research about regulation on the electronic spin states of Fe centers for Fe–N–Cs electrocatalysts to improve their catalytic performance. Here, we introduce Ti3C2 MXene with sulfur terminals to regulate the electronic configuration of FeN4 species and dramatically enhance catalytic activity toward ORR. The MXene with sulfur terminals induce the spin-state transition of FeN4 species and Fe 3d electron delocalization with d band center upshift, enabling the Fe(II) ions to bind oxygen in the end-on adsorption mode favorable to initiate the reduction of oxygen and boosting oxygen-containing groups adsorption on FeN4 species and ORR kinetics. The resulting FeN4–Ti3C2Sx exhibits comparable catalytic performance to those of commercial Pt-C. The developed wearable ZABs using FeN4–Ti3C2Sx also exhibit fast kinetics and excellent stability. This study confirms that regulation of the electronic structure of active species via coupling with their support can be a major contributor to enhance their catalytic activity.

One leading solution is Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). Simulating LQG may be important for providing predictions which can then be tested experimentally. However, such complex quantum simulations cannot run efficiently on classical computers, and quantum computers or simulators are needed. Here, we experimentally demonstrate quantum simulations of spinfoam amplitudes of LQG on an integrated photonics quantum processor. We simulate a basic transition of LQG and show that the derived spinfoam vertex amplitude falls within 4% error with respect to the theoretical prediction, despite experimental imperfections. We also discuss how to generalize the simulation for more complex transitions, in realistic experimental conditions, which will eventually lead to a quantum advantage demonstration as well as expand the toolbox to investigate LQG. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Gravitation; Photonics; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Relativity; Experimental simulations; General Relativity; Integrated photonics; Loop quantum gravity; Modern physics; Photonic chips; Quanta computers; Quantum processors; Quantum simulations; Quantum simulators; Quantum computers","National Science Foundation, NSF, (PHY-1912278, PHY-2207763); Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, AvH; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (15872, 680.91.037, CCF-1838435)","M.H. receives support from the National Science Foundation through grants PHY-1912278 and PHY-2207763.

The reuse of active materials in Li-ion batteries is critical for this goal. Herein, we investigated the electrochemical performance of Li3VO4 (LVO) anode with pectin as a binder. Our Li-ion half-cells showed stable capacity of 230 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.02 A g−1 after 100 cycles. In addition, we observed a novel enhanced specific capacity of 400 mAh g−1 during delithiation at a high current density of 1 A g−1, which did not occur during lithiation. This higher capacity was can be attributed to the pseudocapacitive lithium storage behavior in the LVO-pectin electrode, as identified by CV and EIS analyses. The heterostructure of LVO-pectin resulted in an interfacial surface charge that contributed to the capacity, as demonstrated by impedance spectroscopy in conjunction with the distribution of relaxation times. The utilization of pectin as an eco-friendly binder demonstrated nearly 90 % material recovery and 100 % capability for subsequent re-lithiation, indicating recyclability. Furthermore, the pseudocapacitive effect becomes increasingly dominant in regenerated LVO-pectin cells. These results exemplify a promising approach towards the development of environmentally friendly Li-ion batteries with high energy and power density. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Li<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>; Lithium-ion batteries; Pectin binder; Polymer; Regeneration","Anodes; Ions; Lithium compounds; Recycling; Active material; Battery systems; Lithiation; Pectin binder; Pseudocapacitive; Recyclables; Recycling process; Regeneration; Reuse; System design and development; Lithium-ion batteries","Executive Yuan, (AS-FLI-110-LI); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (110-2811-E-027-504)","The authors greatly appreciate the financial supports from the Executive Yuan through its Forward-Looking Research Grant Number AS-FLI-110-LI .

Recent investigations have shown that hyperbolic lattices in non-Euclidean space can also be characterized by hyperbolic Bloch theorem. This theory promotes the investigation of hyperbolic band topology, where hyperbolic topological band insulators protected by first Chern numbers have been proposed. Here, we report a new finding on the construction of hyperbolic topological band insulators with a vanished first Chern number but a non-trivial second Chern number. Our model possesses the non-abelian translational symmetry of {8,8} hyperbolic tiling. By engineering intercell couplings and onsite potentials of sublattices in each unit cell, the non-trivial bandgaps with quantized second Chern numbers can appear. In experiments, we fabricate two types of finite hyperbolic circuit networks with periodic boundary conditions and partially open boundary conditions to detect hyperbolic topological band insulators. Our work suggests a new way to engineer hyperbolic topological states with higher-order topological invariants. © 2023, The Author(s).","","boundary condition; insulation; symmetry; topology; article","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12104041); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFA1404900)","This work is supported by the National Key R & D Program of China under Grant No. 2022YFA1404900 and National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China No. 12104041.

In this work, we have synthesized λ-MnO2 nanoplates through one step co-precipitation method and used for flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (SC). The structural, morphological and electrochemical properties of synthesized λ-MnO2 were systematically investigated. The optical and electronic properties of λ-MnO2 were studied using UV–vis spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The pseudocapacitive λ-MnO2 nanoplates-like electrode showed a maximum specific capacitance of 288.5 F g−1 at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1. To check the practicability, symmetric (λ-MnO2//λ-MnO2) as well as asymmetric (λ-MnO2//AC and λ-MnO2//Ti3C2Tx MXene) SCs were fabricated and their performances were compared. The asymmetric λ-MnO2//Ti3C2Tx MXene SC demonstrated a maximum energy density of 15.5 Wh kg−1 at the power density 1100 W kg−1 along with 86.3 % of capacitive retention after 5000 cycles. Besides, to confirm the suitability of these electrodes for flexible energy storage, a flexible λ-MnO2//Ti3C2Tx asymmetric SC was fabricated using PVA: Na2SO4 gel polymer electrolyte that operated in the potential window of 2 V and supplies high areal energy density of 39.9 μWh cm−2 at a power density of 8586 μW cm−2. Therefore, the λ-MnO2 prepared with a simple and scalable co-precipitation method may play a promising role in flexible energy storage. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Flexible hybrid supercapacitor; Nanoplate; Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXene; λ-MnO<sub>2</sub>","Coprecipitation; Density functional theory; Electrodes; Electronic properties; Energy storage; Nanostructures; Sodium sulfate; Supercapacitor; Titanium compounds; Asymmetric supercapacitor; Coprecipitation method; Energy density; Flexible hybrid supercapacitor; Hybrid supercapacitors; Nanoplates; Pseudocapacitive; Synthesised; Ti3C2Tx mxene; Λ-MnO2; Manganese oxide","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी, (DST/INSPIRE/04/2017/002737); Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences, BRNS, (2022–2025, 58/14/06/2022-BRNS/37040, SR/FST/PS-1/2020/135)","ADJ is grateful to the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Govt. of India for financial assistance under the DST INSPIRE Faculty scheme [ DST/INSPIRE/04/2017/002737 ], DAE-BRNS Mumbai for financial support through Project No. 58/14/06/2022-BRNS/37040 for the 2022–2025 and Fund for Improvement of S&T Infrastructure (FIST) [ SR/FST/PS-1/2020/135 ] scheme.

These structures are dynamically stable as their phonon dispersions showed no soft phonon frequencies. The investigation of the optical properties revealed that monolayers Penta-PtXY have in-plane anisotropic optical properties with higher absorption spectra along the y-direction. Moreover, the maximum absorption occurs in the ultraviolet (UV) region, therefore, they can harvest UV and visible photons more effectively.

However, this requires handling noise arising from unwanted interactions in these systems. Several protocols have been proposed to address efficient and accurate quantum noise profiling and mitigation. In this work, we propose a novel protocol that efficiently estimates the average output of a noisy quantum device to be used for quantum noise mitigation. The multi-qubit system average behavior is approximated as a special form of a Pauli Channel where Clifford gates are used to estimate the average output for circuits of different depths. The characterized Pauli channel error rates, and state preparation and measurement errors are then used to construct the outputs for different depths thereby eliminating the need for large simulations and enabling efficient mitigation. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed protocol on four IBM Q 5-qubit quantum devices. Our method demonstrates improved accuracy with efficient noise characterization. We report up to 88% and 69% improvement for the proposed approach compared to the unmitigated, and pure measurement error mitigation approaches, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","","","M.E.

The superconductor UTe2 is a rare material wherein electrons are believed to form pairs in a unique spin-triplet state with potential topological properties. While spin-triplet pairing may be mediated by ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic fluctuations, experimentally, the magnetic properties of UTe2 are unclear. By way of muon spin rotation/relaxation (μSR) measurements on independently grown UTe2 single crystals we demonstrate the existence of magnetic clusters that gradually freeze into a disordered spin frozen state at low temperatures. Our findings suggest that inhomogeneous freezing of magnetic clusters is linked to the ubiquitous residual linear term in the temperature dependence of the specific heat (C) and the low-temperature upturn in C/T versus T. The omnipresent magnetic inhomogeneity has potential implications for experiments aimed at establishing the intrinsic low-temperature properties of UTe2. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Freezing; Single crystals; Specific heat; Spin fluctuations; Superconducting materials; Tellurium compounds; Temperature distribution; Cooper pair; Long range interactions; Longer-range interaction; Magnetic cluster; Spin freezing; Spin-singlet state; Spin-triplet state; Spins fluctuations; Superconducting state; Topological properties; Topology","Maryland Quantum Materials Center; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-SC-0019154); National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, (70NANB17H301); Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, GBMF, (GBMF9071); Basic Energy Sciences, BES; Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD; Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering, DMSE; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/ N023803/1)","Funding text 1: J.E.S. and S.R.D. acknowledge support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

However, for many of them the molecular determinants of the gating mechanism remain elusive. Here, using a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, we address this problem focusing on the cardiac hERG potassium channel. Network analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories reveals the presence of a kinematic chain of residues that couples the voltage sensor domain to the pore domain and involves the S4/S1 and S1/S5 subunit interfaces. Mutagenesis experiments confirm the role of these residues and interfaces in the activation and inactivation mechanisms.

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), an all-carbon one-dimensional material whose spin-free environment and weak spin-orbit coupling promise long spin coherence times, offer a diverse degree of freedom for extended range of functionality not available to bulk systems. A key requirement limiting spin qubit implementation in SWCNTs is disciplined confinement of isolated spins. Here, we report the creation of highly confined electron spins in SWCNTs via a bottom-up approach. The record long coherence time of 8.2 µs and spin-lattice relaxation time of 13 ms of these electronic spin qubits allow demonstration of quantum control operation manifested as Rabi oscillation. Investigation of the decoherence mechanism reveals an intrinsic coherence time of tens of milliseconds.

Then the CoFe2O4/MoS2 composite coated on Ni foam was studied as a supercapacitor electrode. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) shows the successful exfoliation of bulk MoS2 powder into few-layer MoS2 nanosheets. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirm the crystal structure formation of CoFe2O4/MoS2 nanostructures and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrate their morphologies. The electrochemical energy storage tests were conducted using a three-electrode setup. We found that MoS2 nanosheets considerably enhance the pseudocapacitance properties of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, especially its specific capacitance from 500 to 1013 F/g, its power density from 125.0 to 166.6 W/kg, and its energy density from 11.1 to 22.5 Wh/kg. More importantly, we found that the incorporation of MoS2 nanosheets enhances the charge-discharge cycling stability of CoFe2O4. We also constructed a two-electrode (asymmetric) setup using the CoFe2O4/MoS2 composite coated on Ni foam as one electrode and activated carbon as the other electrode, and showed it can light up a red LED for several minutes. We also conducted some calculations in the framework of density functional theory to study how the interface of MoS2 and CoFe2O4 would help them toward better charge storage. We found that the built-in electric field developed across the interface can pull electrons from CoFe2O4 toward MoS2 for better charge redistribution, and the incorporation of MoS2 would add some energy states near the Fermi level that can increase the capacitance of CoFe2O4. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Cobalt ferrite; MoS2; Nanocomposite; Pseudocapacitor; Supercapacitor; Two-dimensional materials","Activated carbon; Capacitance; Cobalt; Crystal structure; Density functional theory; Electric discharges; Electrochemical electrodes; Foams; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Interface states; Iron compounds; Layered semiconductors; Nanoparticles; Nanosheets; Sulfur compounds; Supercapacitor; Atomic-force-microscopy; Cobalt ferrites; Crystals structures; Enhanced pseudocapacitance; Ni foam; Pseudocapacitors; Situ hydrothermal methods; Supercapacitor electrodes; Two-dimensional materials; X ray diffraction patterns; Molybdenum compounds","","","K.

While the neutral atom processors are the pioneering platform in terms of scalability, the dipolar Rydberg gates impose the main bottlenecks on the scaling of these devices. This article presents an alternative scheme for neutral atom quantum processing, based on the Fermi scattering of a Rydberg electron from ground-state atoms in spin-dependent lattice geometries. Instead of relying on Rydberg pair-potentials, the interaction is controlled by engineering the electron cloud of a sole Rydberg atom. The present scheme addresses the scaling obstacles in Rydberg processors by exponentially suppressing the population of short-lived states and by operating in ultra-dense atomic lattices. The restoring forces in molecule type Rydberg-Fermi potential preserve the trapping over a long interaction period. Furthermore, the proposed scheme mitigates different competing infidelity criteria, eliminates unwanted cross-talks, and significantly suppresses the operation depth in running complicated quantum algorithms. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Atoms; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Rydberg states; Classical counterpart; Exponentials; Ground-state atoms; Neutral atoms; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; Rydberg; Rydberg electron; Scalings; Speed up; Ground state","Hauser-Raspe foundation; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (HR001120C0068); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (817482); Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (F7108-N38, Y1067-N27)","This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through a START grant under Project no.

Herein, we present experimental demonstrations and theoretical studies on the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of MnSi and Mn4Si7 nanowires grown by thermal chemical vapor deposition. The crystallinity of the nanowires was confirmed by a high-resolution transmission electron microscope and elemental distribution. The ratio of Mn to Si (∼0.96–1.04) indicates uniformity in MnSi composition. Additionally, the Mn4Si7 nanowire has an Mn/Si ratio of ∼0.78–0.87, which deviates from the homogenous Mn4Si7 ratio of ∼ 0.6 due to a higher Mn content at the nucleation sites. We found that the MnSi nanowires remained ferromagnetic (FM), similar to bulk MnSi, whereas the Mn4Si7 nanowires exhibited an FM order in contrast to the non-magnetic nature of bulk Mn4Si7. Field-cooled and zero-field-cooled magnetization curves reveal that the Mn4Si7 nanowires exhibited an FM order with a transition temperature (Tc) above room temperature. In contrast, the MnSi nanowires have a lower Tc of ∼ 30 K. It is noting that the First-principles density functional theory calculations demonstrated that both MnSi and Mn4Si7 nanowires possess a metallic characteristic. The spin-charge density of Mn4Si7 nanowires was found to be localized near the surface, implying a surface-induced magnetism. These findings suggest the possibility of tunning the phase evolution of Si-based nanowires by simply changing the diffusion mechanism of the Mn precursor. These metallic nanowires may be used as nanoscale interconnects and gate electrodes in nanoscale technologies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Mn<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>7</sub>; MnSi; Nanowires; One-dimensional nanomaterials, magnetic nanowire arrays","Crystallinity; Density functional theory; Frequency modulation; Magnetic properties; Manganese; Manganese compounds; Silicon compounds; Electronic and magnetic properties; Experimental demonstrations; Ferromagnetic orderings; Magnetic nanowire arrays; Nano scale; One-dimensional nanomaterial, magnetic nanowire array; One-dimensional nanomaterials; Phase evolutions; Theoretical study; Thermal chemical vapor deposition; Nanowires","Sussex Strategic Development Fund; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/STG02/UM/02/7); Universiti Malaya, UM, (ST066-2021)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia via the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2019/STG02/UM/02/7) and the University of Malaya SATU Joint Research Scheme 2019 (ST066-2021).

Calcium alanates have been intensively studied at ambient pressure for their hydrogen-storage properties, but their high-pressure behavior is largely unknown. By performing a full scan of the ternary convex hull at several pressures between 0 and 300 GPa, we identify several new structural motifs, characterized by a high Al-H coordination, where Al d orbitals participate in the bonding. Among all new phases thus identified, we focus in particular on a phase with CaAlH7 composition, which lies on the convex hull at 300 GPa, and remains dynamically stable down to 50 GPa, with a predicted superconducting T c of 82 K, which likely represents a new promising template to achieve increase chemical precompression in ternary hydrides. Our findings reveal important insights into the structure-property relationships of calcium alanates under high pressure, and highlight a possible strategy to achieve conventional superconductivity at low pressures. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd","condensed matter physics; electron-phonon coupling; electronic structure; superconductivity","Aluminum compounds; Calcium; Calcium compounds; Chemical bonds; Computational geometry; Crystal structure; Electron-phonon interactions; Hydrogen storage; Phase diagrams; Ab initio crystal structures; Calcium alanate; Condensed-matter physics; Convex hull; Crystal structure prediction; Electron phonon couplings; Electronic.structure; First-principle study; High pressure; Superconducting phase diagrams; Electronic structure","CINECA, (71754); National Recovery and Resilience Plan, (11.10.2022, 1561); European Commission, EC; Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (P30269-N36, PE0000021); Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca, MUR","L B and S D C acknowledge funding from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) P30269-N36 and support from Fondo Ateneo-Sapienza 2018-2021.

The CNTs are selected from three zigzag, armchair, and chiral groups. We examine the effect of carbon nanotube (CNT) chirality on the interaction between CNTs and glycoproteins. Results indicate that the chiral semiconductor CNTs clearly response to the presence of the glycoproteins by changing the electronic band gaps and electron density of states (DOS). Since the changes in the CNTs band gaps in the presence of N-linked are about two times larger than the changes in the presence of the O-linked glycoprotein, chiral CNT may distinguish different types of the glycoproteins. The same results are obtained from CNBs. Thereby, we predict CNBs and chiral CNTs have suitable potential in sequential analysis of N- and O-linked glycosylation of the spike protein. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Biosensing Techniques; COVID-19; Humans; Nanotubes, Carbon; SARS-CoV-2; Semiconductors; carbon nanotube; genetic procedures; human; semiconductor","","","F.

Nevertheless, noise in quantum devices prevents most quantum algorithms from achieving the quantum advantage. Quantum error mitigation provides a variety of protocols to handle such noise using minimal qubit resources. While some of those protocols have been implemented in experiments for a few qubits, it remains unclear whether error mitigation will be effective in quantum circuits with tens to hundreds of qubits. In this paper, we apply statistics principles to quantum error mitigation and analyse the scaling behaviour of its intrinsic error. We find that the error increases linearly O(ϵN) with the gate number N before mitigation and sublinearly O(ϵ′Nγ) after mitigation, where γ ≈ 0.5, ϵ is the error rate of a quantum gate, and ϵ′ is a protocol-dependent factor. The N scaling is a consequence of the law of large numbers, and it indicates that error mitigation can suppress the error by a larger factor in larger circuits. We propose the importance Clifford sampling as a key technique for error mitigation in large circuits to obtain this result. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Error statistics; Quantum optics; Qubits; Classical computing; Error mitigation; Error rate; Large circuits; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum device; Quantum error; Scaling behaviours; Importance sampling","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-SC0019318); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11875050, 12088101); National Safety Academic Fund, NSAF, (U1930403)","The authors thank Hang Ren for the discussions.

These transitions are governed by fundamental properties of the corresponding Bloch wave functions, including orbital and magnetic degrees of freedom, and quantum geometric properties such as the Berry curvature. In particular, orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is closely linked to the Berry curvature, can exhibit a nontrivial momentum dependence. We demonstrate how information on such OAM textures can be extracted from the circular dichroism in RIXS. Based on accurate modeling with a first-principles treatment of the key ingredient—the light–matter interaction—we simulate dichroic RIXS spectra for the prototypical transition-metal dichalcogenide MoSe2 and the two-dimensional topological insulator 1T′-MoS2. Guided by an intuitive picture of the optical selection rules, we discuss how the momentum-dependent OAM manifests itself in the dichroic RIXS signal if one controls the momentum transfer. Our calculations are performed for typical experimental geometries and parameter regimes, and demonstrate the possibility of observing the predicted circular dichroism in forthcoming experiments. Thus, our work establishes a new avenue for observing Berry curvature and topological states in quantum materials. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (193527, 200021-196966, 200021_207904, 205602); National Center of Competence in Research Materials’ Revolution: Computational Design and Discovery of Novel Materials, NCCR MARVEL; National Centre of Competence in Research Robotics","We thank Urs Staub and Krzysztof Wohlfeld for fruitful discussions and useful insights.

Since quantum effects arise at the nano-scale, these systems are difficult to simulate on classical computers. Quantum computers can efficiently simulate quantum many-body systems, yet current quantum algorithms for calculating thermal properties of these systems incur significant computational costs in that they either prepare the full thermal state on the quantum computer, or they must sample a number of pure states from a distribution that grows with system size. Canonical thermal pure quantum (TPQ) states provide a promising path to estimating thermal properties of quantum materials as they neither require preparation of the full thermal state nor require a growing number of samples with system size. Here, we present an algorithm for preparing canonical TPQ states on quantum computers. We compare three different circuit implementations for the algorithm and demonstrate their capabilities in estimating thermal properties of quantum materials. Due to its increasing accuracy with system size and flexibility in implementation, we anticipate that this method will enable finite temperature explorations of relevant quantum materials on near-term quantum computers. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC02-05CH11231); Office of Science, SC; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, LBNL","This research was supported by the Office of Science, Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research Accelerated Research for Quantum Computing Program of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.

Here we report high-field magneto-photoluminescence spectroscopy from three emission lines (Q1, Q2, and Q*) of He-ion induced sulfur vacancies in monolayer MoS2. Analysis of the asymmetric PL lineshapes in combination with the diamagnetic shift of Q1 and Q2 yields a consistent picture of localized emitters with a wave function extent of ~3.5 nm. The distinct valley-Zeeman splitting in out-of-plane B-fields and the brightening of dark states through in-plane B-fields necessitates spin-valley selectivity of the defect states and lifted spin-degeneracy at zero field. Comparing our results to ab initio calculations identifies the nature of Q1 and Q2 and suggests that Q* is the emission from a chemically functionalized defect. Analysis of the optical degree of circular polarization reveals that the Fermi level is a parameter that enables the tunability of the emitter.

Here we gather the evidence for this case in the most common task in quantum chemistry, namely, ground-state energy estimation, for generic chemical problems where heuristic quantum state preparation might be assumed to be efficient. The availability of exponential quantum advantage then centers on whether features of the physical problem that enable efficient heuristic quantum state preparation also enable efficient solution by classical heuristics. Through numerical studies of quantum state preparation and empirical complexity analysis (including the error scaling) of classical heuristics, in both ab initio and model Hamiltonian settings, we conclude that evidence for such an exponential advantage across chemical space has yet to be found. While quantum computers may still prove useful for ground-state quantum chemistry through polynomial speedups, it may be prudent to assume exponential speedups are not generically available for this problem. © 2023, The Author(s).","","iron; nitrogenase; sulfur; empirical analysis; heuristics; quantum mechanics; ab initio calculation; adiabaticity; algorithm; Article; electron; heuristics; phase transition; quantum chemistry","Google Quantum AI; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CHE-2102505, DE-NA0003525, DE-SC0017867, DE-SC0020290, OAC-1550456, OMA-2016245, PHY-1733907, PHY-1748958); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, KITP; Office of Science, SC, (DE-SC0019374, DE-SC0019390, DOE-SC0018140)","Funding text 1: Work by S.L., H.Z., and G.K.C. was funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, via Award DE-SC0019374.

Herein, we report a 2D-2D flake-on-sheet WS2@N-rGO epitaxial hybrid nanostructure (WNRHN), which significantly enhances energy storage capacity. In the developed epitaxial hybrid nanostructure, the C-O-W bond, that connects the flake and sheet, forms a highly integrated interface, facilitating interfacial charge transport and enhancing its mechanical strength to withstand volume variations. Such emergence of charge driven interfacial transport in the studied system is further supported by ab initio calculations. The epitaxial hybrid nanostructure exhibits remarkable specific capacitance (158.28 F g−1) and cyclability (118 % over 5000 cycles and 85 % over 9000 cycles), demonstrating its significant potential for energy storage. Moreover, the tailored WS2@N-rGO epitaxial hybrid nanostructure offers superior flexibility, making it ideal for use in flexible and portable devices. The as-fabricated symmetric supercapacitor has a remarkable cyclic stability (126 % up to 5000 cycles) with ultra-power (850.03 W/kg) and energy density (19.6 Wh/kg). The asymmetric supercapacitor can deliver maximum energy density (44.23 Wh/kg) and power density (1899.97 W/kg) with high capacitance (88.22 F g−1). The brilliance of this study will lay foundation for 2D-2D epitaxial hybrid nanostructure to fit into commercial application. © 2023","Asymmetric supercapacitors; Cyclic stability; DFT-study; Epitaxial hybrid nanostructure; Symmetric supercapacitors","Capacitance; Energy storage; Flexible electronics; Nanostructures; Tungsten compounds; Asymmetric supercapacitor; Cyclic stability; DFT study; Energy density; Epitaxial hybrid nanostructure; Hybrid nanostructures; Robust energy; Storage performance; Symmetric supercapacitor; Symmetrics; Supercapacitor","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी, (IF190778); Tezpur University, TU; CSIR-North East Institute of Science and Technology, CSIR-NEIST","Funding text 1: MS would like to acknowledge SAIC, Tezpur University for characterization analyses.

They are considered suitable for this as the circuits that are run can be tailored to the device, and a big part of the computation is delegated to the classical optimizer. It has also been hypothesized that they may be more robust to hardware noise than conventional algorithms due to their hybrid nature. However, the effect of training quantum machine learning models under the influence of hardware-induced noise has not yet been extensively studied. In this work, we address this question for a specific type of learning, namely variational reinforcement learning, by studying its performance in the presence of various noise sources: shot noise, coherent and incoherent errors. We analytically and empirically investigate how the presence of noise during training and evaluation of variational quantum reinforcement learning algorithms affect the performance of the agents and robustness of the learned policies. Furthermore, we provide a method to reduce the number of measurements required to train Q-learning agents, using the inherent structure of the algorithm. © 2023, The Author(s).","Quantum hardware noise; Quantum machine learning; Variational quantum algorithms","Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum theory; Reinforcement learning; Hardware error; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Performance; Quantum algorithms; Quantum hardware noise; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum reinforcement learning; Variational quantum algorithm; Shot noise","National Research Centre, NRC, (CN00000013); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (13N15587, BMB+F, QAI2-Q-KIS); Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschap, OCW, (024.003.037); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","AS is funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMB+F) in the project QAI2-Q-KIS under grant 13N15587.

The accelerating developments in the field have led to a highly advanced set of engineering techniques that, for example, can tune interactions, shape the external geometry, select among a large set of atomic species with different properties, or control the number of atoms. In particular, it is possible to operate in lower dimensions and drive atomic systems into the strongly correlated regime. In this review, we discuss recent advances in few-body cold atom systems confined in low dimensions from a theoretical viewpoint. We mainly focus on bosonic systems in one dimension and provide an introduction to the static properties before we review the state-of-the-art research into quantum dynamical processes stimulated by the presence of correlations. Besides discussing the fundamental physical phenomena arising in these systems, we also provide an overview of the calculational and numerical tools and methods that are commonly used, thus delivering a balanced and comprehensive overview of the field. We conclude by giving an outlook on possible future directions that are interesting to explore in these correlated systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Beyond mean-field approaches; Cold atoms; Droplets; Few-body physics; Long-range physics; Multicomponent bosonic settings; One-dimensional systems; Quantum control; Quantum dynamics; Spinor gases; Strongly correlated gases; Systems with impurities","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Harvard University; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (754411); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (390715994, EXC2056); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP23K03290); Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (JPMJPF2221); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (406563/2021-7); Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, OIST; Horizon 2020; Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond, DFF","Funding text 1: This review could not have been written without the many fruitful discussions and great collaborations with colleagues throughout the years, there are too many to mention.

Here, we report that most of the low-frequency and intermediate-frequency signals of SWNTs are radial-tangential modes (RTMs) coexisting radial and tangential Eigenvectors, while only the first peak at the low-frequency side is the RBM. Density functional theory simulation for SWNTs of ~ 2 nm in diameter shows that dozens of RTMs exhibit following the RBM (~ 150 cm−1) up to G-mode (~ 1592 cm−1) in order with Landau regulation. We specify the RBM and the RTM on Raman spectra obtained from SWNTs, where both appear as prominent peaks between 149 and 170 cm−1 and ripple-like peaks between 166 and 1440 cm−1, respectively. We report that the RTMs have been regarded as RBM (~ 300 cm−1) and ambiguously named as intermediate-frequency mode (300–1300 cm−1) without assignment. The RTMs gradually interlink the RBM and the G-mode resulting in the symmetric Raman spectra in intensity. We reveal high-resolution transmission microscope evidence for a helical structure of SWNTs, informing the typical diameter of commercial SWNTs to be 1.4–2 nm. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","Korea Institute of Science and Technology, KIST, (2E31011); Korea Basic Science Institute, KBSI, (D210400)","This work was supported by KIST Future Resource Program (2E31011) and Korea Basic Science Institute Institutional Programs (D210400).

For dimension d≥ 3 , a form of entanglement exists that is hard to detect and called bound entanglement due to the fact that such entangled states cannot be used for entanglement distillation. Up to this date, no efficient solution is known to differentiate bound entangled from separable states. We address and compare this problem named separability problem for a family of bipartite Bell diagonal qudits with special algebraic and geometric structures and applications in quantum information processing tasks in different dimensions. Extending analytical and numerical methods and results for Bell diagonal qutrits (d= 3), we successfully classify more than 75 % of representative Bell diagonal PPT states for d= 4. Via those representative states we are able to estimate the volumes of separable and bound entangled states among PPT ququarts (d= 4). We find that at least 75.7 % of all PPT states are separable, 1.7 % bound entangled and for 22.6 % it remains unclear whether they are separable or bound entangled. Comparing the structure of bound entangled states and their detectors, we find considerable differences in the detection capabilities for different dimensions and relate those to differences of the Euclidean geometry for qutrits (d= 3) and ququarts (d= 4). Finally, using a detailed visual analysis of the set of separable and bound entangled Bell diagonal states in both dimensions, qualitative observations are made that allow to better distinguish bound entangled from separable states. © 2023, The Author(s).","","article; geometry","Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (P36102-N)","B.C.H. and C.P. acknowledge gratefully that this research was funded in whole, or in part, by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) project P36102-N.

Using a phase-modulating spatial light modulator (SLM), we generate arbitrary light potentials holographically with measured efficiencies between 15 and 40% and an accuracy of < 2 % root-mean-squared error. Key to the high accuracy is the modelling of pixel crosstalk of the SLM on a sub-pixel scale which is relevant especially for large light potentials. We employ conjugate gradient minimisation to calculate the SLM phase pattern for a given target light potential after measuring the intensity and wavefront at the SLM. Further, we use camera feedback to reduce experimental errors, we remove optical vortices and investigate the difference between the angular spectrum method and the Fourier transform to simulate the propagation of light. Using a combination of all these techniques, we achieved more accurate and efficient light potentials compared to previous studies, and generated a series of potentials relevant for cold atom experiments. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/P009565/1, EP/T001062/1, EP/T027789/1, EP/T517811/1)","We acknowledge support by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through the Quantum Technology Hub in Quantum Computing and Simulation [grant number EP/T001062/1], the 2020-2021 Doctoral Training Partnership [EP/T517811/1],the Programme Grant DesOEQ [EP/P009565/1] and the New Investigator Grant [EP/T027789/1].

In this study, first-principles calculations are performed on the electronic properties and structural stability of single-layer (SL) VP2X2Y2 (XY = AlS, GaS and BTe). All three materials have been identified as ferromagnetic semiconductors, with their conduction band minimum situated at the K point. VP2Al2S2 and VP2Ga2S2, in particular, possess easy out-of-plane magnetization, thus facilitating a pronounced valley polarization observed in the bottom conduction band. Applying compressive strain can further modulate the orbital character of the bands as well as the valley polarization, leading to a transition from the bottom conduction band to the top valence band. Intriguingly, the strained SL VP2Al2S2 and VP2Ga2S2 exhibit a quantum anomalous Hall state with a nonzero Chern number of C=1, which is further evidenced by a quantized Hall conductance and a chiral gapless edge state connecting the valence and conduction bands. Thus, the unique electronic and topological properties of SL VP2X2Y2 suggest potential applications in the fields of electronics, spintronics, and valleytronics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Ferrovalley; First-principles calculations; MoA<sub>2</sub>Z<sub>4</sub> ; Spontaneous valley polarization","Conduction bands; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electronic properties; Ferromagnetism; Landforms; Quantum theory; Stability; Topology; Emerging applications; Ferrovalley; First principle calculations; Fundamental scientific research; Hall state; MoA2Z4; Research applications; Single layer; Spontaneous valley polarization; Topological properties; Polarization","National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, (M34022); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12074213); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2021ZD01)","The authors are grateful for support from the Open Project of National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures (Grant No. M34022 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 12074213 ), and the Major Basic Program of Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (Grant No. ZR2021ZD01 ).

Yet, obtaining links to molecular motion is challenging for many ions that relax through the quadrupolar mechanism, which is mediated by electric field gradient fluctuations and lacks a detailed microscopic description. For sodium ions in aqueous electrolytes, we combine ab initio calculations to account for electron cloud effects with classical molecular dynamics to sample long-time fluctuations, and obtain relaxation rates in good agreement with experiments over broad concentration and temperature ranges. We demonstrate that quadrupolar nuclear relaxation is sensitive to subpicosecond dynamics not captured by previous models based on water reorientation or cluster rotation. While ions affect the overall water retardation, experimental trends are mainly explained by dynamics in the first two solvation shells of sodium, which contain mostly water.

In 8Pmmn borophene the Dirac cone is furthermore tilted, which is a proxy for spacetime geometry, since the future light-cone depends on the underlying metric. Therefore it is important to understand the microscopic origin of the tilt. Here, based on ab-initio calculations, we decipher the atomistic mechanism of the formation of tilt. First, nearest-neighbor hopping on a buckled honeycomb lattice forms an upright Dirac cone. Then, the difference in the renormalized anisotropic second-neighbor hopping, formed by virtual hoppings on one-dimensional chains of atoms, tilts the Dirac cone. We construct an accurate tight-binding model on honeycomb graph for analytical investigation, and we find that substitution of certain boron atoms by carbon provides a way to change the tilt of the cone. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Honeycomb structures; Ab initio calculations; Atomic manipulation; Atomistic mechanism; Dirac cones; Dirac fermions; Lower energies; Nearest neighbor hopping; Space time geometry; Spectra's; Two-dimensional; Atoms","Sharif University of Technology, SUT; Iran's National Elites Foundation, INEF","S.

In this work, we demonstrate that self-driven intrinsic defects in 2D palladium di-selenide (PdSe2) dendrites grown at low temperature (280 °C) act as hotspots for high SERS enhancement. We grow 2D dendritic PdSe2 with ample intrinsic defects to exploit it for SERS application. X-ray electron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis reveals 9.3% outer layer and 4.7% interior Se vacancies. A detailed examination of atomic-scale defects revealed Se vacancy (VSe) coupled with Se–Pd–Se vacancy (VSe-Pd-Se) in monolayer PdSe2, and an array of line defects (Se vacancies) and nanopores in bilayer PdSe2 dendrites. Interestingly, our studies reveal that Se vacancy-rich PdSe2 gives rise to line defects that act like hotspots for SERS enhancement. Remarkably, the vacancy-rich dendritic PdSe2 shows a SERS enhancement factor >105 and can detect RhB at a concentration down to 10−8 M. We speculate that the topological line defects and the edge construction in PdSe2 dendrites act as metallic wire or edge, which is partly responsible for the high enhancement in the SERS signal. The high SERS sensitivity is explained on the basis of multiple charge transfer processes combined with the predicted metal-like behavior of the defected 2D PdSe2. Our conclusions are fully supported by the density functional theory calculation of the electronic density of states of the defective bilayer (2L) PdSe2, which remarkably exhibits metallic character. Being a defect-enabled SERS substrate, dendritic 2D PdSe2 fills the gap between conventional plasmonic SERS substrate and plasmon-free SERS substrate. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Charge transfer; Density functional theory; Precious metals; Raman scattering; Raman spectroscopy; Rhodium compounds; Substrates; Temperature; Bi-layer; Dendritics; Enhancement factor; Free surfaces; Hotspots; Intrinsic defects; Line defects; Molecular species; Self-driven; Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy; Palladium compounds","Fostering Joint Research; Kobe University; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी, (DST/INSPIRE Fellowship/2018/IF180745); Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB, (CRG/2021/006397); Ministry of Electronics and Information technology, Meity, (5(1)/2021-NANO)","The central instrumental facility, IIT Guwahati, is greatly acknowledged for TEM, AFM, and FESEM facilities.

Here we study the ground state properties of a nonlinear optical Ising machine realized by spatial light modulator, Fourier optics, and second-harmonic generation in a nonlinear crystal. By tuning the ratio of the light intensities at the fundamental and second-harmonic frequencies, we experimentally observe two distinct ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic phase transitions: a second-order phase transition where the magnetization changes to zero continuously and a first-order phase transition where the magnetization drops to zero abruptly as the effective temperature increases.

However, the capabilities of these spectroscopies are still largely unexplored due to experimental limitations and inherently weak nonlinear signals. Here, through a combination of equilibrium-nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) and a tailored spectrum decomposition scheme, we identify a relationship between the tetrahedral order of liquid water and its two-dimensional IR-IR-Raman (IIR) spectrum. The structure-spectrum relationship can explain the temperature dependence of the spectral features corresponding to the anharmonic coupling between low-frequency intermolecular and high-frequency intramolecular vibrational modes of water. In light of these results, we propose new experiments and discuss the implications for the study of tetrahedrality of liquid water. © 2023, The Author(s).","","water; decomposition; Raman spectroscopy; spectrum; temperature effect; Article; infrared radiation; liquid; molecular dynamics; Raman spectrometry; temperature dependence; terahertz spectroscopy; theoretical model; vibrational spectroscopy","National Science Foundation Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program, (CHE-1665467); Resnick Sustainability Institute for Science, Energy and Sustainability, California Institute of Technology; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (P2ELP2-199757)","Funding text 1: The authors thank Haw-Wei Lin, Roman Korol, and Vignesh C.

The state preparation and measurement of KPOs are typical requirements when used as qubits. The methods previously proposed for state preparations of KPOs utilize modulation of external fields such as a pump and drive fields. We study the stochastic state preparation of stable coherent states of a KPO with homodyne detection, which does not require modulation of external fields, and thus can reduce experimental efforts and exclude unwanted effects of possible imperfection in control of external fields. We quantitatively show that the detection data, if averaged over an optimal averaging time to decrease the effect of measurement noise, has a strong correlation with the state of the KPO, and therefore can be used to estimate the state (stochastic state preparation). We examine the success probability of the state estimation taking into account the measurement noise and bit flips. Moreover, the proper range of the averaging time to realize a high success probability is obtained by developing a binomial-coherent-state model, which describes the stochastic dynamics of the KPO under homodyne detection. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, NEDO","The authors thank T.

At the same time, conversion of nitrate to ammonia provides an attractive solution for the coupled environmental and energy challenge underlying the nitrogen cycle, by valorizing a pollutant to a carbon-free energy carrier and essential chemical feedstock. Mass transport limitations are a key obstacle to the efficient conversion of nitrate to ammonia from water streams, due to the dilute concentration of nitrate. Here, we develop bifunctional electrodes that couple a nitrate-selective redox-electrosorbent (polyaniline) with an electrocatalyst (cobalt oxide) for nitrate to ammonium conversion. We demonstrate the synergistic reactive separation of nitrate through solely electrochemical control. Electrochemically-reversible nitrate uptake greater than 70 mg/g can be achieved, with electronic structure calculations and spectroscopic measurements providing insight into the underlying role of hydrogen bonding for nitrate selectivity. Using agricultural tile drainage water containing dilute nitrate (0.27 mM), we demonstrate that the bifunctional electrode can achieve a 8-fold up-concentration of nitrate, a 24-fold enhancement of ammonium production rate (108.1 ug h−1 cm−2), and a >10-fold enhancement in energy efficiency when compared to direct electrocatalysis in the dilute stream. Our study provides a generalized strategy for a fully electrified reaction-separation pathway for modular nitrate remediation and ammonia production. © 2023, The Author(s).","","deionized water; nanosheet; nitrate; polyaniline; ammonia; concentration (composition); drainage water; electrode; energy efficiency; nitrate; pollutant removal; redox conditions; ammonia formation; Article; catalyst; controlled study; cyclic voltammetry; density functional theory; electrochemistry; electrodeposition; electron energy loss spectroscopy; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; heat treatment; hydrogen bond; isotope labeling; limit of quantitation; molecular dynamics; nitrate uptake; observation; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; scanning electron microscopy; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction","ISEE; Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment; National Alliance for Water Innovation; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CBET-1941204); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, UIUC; Advanced Manufacturing Office, AMO, (DE-FOA-0001905); Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL, (DE-AC52-07NA27344); University of Illinois System, UofI","Funding text 1: This material is based upon work supported by the National Alliance for Water Innovation (NAWI), funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Office, Advanced Manufacturing Office under Funding Opportunity Announcement DE-FOA-0001905.

Our research is methodically segmented into several stages, each designed to validate the feasibility of the proposed material. We begin by investigating the potential energy surface of MB36 clusters. Our findings reveal a preference for metallic atoms to position themselves above the central hexagonal vacancy of the B36 cluster. This factor significantly contributes to the stabilization of the resultant MB36 system. Subsequently, we employ ab-initio molecular dynamic simulations to affirm the stability of the graphene-supported MB36 clusters. In the final stage, we evaluate the system's catalytic capability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by calculating the dissociation energy of O2 and OOH post their adsorption on the M atom of the graphene-supported MB36 cluster. These simulations suggest that FeB36 could maintain stability at room temperature, exhibiting activation energies for O2 and OOH dissociation lower than those previously reported on Fe/N/C-type SACs, approaching those found on the Pt(111) surface, the most efficient ORR electrocatalyst. This computational study suggests that graphene-supported FeB36 clusters could emerge as a promising candidate for SACs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Density functional theory; Electrocatalysis; Graphene support; MB36 clusters; Oxygen reduction reaction","Activation energy; Atoms; Computation theory; Dissociation; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Graphene; Iron compounds; Molecular dynamics; Oxygen; Potential energy; Quantum chemistry; Reaction kinetics; Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation; Density-functional-theory; DFT study; Graphene support; Mb36 cluster; Metallics; Oxygen reduction reaction; Potential-energy surfaces; Single-atoms; ]+ catalyst; Density functional theory","Fenix HPC; Agenția Națională pentru Cercetare și Dezvoltare, ANCD; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT, (1211128, 1221019); Universidad Andrés Bello, UNAB; Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo, ANID","Funding text 1: We thank the financial support of the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) through FONDECYT projects 1211128 (W.T.), 1221019 (A.

However, existing QAS algorithms require calculating the ground-truth performances of a substantial number of quantum circuits during the search process, rendering them computationally demanding and limiting their applicability to large-scale quantum circuits. Recently, a predictor-based QAS has been proposed to address this challenge by estimating circuit performance directly based on their structures using a predictor trained on a set of labeled quantum circuits. However, the predictor is trained by purely supervised learning, which suffers from poor generalization ability when labeled training circuits are scarce. It is highly time-consuming to obtain a substantial number of labeled quantum circuits because the gate parameters of quantum circuits need to be optimized until convergence to obtain their ground-truth performances. To overcome these limitations, we propose GSQAS, a graph self-supervised QAS that trains a predictor by self-supervised learning. Specifically, we first pre-train a graph encoder using a well-designed pretext task on a large number of unlabeled quantum circuits, aiming to generate meaningful representations of quantum circuits. Subsequently, the downstream predictor is trained on a small set of quantum circuits’ representations and their corresponding labels. Once the encoder is trained, it becomes applicable to various downstream tasks. To effectively encode spatial topology information and avoid huge dimensions of feature vectors for large-scale quantum circuits, we propose a graph-based encoding scheme for quantum circuits. Simulation results on QAS for variational quantum eigensolver and quantum state classification demonstrate that GSQAS outperforms the state-of-the-art predictor-based QAS, yielding superior performance with fewer labeled circuits. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Quantum architecture search; Quantum machine learning; Self-supervised learning; Variational quantum algorithm; Variational quantum classifier; Variational quantum eigensolver","Encoding (symbols); Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum optics; Qubits; Signal encoding; Supervised learning; Topology; Eigensolvers; Machine-learning; Quantum algorithms; Quantum architecture; Quantum architecture search; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Self-supervised learning; Variational quantum algorithm; Variational quantum classifier; Variational quantum eigensolv; Graphic methods","Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, China, (2021ZD0302900); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61972091, 62272492); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1515011985, 2022A1515010101, 2022A1515140116)","This work is supported by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation, China (Nos. 2022A1515140116 , 2022A1515010101 , 2021A1515011985 ), Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, China (No. 2021ZD0302900 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61972091 , 62272492 ).

The qubit functional configuration is a mathematical structure that can classify the properties and behaviors of quantum circuits collectively. Major benefits of classifying quantum circuits in this way include: 1. All quantum circuits can be classified into corresponding types; 2. Each type characterizes important properties (such as circuit complexity) of the quantum circuits belonging to it; 3. Each type contains a huge collection of possible quantum circuits allowing systematic investigation of their common properties. We demonstrate the theory’s application to analyzing the hardware-efficient ansatzes of variational quantum algorithms. For potential applications, the functional configuration theory may allow systematic understanding and development of quantum algorithms based on their functional configuration types. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Basic Energy Sciences, BES, (DE-SC0019215)","S.K. and Z.H. acknowledge funding by the U.S. Department of Energy (Office of Basic Energy Sciences) under Award No. DE-SC0019215.

Within pressing temperatures 20–750 ∘C the samples maintained HH structure, however, we observed intrinsic phase separation. The material divided into three phases: stoichiometric TmNiSb, nickel-deficient phase TmNi1-xSb, and thulium-rich phase Tm(NiSb)1-y. For TmNiSb sample sintered at 1000 ∘C, we report structural transition to LiGaGe-type structure (P6 3mc, a = 4.367(3) Å, c = 7.138(7) Å). Interpretation of the transition is supported by X-ray powder diffraction, electron back-scattered diffraction, ab-initio calculations of Gibbs energy and phonon dispersion relations. Electrical resistivity measured for HH samples with phase separation shown non-degenerate behavior. Obtained energy gaps for HH samples were narrow (≤ 260 meV), while the average hole effective masses in range 0.8–2.5me. TmNiSb sample pressed at 750 ∘C achieved the biggest power factor among the series, 13 μ WK- 2cm- 1, which proves that the intrinsic phase separation is not detrimental for the electronic transport. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (2015/18/A/ST3/00057, 2021/40/Q/ST5/00066); Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza im.

Graphitic materials have been predicted to facilitate hydrodynamic heat transport with their intrinsically strong normal scattering. However, owing to the experimental difficulties and vague theoretical understanding, the observation of phonon Poiseuille flow in graphitic systems remains challenging. In this study, based on a microscale experimental platform and the pertinent occurrence criterion in anisotropic solids, we demonstrate the existence of the phonon Poiseuille flow in a 5.5 μm-wide, suspended and isotopically purified graphite ribbon up to a temperature of 90 K. Our observation is well supported by our theoretical model based on a kinetic theory with fully first-principles inputs. Thus, this study paves the way for deeper insight into phonon hydrodynamics and cutting-edge heat manipulating applications. © 2023, The Author(s).","","graphite; graphite; heat transfer; hydrodynamics; numerical model; physics; Article; heat; hydrodynamics; nonhuman; phonon; temperature; theoretical study","CREST JST, (21H04635, JPMJCR19Q3, JPMJCR20B4); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (19F19353, 19H01820, 20H00127, 21H05232, 21H05233, 21H05234, 21J12652)","X.H. acknowledges the support from the Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (Grant Number 21J12652).

We show that it is possible to implement an exponentiated sum of commuting Paulis with at most m (controlled)-rotation gates, where m is the number of distinct non-zero eigenvalues (ignoring sign). Thus we can collect mutually commuting Hamiltonian terms into groups satisfying one of several symmetries identified in this work. This allows an inexpensive simulation of the entire group of terms.

The crystalline phases and the morphology of the materials were identified with scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X‐ray diffraction and X-ray Photoelectronic spectroscopy. Contact angle measurements were performed to characterize the hydrophilicity of each material. The H2O2 electrogeneration was assessed by oxygen reduction reaction using the rotating ring-disk electrode technique. Electrochemical characterization results shown an enhancement on the H2O2 electrogeneration by NaNbO3 @CeO2/C-based materials compared to what was obtained with pure Vulcan XC72. The 1 % NaNbO3 @CeO2/C electrocatalyst presented the lower starting potential for the ORR and a 2.3 electron transfer, favoring the 2-electron mechanism and providing a higher H2O2 electrogeneration rate. Also, the enhancement of oxygen-containing functional groups showed the potential to comprehensively tune properties and optimize active sites and, consequently, increases the H2O2 electrogeneration. Density functional theory calculations indicated that NaNbO3 and CeO2 surfaces have a similar low theoretical overpotential for this reaction and that CeO2 improves the catalyst facilitating the electron transfer. These results indicate that NaNbO3 @CeO2/C-based electrocatalysts are promising materials for in situ H2O2 electrogeneration. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","CeO<sub>2</sub> nanorods; Density functional theory; Electrochemical reaction; Hydrogen peroxide electrogeneration; NaNbO<sub>3</sub> microcubes; Oxygen reduction reaction","","CCM-UFABC; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2017/10118–0, 2017/22976-0, 2019/01925–4, 2020/14100–0, 2021/05364-7, 2021/14394-7); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (88887.354751/2019–00); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (303943/2021–1, 310045/2019–3, 429727/2018–6)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank FAPESP (Grants #2017/22976-0, #2017/10118–0, #2019/01925–4, #2020/14100–0, 2021/05364-7, and 2021/14394-7), CNPq (Grants #429727/2018–6, #310045/2019–3, and #303943/2021–1), and PRH/ANP for the financial support.

Recently, α-In2Se3 was found to exhibit robust in-plane and out-of-plane ferroelectric polarizations at a monolayer thickness, which is ideal to serve as a ferroelectric component in miniaturized electronic devices. In this work, we design two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures composed of an α-In2Se3 ferroelectric and a hexagonal IV–VI semiconductor and propose an in-plane FTJ based on these heterostructures. Our first-principles calculations show that the electronic band structure of the designed heterostructures can be switched between insulating and metallic states by ferroelectric polarization. We demonstrate that the in-plane FTJ exhibits two distinct transport regimes, tunneling and metallic, for OFF and ON states, respectively, leading to a giant tunneling electroresistance effect with the OFF/ON resistance ratio exceeding 1 × 104.

Herein, we propose a theoretical and experimental study of tantalum (Ta) doping to BiVO4 leading to the introduction of hole trap states for the enhanced PEC activity. The doping of Ta is found to alter the structural and chemical surroundings via displacement of vanadium (V) atoms that cause distortions in the lattice via the formation of hole trap states. A significant enhancement of photocurrent to ∼4.2 mA cm−2 was recorded attributing to the effective charge separation of efficiency of ∼96.7 %. Furthermore, the doping of Ta in the BiVO4 lattice offers improved charge transport in bulk and decreased charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte interface. The Ta-doped BiVO4 displays the effective production of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) under AM 1.5 G illumination with a faradaic efficiency of 90 %. Moreover, the density functional theory (DFT) study confirms the decrease in optical band gap and the activation of hole trap states below the conduction band (CB) with a contribution of Ta towards both valence and CB that increases the charge separation and majority charge carrier density, respectively. The findings of this work propose that the displacement of V sites with Ta atoms in BiVO4 photoanodes is an efficient approach for enhanced PEC activity. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","BiVO<sub>4</sub>; Catalysis; Density functional theory; Hole trap states; Tantalum","Bismuth; Bismuth compounds; Charge transfer; Chemical activation; Efficiency; Electrolytes; Energy gap; Hydrogen production; Photoelectrochemical cells; Vanadium compounds; electrolyte; hydrogen; oxygen; tantalum; unclassified drug; Bismuth vanadates; Charge-separation; Density functional theory studies; Density-functional-theory; Hole trap state; Photo-activities; Photoelectrochemicals; Tantalum doping; Trap state; Water splitting; Article; catalysis; density functional theory; doping; experimental study; illumination; theoretical study; water splitting; Density functional theory","Canada Research Chair in Green Hydrogen Production; Innergex Renewable Energy Inc.; Innergex Research Chair in Renewable Hydrogen Production; Québec Ministère de l'Économie, de l'Innovation et de l'Énergie, (00393501); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Ajou University","This work was supported by Ajou University.

However, in most cases, PB data needs to be processed after a simulation to extract these observables. One of the main challenges in post-processing PB simulations is managing the large amounts of data typically generated without incurring memory or computational capacity limitations. In this work, we introduce the post-processing tool: MDSuite. This software, developed in Python, combines state-of-the-art computing technologies such as TensorFlow, with modern data management tools such as HDF5 and SQL for a fast, scalable, and accurate PB data processing engine. This package, built around the principles of FAIR data, provides a memory safe, parallelized, and GPU accelerated environment for the analysis of particle simulations. The software currently offers 17 calculators for the computation of properties including diffusion coefficients, thermal conductivity, viscosity, radial distribution functions, coordination numbers, and more. Further, the object-oriented framework allows for the rapid implementation of new calculators or file-readers for different simulation software. The Python front-end provides a familiar interface for many users in the scientific community and a mild learning curve for the inexperienced.

Lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries are considered one of the most promising next-generation “post-Li-ion” batteries, whose practical viability is still hindered by two major challenges, polysulfide shuttling and dendritic lithium growth. Coating cellulose fibers onto separators has been proven to be an effective route for solving the two challenges simultaneously. Studying the working mechanism of the cellulose fiber is important yet difficult when the battery is in operation. Here, density functional theory and molecular dynamic simulations unveiled atomistically how cellulose fiber impedes polysulfides and lithium ions passing through the fiber, mitigating polysulfide shuttling and retarding dendritic lithium growth. This cost-effective modification paves the way towards more viable, sustainable Li–S batteries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Cellulose fiber; Density functional theory; Lithium sulfur battery; Molecular dynamics; Simulation","Batteries; Cellulose; Cost Effectiveness; Growth; Lithium; Polysulfides; Simulation; Textile Fibers; Cellulose; Cost effectiveness; Density functional theory; Lithium sulfur batteries; Lithium-ion batteries; Polysulfides; Textile fibers; Cellulose fiber; Decarbonisation; Dendritics; Density-functional-theory; Dynamics simulation; Lithium/sulfur batteries; Polysulfide ions; Polysulphides; Simulation; Working mechanisms; Molecular dynamics","CF fence; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI- 1728042); Club Foundation, CF; University of Virginia, UV; Hawai'i Community Foundation, HCF; Indspire, OCF, (Li2S2)","Funding text 1: A significant observation from experiments (Fig. 2a and b) has shown that the CF-coated separator was able to suppress the corrosion of Li plates and the growth of dendritic/mossy Li. Specifically, with assistance from the CF coating, the Li anode in the CF-enabled battery (Fig. 2a) revealed a flatter surface with a higher thickness after 100 cycles compared with the Li anode in the non-CF battery (Fig. 2b). To explain the experimental observation, an MD model (Fig. 2c) was designed with four cellulose chains to mimic CF-coated separators and three lines of Li-ions between each two successive chains. For comparison, another similar MD model was set up using PP chains (Fig. S1a, supporting information). After reaching room temperature in the MD simulation, an initial velocity was applied to the Li-ions and allowed them to travel through the cellulose or PP fence until reaching the end of the simulation box (Video 1, supporting information). The processes were recorded and the final patterns on the back of the box were collected. The Li-ions were redirected when they traveled through the cellulose fence, whereas they remained on almost the same tracks when they traveled through the PP fence. The final patterns can reflect the results, where the pattern after the CF fence (Fig. 2d) was more random than the pattern after the PP fence (Fig. 2e). More specifically, the Li ions' positions after the CF fence were usually far from their original positions whereas the Li ion's positions after the PP fence were just a few angstroms from their original positions. The neighbor maps (Figs. S1b and S1c, supporting information) of the center ions can also result in the same conclusion. To simulate a more realistic scenario of Li-ion passing through a CF-coated separator, a double-fence model with both the CF fence and PP fence was designed (Fig. S1d, supporting information). A higher initial velocity was given to the Li-ions such that they could have sufficient kinetic energy to pass through both fences (Video 5, supporting information). The Li-ion patterns before the simulation, after the CF fence, and after both the CF and PP fences were recorded (Fig. S1e, supporting information). After the CF fence, most of the Li-ions were redirected. Whereas, after the PP fence, only four Li-ions (Li-ion 2, 6, 9, 12) that were very close to the PP chains were further redirected. This reveals that coating CFs on PP can further enhance the randomness of Li-ions after they travel through the separator. All these results demonstrated that CFs have much stronger interactions towards Li-ions, which redistributed the Li-ions and, as observed in experiments, resulted in a more even surface and slower Li consumption, eventually leading to a smaller chance of mossy/dendritic Li growth. This result can be reflected in section 3.3, where the interaction energy between Li ions and CFs is much higher than that between Li ions and PP. To study the interaction between the CFs and Li-ions, a DFT simulation was carried out. The result (Fig. 2f) showed that an attraction force was endowed to the cellulose chain towards Li-ions and that provided the redirection phenomenon when Li-ions passed through the cellulose fence, which is in agreement with the description in the paper [23]. The significant attraction behavior could explain the largely random redistribution in the MD simulation. In comparison, the DFT simulation using Li-ions and PP chains was also set up (Fig. S1f, supporting information). A tiny repulsion was observed during the simulation, opposite to the result of cellulose and Li-ions. This tiny repulsion could evidence the small changes in Li-ion traveling tracks in the MD simulation.To understand the mechanisms behind all phenomena observed in the experiments and MD simulations, a series of DFT simulations were carried out. Prior to that, an MD simulation to reveal the status of the CF within batteries during operation is set up for ensuring the accuracy of the DFT. An electric field was applied to the CF net model using MD (Video 4, supporting information) and the result (Fig. 4a) showed that some H+ would be easily released from the CF. Meanwhile, many H+ would move to one side, leaving the other side more negatively charged. A charge map (Fig. S3, supporting information) of the CF after the introduction of electric field was plotted to better visualize the charge difference, which revealed that most positively charged atoms (blue dots) gathered at the right side of the CF and most negatively charged atoms (red dots) remained at the left side of the CF, rendering the left surface negatively charged. Compared with that, the electric field was not able to remove H+ from the PP net, nor move H+ to one side of the PP net (Fig. S4a, supporting information). Therefore, the DFT study regarding the interactions between the cellulose and sulfides was proceeded with some H+ being removed. Each model has been separately relaxed before the DFT simulation. The DFT simulation of Li2S2 and Li2S with H-removed cellulose (HCF) (Fig. 4b) showed that the HCF was able to repel the sulfur atoms yet attract Li atoms to some degree. The attraction of the Li sites was mainly caused by the loss of H+ generating a negatively charged surface on the HCF, where the local uneven charges slightly polarized the Li2Sx (x = 1 or 2) species and eventually generated a small attraction force to the Li2Sx (x = 1 or 2) species at the Li sites. As known in the previous paper, there are also functional groups on the CFs, especially the C–OH group and –COOH group, which also lose their H+ during battery operation [23,32]. Hence, when performing DFT simulation in this study, O− was also added to represent the functional groups (C–OH) after losing the H+. With functional groups on the CF (OCF) (Fig. 4c), the repulsion to the sulfur could no longer counteract the attraction to the Li caused by the same reason as HCF, leading to connections between the OCF and the Li2S2 or Li2S. These phenomena could largely decrease the possibility of losing active materials (Li2S2 and Li2S) by repelling or even anchoring them at the cathode side and preventing them from traveling through the separators to touch the anodes and be inactivated, especially if the active materials have already detached from the cathodes due to battery operation. The attraction between the HCF and the Li ions was also observed in the previous section (Fig. 2f). For comparison, the DFT simulation regarding PP chains and the sulfides was also performed (Fig. S4b, supporting information). Compared with the DFT of the CFs and sulfides, a small repulsion was detected for both Li2S2 and Li2S with PP, which can also keep a small number of active materials at the cathode side. However, if the active materials have already traveled through the separator as polysulfides, they could hardly come back to the cathode side since PP had evenly distributed H+ at the surface and the tiny repulsion was the same when facing the anode side.Apart from the low-order polysulfides, S42−, S62−, and S82− were also studied with HCF (Fig. 4d) and OCF (Fig. 4e) using DFT, as well as the PP as reference (Fig. S4c, supporting information). For polysulfides with HCF simulation, it is worth noting that the smaller the polysulfides were, the stronger the repulsion was. More specifically, after simulation, the S42− was repelled by 0.861 Ang, the S62− was repelled by 0.694 Ang, and the S82− was repelled by 0.170 Ang. This trend was not applied to the OCF cases as the repulsion was larger when functional groups were added and the repulsion was location dependent based on the location of the functional groups. For instance, S82− was repelled by 0.588 Ang by the OCF, which is much farther than that of the HCF. S62− was also repelled by 1.732 Ang, larger than that of the HCF. For S42−, the repelling distance was smaller than that of the HCF, most likely because the location of the added functional group is already a bit far from the S42−. In addition, compared with the DFT simulation using PP towards polysulfides, it can be clearly revealed that the interactions between PP and polysulfides were much smaller. This conclusion can also be proved by the energy difference of the DFT simulations (Fig. 4f).

Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) exhibits low toxicity, biodegradability, and versatile reactivity. DMC production by direct synthesis using CO2 and methanol (CH3OH) may be one of the ever most promising green routes. On the other hand, direct synthesis of DMC shows some drawbacks including unfavorable thermochemistry and quick deactivation of catalysts. The development of new catalytic systems currently represents an urgent agenda to overcome these disadvantages. This study investigates the catalytic activity of iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) catalysts supported on alumina (AL), silica (SI), and eggshells (ES) during the course of DMC production by direct synthesis. The supported catalysts were synthesized using the impregnation method and characterized by TGA, BET, DTP-NH3, XRD, and FESEM/EDS. The contents of the impregnated iron in the matrices are ES-Fe (13%) > AL-Fe (6%) > SI-Fe (4%). The contents of the impregnated copper are ES-Cu (7%) > AL-Cu (3%) = SI-Cu (3%). The DMC conversions equal 8.9 (AL-Cu), 6.2 (SI-Cu), 11.3% (ES-Cu), 6.1 (AL-Fe), 7.2 (SI-Fe), and 12.7% (ES-Fe). The ES-Fe recycle demonstrated stability of the catalytic action in the first and second reuse, maintaining high conversion and selectivity of DMC. All tests reveal a DMC selectivity of over 99%. The reported results suggest that the catalytic DMC production depends both on the nature of D-metal and support, whereas the ES-Fe system exhibits the best performance. © 2023","Catalysts; CO<sub>2</sub>; Dimethyl carbonate; Methanol; Synthesis","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Ammonia; Biodegradability; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Catalyst activity; Catalyst supports; Copper; Iron; Silica; Synthesis gas manufacture; Chemical transformations; CO 2 concentration; Dimethyl carbonate; Dimethyl carbonate productions; Direct synthesis; Low toxicity; matrix; Metal supported; Valuable chemicals; ]+ catalyst; Methanol","Natural Gas and Biofuels Agency; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Petrobras; Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis, ANP","Funding text 1: This study was financed by Petrobras and the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES) – Finance Code 001 . ; Funding text 2: Douglas Faria thanks CAPES; Sandra Einloft thanks CNPq for research scholarship.

Here, we demonstrate the formation of large-area, single crystal and optically active 2D monoclinic gallium telluride (m-GaTe) on silicon substrate via rapid thermal annealing induced phase transformation of vdW epitaxial metastable hexagonal gallium telluride (h-GaTe). Stabilization of multilayer h-GaTe on Si occurs due to the role of the first layer symmetry together with efficient GaTe surface passivation. Moreover, we show that the phase transformation of h-GaTe to m-GaTe is accompanied by the strain relaxation between Si substrate and GaTe.

The transport behavior plays an important role in electronic devices based on semiconductors, which includes lattice thermal conductivity and carier mobility. Since impurities and defects may exist in the samples, it is difficult to investigate the intrinsic transport behavior by experimental measurements. The theoretical prediction of their transport behaviors can provide a guidance for the application of materials. In this work, we first develop machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) to explore their lattice thermal conductivities. They exhibit extremely low lattice thermal conductivity at 300 K with the values of κx = 0.122 ± 0.009∕κz = 0.103 ± 0.004 Wm−1K−1 for Cs2BiAgBr6, and κx = 0.352 ± 0.014∕κz = 0.337 ± 0.012 Wm−1K−1 for Cs2BiAgCl6, respectively. It is revealed that the thermal conductivity is mainly controlled by low-frequency phonons. Subsequently, we apply semi-empirical models to predict their mobilities. The mobility is mainly determined by the scattering from longitudinal optical phonon with the values of μe,x= 22.0/μh,x= 18.8cm2V−1s−1 for Cs2BiAgBr6, and μe,x= 19.2/μh,x= 19.5cm2V−1s−1 for Cs2BiAgCl6, respectively. The stretching between Bi and Br/Cl atoms limits the mobility.

In principle, we investigated the influence of these two fields on parameters describing the spin Hamiltonian of the system. The obtained results show that biaxial strains change the magnetic ground state between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. The mechanical strain also affects the direction and amplitude of the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). Importantly, the direction and amplitude of the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vectors are also highly tunable under external strain and electric fields. The competition between nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, MAE, and Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interactions can lead to the stabilization of various exotic spin textures and novel magnetic excitations. The high tunability of magnetic properties by external fields makes bilayer CrCl3 a promising candidate for application in the emerging field of two-dimensional quantum spintronics and magnonics. © 2023, The Author(s).","","ab initio calculation; anisotropy; article; case report; clinical article; competition; density functional theory; electric field; excitation","Norwegian Financial Mechanism 2014-2021; Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (2019/34/H/ST3/00515); Norges Forskningsråd, (262633)","This work was supported by the Norwegian Financial Mechanism 2014-2021 under the Polish-Norwegian Research Project NCN GRIEG ’2Dtronics’ No. 2019/34/H/ST3/00515.

The experiment is based on hyperbolic band theory that we confirm here in an unprecedented numerical survey of finite hyperbolic lattices. We implement hyperbolic graphene as an example of topologically nontrivial hyperbolic matter. Our work sets the stage to realize more complex forms of hyperbolic matter to challenge our established theories of physics in curved space, while the tunable complex-phase element developed here can be a key ingredient for future experimental simulation of various Hamiltonians with topological ground states. © 2023, The Author(s).","","physics; quantum mechanics; simulation; Article; geometry; physics; quantum chemistry; simulation","University of Alberta startup fund UOFAB; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (185806, ERC-StG-Neupert-757867-PARATOP); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (DGECR2021-00043, RGPIN-2021-02534); European Research Council, ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (258499086 - SFB 1170, 39085490 - EXC 2147); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","We thank A.

Ultracold atom-ion systems can provide a convenient platform for studying this problem. Here, we investigate the static properties of one and two ionic impurities in a bosonic bath using quantum Monte Carlo methods. We identify three bipolaronic regimes depending on the strength of the atom-ion potential and the number of its two-body bound states: a perturbative regime resembling the situation of a pair of neutral impurities, a non-perturbative regime that loses the quasi-particle character of the former, and a many-body bound state regime that can arise only in the presence of a bound state in the two-body potential. We further reveal strong bath-induced interactions between the two ionic polarons.

Weak measurements produce only limited information about the system, and as a result only minimally change the system’s state. Here, we theoretically and experimentally characterize quantum back-action in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates interacting with a far-from resonant laser beam. We theoretically describe this process using a quantum trajectories approach where the environment measures the scattered light and present a measurement model based on an ideal photodetection mechanism. We experimentally quantify the resulting wavefunction change in terms of the contrast of a Ramsey interferometer and control parasitic effects associated with the measurement process. The observed back-action is in good agreement with our measurement model; this result is a necessary precursor for achieving true quantum back-action limited measurements of quantum gases. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Bose-Einstein condensation; Laser beams; Quantum chemistry; Atomic Bose-Einstein condensate; Bose-Einstein condensates; Limited information; Measurement model; Model-based OPC; Quantum trajectories; Resonant laser beams; S state; Trajectory approach; Weak measurements; Statistical mechanics","Physics Frontier Center, (PHY-1430094); Quantum Leap Challenge Institute for Robust Quantum Simulation, (OMA-2120757); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST","The authors thank J.

When the coupling strength becomes large enough that the field mode frequency is reached, the deep strong coupling regime is approached, and excitations can be created from the vacuum. Here we demonstrate a periodic variant of the quantum Rabi model in which the two-level system is encoded in the Bloch band structure of cold rubidium atoms in optical potentials. With this method we achieve a Rabi coupling strength of 6.5 times the field mode frequency, which is far in the deep strong coupling regime, and observe a subcycle timescale raise in bosonic field mode excitations. In a measurement recorded in the basis of the coupling term of the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian, a freezing of dynamics is revealed for small frequency splittings of the two-level system, as expected when the coupling term dominates over all other energy scales, and a revival for larger splittings. Our work demonstrates a route to realize quantum-engineering applications in yet unexplored parameter regimes. © 2023, The Author(s).","","measurement method; parameter estimation; quantitative analysis; rubidium; article; cold stress; cross coupling reaction; excitation; freezing","Cluster of Excellence ML4Q, (EXC 2004/1 – 390534769); EPIQUS; QMiCS, (820363, 820505); Spanish Government, (PGC2018-095113-B-I00); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (277625399, 642478, We 1748-24); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12075145); Eusko Jaurlaritza, (IT986-16); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (2019SHZDZX01-ZX04); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI; Shanghai Minhang Government; University of the East, UE","We acknowledge support by the DFG within the project We 1748-24 (642478) (M.W.), the focused research center SFB/TR 185 (277625399) (M.W.) and the Cluster of Excellence ML4Q (EXC 2004/1 – 390534769) (M.W.), the QMiCS (820505) (E.S.) and OpenSuperQ (820363) (E.S.) projects of the EU Flagship on Quantum Technologies, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (12075145) (E.S.), the Shanghai Government grant STCSM (2019SHZDZX01-ZX04) (E.S.), the Spanish Government PGC2018-095113-B-I00 (MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE) (E.R.), the Basque Government IT986-16 (E.R.), and the FET Open Quromorphic (E.S.) and EPIQUS (E.S.)

The all-carbon CF10/rGO film possesses plausible tensile strength over one page of regular A4 printing paper and improved room-temperature ferromagnetism compared with the as-assembled rGO film, with saturation magnetization of about 0.327 emu/g and coercivity of about 100.4 Oe. The CF10/rGO composite with 50 wt% filler loading exhibits a good electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption performance in the measured frequency range of 2–18 GHz.

However, the required quantum resources arising from the multi-band nature of d and f electron materials remain largely unexplored. Here we compare the performance of different variational quantum eigensolvers in ground state preparation for interacting multi-orbital embedding impurity models, which is the computationally most demanding step in quantum embedding theories. Focusing on adaptive algorithms and models with 8 spin-orbitals, we show that state preparation with fidelities better than 99.9% can be achieved using about 214 shots per measurement circuit. When including gate noise, we observe that parameter optimizations can still be performed if the two-qubit gate error lies below 10−3, which is slightly smaller than current hardware levels. Finally, we measure the ground state energy on IBM and Quantinuum hardware using a converged adaptive ansatz and obtain a relative error of 0.7%. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Adaptive algorithms; Ground state; Hybrid materials; Quantum theory; Comparatives studies; Correlated materials; Eigensolvers; Embedding method; Embeddings; Impurity model; Material simulation; Orbitals; Quantum-classical; State preparation; Embeddings","Ames National Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Office of Science, SC, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); Basic Energy Sciences, BES; Iowa State University, ISU, (DE-AC02-07CH11358); Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering, DMSE","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge valuable discussions with Thomas Iadecola, Niladri Gomes, Cai-Zhuang Wang, and Nicola Lanatà.

Unexpectedly, the ZnO nanoparticles reacted with the GeTe phase to produce ZnTe and Ge impurities. Ge precipitates promoted self compensation in GeTe, which in turn reduced the Ge vacancies and decreased the carrier concentration. The resulting increase in the Seebeck coefficient led to a higher power factor, despite an increase in the electrical resistivity. Due to the optimized power factor and a lower carrier thermal conductivity, the average zT increased from 0.64 for the pure GeTe to 0.79 for GeTe + 0.5 wt.% ZnO.

This work includes two double perovskites Cs2AgBiCl6, Cs2NaBiCl6 with an indirect band gap and two double perovskites Cs2AgInCl6, Cs2NaInCl6 with a direct band gap, considered to make two groups of mixed double perovskites as Cs2Ag1-xNaxBiCl6 and Cs2Ag1-xNaxInCl6 to study the effect of cation replacement on the optical and electronic properties by employing ab-initio approach. The electronic and optical properties of these materials with x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1 have been studied, and a tunable bandgap from the smallest one to the widest one was found in both groups (1.46–2.85, 0.26–2.87) as they change with different x. The general trend of the band gap in each group shows that by reducing Ag contribution an increase in the band gap happens. But a minimum value at x = 0.25 in the first group, which is absent in the second group comprising In, is due to the different behavior of the half-full Bi-p orbital and full In-s orbital in the edge of the conduction band when the Na-s orbital introduced to the structure. In addition, the study of the absorption coefficient of each group shows that there is a possibility to find a better absorbent in the visible energy range in mixed alloys than the pristine ones. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Absorption spectra; Band structure; Density of states; Double perovskite; First principle","Bismuth compounds; Carrier lifetime; Cesium compounds; Electronic properties; Energy gap; Indium compounds; Iodine compounds; Optical properties; Perovskite; Positive ions; Silver compounds; Sodium compounds; Stability; Sulfur compounds; Charge carrier lifetime; Densities of state; Direct band gap; Double perovskites; First principles; Indirect band gap; Lead-Free; Optical and electronic properties; Orbitals; Structural stabilities; Chlorine compounds","","","A.

The architecture is based on silicon nanowire split-gate transistors which form 1d chains of spin-qubits and allow the execution of two-qubit operations among neighbors. We introduce a silicon junction which can couple four nanowires into 2d arrangements via spin shuttling and Swap operations. We then propose a modular sparse 2d spin-qubit architecture with unit cells of diagonally-oriented squares with nanowires along the edges and junctions on the corners. Targeting noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) demonstrators, we show that the proposed architecture allows for compilation strategies which outperform methods for 1d chains, and exhibits favorable scaling properties which enable trading-off compilation overhead and colocation of control electronics within each square by adjusting the nanowire length. An appealing feature of the proposed architecture is its manufacturability using complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes. © 2023, The Author(s).","","CMOS integrated circuits; MOS devices; Oxide semiconductors; Qubits; Semiconductor junctions; Silicon; 1D chain; Gate transistors; Proposed architectures; Quantum processors; Scaling-up; Scalings; Spin qubit; Split gates; Two-dimensional; Two-qubit operations; Nanowires","NISQ.OS; UKRI Innovate UK, (48482); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (688539, 951852); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (MR/V023284/1)","We thank Michael A.

For the first time, we successfully demonstrate the structural orientation of ternary Mg-Ni-Co selenide (MNCSe) by fine-tuning of solvothermal reaction temperature. Self-alignment MNCSe nanoflakes facilitates the electrochemical performance by providing porous channels and large specific area. The self-aligned star-like MNCSe-180 nanoflakes can deliver a high specific capacity of 299.16 mAh g−1 (1 A g−1) in an aqueous KOH electrolyte. Moreover, a hybrid supercapacitor device provides a high energy density of 46.56 Wh kg−1 and a maximum power density of 5.9 kW kg−1.

To compute these geometries on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, we proposed a strategy that combined a chemistry-inspired spin-restricted ansatz and a new excited state calculation method called the variational quantum eigensolver under automatically-adjusted constraints (VQE/AC). Unlike the conventional excited state calculation method, called the variational quantum deflation, the VQE/AC does not require the pre-determination of constraint weights and has the potential to describe smooth potential energy surfaces. To validate this strategy, we performed the excited state calculations at the FC and CI geometries of ethylene and phenol blue at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level of theory, and found that the energy errors were at most 2 kcal mol−1 even on the ibm_kawasaki device. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Ethylene; Geometry; Hydrogen bonds; Large scale systems; Potential energy; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Complete active space self consistent fields; Complete active space self-consistent fields; Conical intersection; Eigensolvers; Excited-states; Ground and excited state calculation; Phenol blue; Photophysical properties; Potential-energy surfaces; Quantum device; Excited states","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (20K05438, JP17H06445); Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (JPMJPF2221); Kyoto University; Institute for Molecular Science, IMS","Funding text 1: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant no.

To make entanglement distribution processes stable enough for practical and large-scale applications, it is necessary to perform them with the integrated pattern. Here, we first integrate a dense wavelength-division demultiplexing system and unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers on one large-scale photonic chip and demonstrate the multi-channel wavelength multiplexing entanglement distribution among distributed photonic chips. Specifically, we use one chip as a sender to produce high-performance and wideband quantum photon pairs, which are then sent to two receiver chips through 1-km standard optical fibers. The receiver chip includes a dense wavelength-division demultiplexing system and unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers and realizes multi-wavelength-channel energy-time entanglement generation and analysis. High quantum interference visibilities prove the effectiveness of the multi-chip system.

For instance, MXenes’ layer stability against degradative oxidation is notably reduced when stored in aqueous solutions, leading to the transformation into oxides. In this work, we study water adsorption on Ti-based MXenes by ab initio calculations. The energy gains for the molecular adsorption on Tin+1XnT2 is evaluated as a function of the termination (T = F, O, OH, mixture), the carbon/nitrogen ratio (X = C, N), the layer thickness (n) and water coverage. MXenes’ hydrophilicity tends to increase due to the presence of defects as vacancies and flake edges. We demonstrate that physical adsorption occurs through hydrogen bonding on both defect-free layers and layers containing C/N or Ti atomic vacancies, with –OH terminations providing the strongest interactions (0.40–0.65 eV). In contrast, strong water chemisorption is observed on surfaces with a single termination vacancy (0.60–1.20 eV), edges (0.75–0.85 eV), and clusters of defects (1.00–1.80 eV). We verified that the presence of undercoordinated Ti atoms on the surface is the key factor in promoting H2O chemisorption, i.e., the degradative oxidation.

The Rashba interaction is a textbook model of spin–orbit interactions, with charge carriers undergoing linear, isotropic spin-splitting in momentum space. Recently, non-centrosymmetric semiconductors in the family BiTeX (X = Cl, Br, I) have been identified as exemplary Rashba materials due to the strong splitting of their bulk bands, yet a detailed investigation of their spin textures, and their relationships to local crystal symmetry, is currently lacking. We perform high-efficiency spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to directly image the spin texture of surface states of BiTeCl, and we find dramatic deviations from idealized behavior, including a reversal of the spin-polarization near the Fermi level. We show that this behavior can be described by higher-order contributions to the canonical Rashba model with the surface states localized to individual trilayers of the crystal. Due to the prominence of these effects near the Fermi level, they should have a strong impact on the spin-dependent transport of carriers. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, GBMF, (GBMF4546); Office of Science, SC, (DE-AC02-05CH11231); Basic Energy Sciences, BES; Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering, DMSE; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (N0.11904236)","We are grateful for helpful technical discussions with C.

A recent breakthrough showed that the SCAN approximation can yield chemical accuracy for pure water in all its phases, but only when its density is corrected. This is a crucial step toward first-principles biosimulations. However, weak dispersion forces are ubiquitous and play a key role in noncovalent interactions among biomolecules, but are not included in the new approach. Moreover, naïve inclusion of dispersion in HF-SCAN ruins its high accuracy for pure water. Here we show that systematic application of the principles of density-corrected DFT yields a functional (HF-r2SCAN-DC4) which recovers and not only improves over HF-SCAN for pure water, but also captures vital noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, making it suitable for simulations of solutions. © 2023, The Author(s).","","cytosine; dimer; tropine 2 (4 chlorophenoxy)butanoate; water; accuracy assessment; chemical analysis; dispersion; simulation; accuracy; Article; density functional theory; energy; geometry; information processing; isomerization; performance; simulation","EU’s Horizon 2020 programme; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CHE-2154371); Samsung, (IO211126-09176-01); H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (101033630); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2020R1A2C2007468, NRF-2020R1A4A1017737)","E.S., S.S., Y.K., and H.Y. are grateful for support from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2020R1A2C2007468 and NRF-2020R1A4A1017737) and Samsung Electronics (IO211126-09176-01).

However, at deep magma ocean conditions carbon becomes less siderophile and thus large amounts of it may be stranded instead in the deep mantle. Here, we describe the structure and compaction mechanisms of carbonate glass to deep mantle pressures. Our results, based on non-resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, X-ray diffraction and ab initio calculations, demonstrate a pressure-induced change in hybridization of carbon from sp2 to sp3 starting at 40 GPa, due to the conversion of [3]CO32- groups into [4]CO44- units, which is completed at ~112 GPa. The pressure-induced change of carbon coordination number from three to four increases possibilities for carbon-oxygen interactions with lower mantle silicate melts. sp3 hybridized carbon provides a mechanism for changing the presumed siderophile nature of deep carbon, becoming a possible source for carbon-rich emissions registered at the surface in intra-plate and near-ridge hot spots. © 2023, The Author(s).","","carbonate rock; compaction; magma; mantle; melt; reservoir rock; rock mechanics; silicate; X-ray diffraction","European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, ESRF; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51701180, 51871201, U1802254); Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR","Funding text 1: We acknowledge the ESRF for providing synchrotron radiation and technical support at ID20, ID15a, and ID15b beamlines.

Each pair of checks uses one ancilla qubit to detect a component of the error operator and represents one layer of the technique. We build on the results on extended flag gadgets and put it on a firm theoretical foundation. We prove that this technique can recover the noiseless state under the assumption of noise not affecting the checks. The method does not incur any encoding overhead and instead chooses the checks based on the input circuit. We provide an algorithm for obtaining such checks for an arbitrary target circuit. Since the method applies to any circuit and input state, it can be easily combined with other error mitigation techniques. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods using extensive numerical simulations on 1850 random input circuits composed of Clifford gates and non-Clifford single-qubit rotations, a class of circuits encompassing most commonly considered variational algorithm circuits. We observe average improvements in fidelity of 34 percentage points with six layers of checks. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","","algorithm; article; computer simulation; human; mitigation; noise; parity; rotation; theoretical study","Argonne LDRD; FAR-QC; National Quantum Information Science Research Centers; Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research AIDE-QC; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC02-06CH11357); Office of Science, SC; Argonne National Laboratory, ANL; Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, ORISE; Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ODNI; Intelligence Community Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program; Laboratory Computing Resource Center, LCRC","Funding text 1: This research was supported in part by an appointment to the Intelligence Community Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program at Argonne National Laboratory, administered by Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education through an interagency agreement between the U.S. Department of Energy and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Our results also show that the ZnCo0.25Al1.75O4 material has a band gap of 2.60 eV which is opt for water splitting. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","First-principles; GGA+U; Photocalysis; Spinel oxide","Aluminum; Aluminum compounds; Energy gap; Photocatalytic activity; Refractive index; Zinc compounds; Al content; Band-gap values; Dielectrics property; First principles; First-principle study; GGA + U; Optical-; Photocalyse; Photocatalytic property; Spinel oxide; Cobalt compounds","Jijel University","The author appreciates the assistance of the Jijel University computer center in high-performance calculations (Alkhwarizmi HPC center).","","","Elsevier B.V.","09214526","","PHYBE","","English","Phys B Condens Matter","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171480978"

Here we propose a paradigm for bilayer materials, where covalent bonding replaces the van der Waals interaction between the layers. On the example of germanene-stanene bilayer, we show that such systems demonstrate fascinating topological properties and manifest giant capacitance effects of the order of C = 102μ F as well as dipole-like charge densities of q = 1 − 2 × 10−4μ C cm−2, showing promise for 2D ferroelectricity. The observed unique behaviour is closely linked to transverse strain-induced buckling deformations at the bilayer/substrate interface. In alternative GeSn bilayer structures with low twist angles the strain distortions trigger rich topological defect physics. We propose that the GeSn bilayer topology may be switched locally by a substrate-strain-induced electric fields. We demonstrate an approach to fabricate covalent bilayer materials, holding vast possibilities to transform applications technologies across solar, energy and optoelectronic sectors. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Capacitance; Electric fields; Germanium alloys; Semiconductor alloys; Topology; Van der Waals forces; Bi-layer; Bilayer Graphene; Bilayer materials; Capacitance effect; Covalent bonding; Germanene; Strain induced; Tunables; Twisted bilayers; Van der Waal; Tin alloys","CINECA; EU H2020, (H2020-823878); EU MSCA-RISE, (GA 823728); Royal Society, (IEC\ R2\202164, IEC\ R2\202314); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11804313); Instituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, INFN, (985 FSU-2021-030/8474000371)","Funding text 1: O.P. acknowledges financial funding from the EU MSCA-RISE project DiSeTCom (GA 823728) and INFN project TIME2QUEST.

In this article, we develop a novel self-consistent approach based on cell-centered finite-volume discretization of the Sturm-Liouville form of the effective-mass Schrödinger equation and generalized Poisson’s equation (FV-SP). We apply this approach to simulate the one-dimensional electron gas formed at the Si-SiO2 interface via a top gate. We find excellent self-consistent convergence from high to extremely low (as low as 50 mK) temperatures. We further examine the solidity of FV-SP method by changing external variables such as the electrochemical potential and the accumulative top gate voltage. Our approach allows for counting electron-electron interactions. Our results demonstrate that FV-SP approach is a powerful tool to solve effective-mass Hamiltonians. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","effective-mass; electron-electron interactions; finite-volume; one-dimensional electron gas; self-consistent approach","Electron affinity; Electron-electron interactions; Electrons; Finite volume method; Phase interfaces; Poisson equation; Silicon; Two dimensional electron gas; Effective mass; Effective mass approach; Electron-electron-interactions; Finite-volume; One-dimensional; One-dimensional electron gas; Self-consistent approach; Si-SiO 2 interface; Top gate; Ultra low temperatures; article; discretization; Silica","Summer Academy Program for International Young Scientists, (GZWZ[2022]019); Westlake University","We thank Wei Zhu and Kun Yang for very useful conversations.

This offers promising prospects for the search of new quantum materials and the study of strong correlation effects. As this platform is naturally operated by coupling the dots to an electronic reservoir, state preparation is straightforwardly achieved by driving into the steady state. Here we show that for intermediate electron-phonon coupling strength, the system with spin-polarized quantum dots undergoes a Peierls transition into an insulating regime which exhibits charge-density wave order in the steady state as a consequence of the competition between electronic Coulomb repulsive interactions and phonon-induced attractive interactions. The transport phenomena can be directly observed as fingerprints of electronic correlations. We also present powerful methods to numerically capture the physics of such an open electron-phonon system at large numbers of phonons. Our work paves the way to study and detect correlated electron-phonon physics in the nanotube quantum simulator with current experimentally accessible techniques. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Carbon Quantum Dots; Charge density; Charge density waves; Electron-phonon interactions; Electrons; Graphene quantum dots; Nanocrystals; Quantum chemistry; Semiconductor quantum dots; Simulation platform; Electron phonon; Electron-phonon coupling strengths; Peierls transition; Quantum simulations; Quantum simulators; Simulation platform; Spin-polarized; State preparation; Steady state; Strong correlation effect; Nanotubes","Barcelona Supercomputing Center MareNostrum, (FI-2022-1-0042); CCAA, (CEX2019-000910-S, MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033); European Social Fund FEDER; European Union NextGenerationEU, (PRTR-C17); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo; Fundacio Mir-Puig; Ministerio de Ciencia y Innovation Agencia Estatal de Investigaciones, (CEX2019-000910-S/10.13039/501100011033, FIDEUA PID2019-106901GB-I00, PGC2018-097027-B-I00/10.13039/501100011033); Proyectos de I+D+I, (QUSPIN RTC2019-007196-7); Fundación Cellex; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (101029393, 847648, LCF/BQ/PI19/11690013, LCF/BQ/PI20/11760031, LCF/BQ/PR20/11770012, LCF/BQ/PR21/11840013); Family Process Institute, FPI, (PCI2022-132919); Institut de Ciències Fotòniques, ICFO; HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme, (101080086 – NeQST); European Commission, EC; European Research Council, ERC; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (692876, SINPHOCOM ANR-19-CE47-0012); Generalitat de Catalunya; Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca, AGAUR, (2017 SGR 134, U16-011424); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO; Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (2016/20/W/ST4/00314); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (2017SGR1664, PCI2022-132951, RTI2018-097953-B-I00); Horizon 2020, (899794); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Fundación Mig-Puig; European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency, CINEA","Funding text 1: U.B., T.G., L.Z., and M.L. acknowledge support from: ERC AdG NOQIA; Ministerio de Ciencia y Innovation Agencia Estatal de Investigaciones (PGC2018-097027-B-I00/10.13039/501100011033, CEX2019-000910-S/10.13039/501100011033, Plan National FIDEUA PID2019-106901GB-I00, FPI, QUANTERA MAQS PCI2019-111828-2, QUANTERA DYNAMITE PCI2022-132919, Proyectos de I+D+I “Retos Colaboración” QUSPIN RTC2019-007196-7); MICIIN with funding from European Union NextGenerationEU(PRTR-C17.I1) and by Generalitat de Catalunya; Fundació Cellex; Fundació Mir-Puig; Generalitat de Catalunya (European Social Fund FEDER and CERCA program, AGAUR Grant No. 2017 SGR 134, QuantumCAT\U16-011424, co-funded by ERDF Operational Program of Catalonia 2014-2020); Barcelona Supercomputing Center MareNostrum (FI-2022-1-0042); EU Horizon 2020 FET-OPEN OPTOlogic (Grant No. 899794); EU Horizon Europe Program (Grant Agreement 101080086 – NeQST), National Science Centre, Poland (Symfonia Grant No. 2016/20/W/ST4/00314); ICFO Internal “QuantumGaudi” project; European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie-Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 101029393 (STREDCH) and No. 847648 (“La Caixa” Junior Leaders fellowships ID100010434: LCF/BQ/PI19/11690013, LCF/BQ/PI20/11760031, LCF/BQ/PR20/11770012, LCF/BQ/PR21/11840013).

The electronic interactions in these superlattices, strongly dependent on the periodicity and symmetry of the moiré pattern, critically determine the emergent properties and phase diagrams. To date, the relative twist angle between two layers has been the primary tuning parameter for a given choice of constituent crystals. Here, we establish strain as a powerful mechanism to in situ modify the moiré periodicity and symmetry. We develop an analytically exact mathematical description for the moiré lattice under arbitrary in-plane heterostrain acting on any bilayer structure. We demonstrate the ability to fine-tune the moiré lattice near critical points, such as the magic angle in bilayer graphene, or fully reconfigure the moiré lattice symmetry beyond that imposed by the unstrained constituent crystals. Due to this unprecedented simultaneous control over the strength of electronic interactions and lattice symmetry, 2D heterostrain provides a powerful platform to engineer, tune, and probe strongly correlated moiré materials. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Electronic interactions; Emergent property; Large-scales; Lattice symmetry; Moire pattern; Reconfigurable; Twist angles; Two-dimensional; Two-layer; Universal platform; Crystal symmetry","Royal Academy of Engineering, RAENG; Royal Society; European Research Council, ERC, (725920); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (DI 2013/5-1, EXS-2089, EXS-2111, FI 947/8-1, SPP-2244)","P.S., A.V.S., and J.J.F. gratefully acknowledge the German Science Foundation (DFG) for financial support via grants FI 947/8-1, DI 2013/5-1, and SPP-2244, as well as the clusters of excellence MCQST (EXS-2111) and e-conversion (EXS-2089).

The phase transitions between these structures play an important role in the production of durable and functional metal alloys. Despite their technological significance, the details of such phase transitions are largely unknown because of the challenges associated with probing these processes. Here, we describe the nanoscopic details of an fcc-to-bcc phase transition in PdCu alloy nanoparticles (NPs) using in situ heating transmission electron microscopy. Our observations reveal that the bcc phase always nucleates from the edge of the fcc NP, and then propagates across the NP by forming a distinct few-atoms-wide coherent bcc–fcc interface. Notably, this interface acts as an intermediate precursor phase for the nucleation of a bcc phase. These insights into the fcc-to-bcc phase transition are important for understanding solid − solid phase transitions in general and can help to tailor the functional properties of metals and their alloys. © 2023, The Author(s).","","copper nanoparticle; palladium nanoparticle; alloy; heating; inorganic compound; nanoparticle; Article; controlled study; crystal structure; heating; molecular dynamics; phase transition; precursor; solid; synthesis; transmission electron microscopy","Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR; National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF, (NRF-CRP23-2019-0001); Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE, (RG87/19); École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, EPFL","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Singapore National Research Foundation’s Competitive Research Program funding (NRF-CRP23-2019-0001).

The Y(θ) value for all M2X3 materials exceeds 67 N/m, with Al2S3 exhibiting the best mechanical strength, surpassing to that of MoS2 (∼124.3 N/m in the x and y directions). Phonon calculations reveal that the acoustic branch with the lowest frequency is mainly dominated by out-of-plane vibrations of the metal atoms and non-metallic atoms. Ga2Te3 exhibits dynamic instability due to the softening of the optical phonon branch. Incorporating spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in In2Se3 and In2Te3 converts them into direct semiconductors. These materials possess an electrostatic potential difference ranging from 0.73 to 2.11 eV, which effectively reduces the band gap required for water splitting in the infrared region. Moreover, the M2X3 monolayers with intrinsic electric fields are great coveted photocatalysts for overall water splitting. Remarkably, In2Se3 displays a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 28.6%, which is significant for commercial applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Electronic structures; Optical properties; Phonon modes; Photocatalytic water splitting; Two-dimensional materials","Aluminum compounds; Electric fields; Energy gap; Gallium compounds; Layered semiconductors; Molybdenum compounds; Optical properties; Phonons; Semiconducting selenium compounds; Solar power generation; Sulfur compounds; Electronic and optical properties; Electronic.structure; First principle calculations; Mechanical; Phonon calculation; Phonon mode; Photocatalytic water splitting; Two-dimensional; Two-dimensional materials; Water splitting; Electronic structure","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11074059, 11204053, 52227813)","The research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52227813 , 11204053 and 11074059 ).

Here, we report on the observation of a thermal Hall conductivity in a non-magnetic elemental insulator, with an amplitude exceeding what has been previously observed. In black phosphorus (BP), the longitudinal (κii), and the transverse, κij, thermal conductivities peak at the same temperature and at this peak temperature, the κij/κjj/B is ≈ 10−4−10−3 T−1. Both these features are shared by other insulators displaying THE, despite an absolute amplitude spreading over three orders of magnitude. The absence of correlation between the thermal Hall angle and the phonon mean-free-path imposes a severe constraint for theoretical scenarios of THE. We show that in BP a longitudinal and a transverse acoustic phonon mode anti-cross, facilitating wave-like transport across modes. The anisotropic charge distribution surrounding atomic bonds can pave the way for coupling between phonons and the magnetic field. © 2023, The Author(s).","","phosphorus; acoustic data; anisotropy; chemical bonding; correlation; coupling; electrical conductivity; phosphorus; anisotropy; Article; magnetic field; phonon; temperature; thermal conductivity","Bruce Normand; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR-19-CE30-0014-04); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (19H01840); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11574097, 12004123, 51861135104); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2020M682386); Grand Équipement National De Calcul Intensif, GENCI, (A0130913028); National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFA1403503); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2019kfyXMBZ071)","Funding text 1: We thank Bruce Normand and Wei Ji for authorizing us to use Fig. 4 c.

At the nanoscale, BHF nanoparticles grow in the form of platelets, characterized by a low thickness along its principal magnetization axis (c-axis), displaying uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with the easy axis pointing perpendicular to the platelet. This unique property of BHF nanoplatelets has lead to a variety of novel applications, which often require surface functionalization. However, it has been observed that the nanoplatelets display two different surface morphologies depending on the stage/conditions of preparation. To ground these experimental observations, we employ the ab initio thermodynamics framework to perform a systematic investigation of the thermodynamic stability of BHF bulk terminations under a wide range of chemical conditions. We calculate the surface phase diagrams of pristine and hydroxylated bulk terminations along the c-axis. For pristine terminations, two different iron terminated surfaces are preferred: the barium containing 2b termination (Ba-rich conditions) and the 4f2 iron terminated surface (Ba-poor conditions). In the presence of water, the hydroxylated oxygen-terminated surfaces (12k-O) are identified as the most stable ones at Ba-poor conditions and low pH values, whereas the hydroxylated 2b surface is preferred at high pH and Ba-rich conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Atomistic thermodynamics; Barium hexaferrite; DFT; Hydroxylation; Surface stability","Ferrite; Hydroxylation; Magnetic anisotropy; Nanomagnetics; Phase diagrams; Platelets; Thermodynamic stability; Atomistic thermodynamics; Barium hexaferrites; Bulk termination; Condition; DFT; Nanoplatelet; Rich conditions; Surface from; Surface phasis; Surface stability; Iron","CINECA; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (899285); European Commission, EC; Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS, ARRS, (P2-0089)","Funding text 1: The study was partly funded from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme by the project MAGNELIQ under grant agreement no. 899285 from the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation HORIZON 2020.

Long-range interactions play an important role in nature; however, quantum simulations of lattice systems have largely not been able to realize such interactions. A wide range of efforts are underway to explore long-range interacting lattice systems using polar molecules 2–5, Rydberg atoms 2,6–8, optical cavities 9–11 or magnetic atoms 12–15. Here we realize novel quantum phases in a strongly correlated lattice system with long-range dipolar interactions using ultracold magnetic erbium atoms. As we tune the dipolar interaction to be the dominant energy scale in our system, we observe quantum phase transitions from a superfluid into dipolar quantum solids, which we directly detect using quantum gas microscopy with accordion lattices. Controlling the interaction anisotropy by orienting the dipoles enables us to realize a variety of stripe-ordered states. Furthermore, by transitioning non-adiabatically through the strongly correlated regime, we observe the emergence of a range of metastable stripe-ordered states. This work demonstrates that novel strongly correlated quantum phases can be realized using long-range dipolar interactions in optical lattices, opening the door to quantum simulations of a wide range of lattice models with long-range and anisotropic interactions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","anisotropy; lattice dynamics; quantum mechanics","Army Research Office Defense University, (W911NF2010104); FAS Division of Science Research Computing Group at Harvard University; Office of Naval Research Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, (DGE2140743, N00014-18-1-2863, W911NF-20-1-0021); US Department of Energy Quantum Systems Accelerator, (DE-AC02-05CH11231); National Science Foundation, NSF; Center for Ultracold Atoms, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, CUA, (PHY-1734011)","Funding text 1: We wish to acknowledge V.

Namely, those applicable to systems with many degrees of freedom, without requiring a number of measurements or computational resources to analyze the data that scale exponentially with the system size. We begin with introducing the concepts of quantum entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, and Bell nonlocality in the bipartite scenario, to then present their multipartite generalization. We review recent progress on characterizing these quantum correlations from partial information on the system state, such as through data-driven methods or witnesses based on low-order moments of collective observables. We then review state-of-the-art experiments that demonstrate the preparation, manipulation and detection of highly-entangled many-body systems. For each platform (e.g. atoms, ions, photons, superconducting circuits) we illustrate the available toolbox for state preparation and measurement, emphasizing the challenges that each system poses. To conclude, we present a list of timely open problems in the field. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","atomic ensembles; Bell nonlocality; data-driven methods; entanglement detection; many-body systems; quantum entanglement; quantum gases","article; degree of freedom; gas; human; photon","101017733Proyectos de I+D+I, (RTC2019-007196-7); Barcelona Supercomputing Center MareNostrum, (101113690, FI-2023-1-0013, PASQuanS2.1); European Social Fund FEDER; European Union NextGenerationEU, (PRTR-C17, QUANTERA MAQS PCI2019-111828-2); European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR, (PCI2022-132919); Fundación Cellex; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (101029393, 101031549, 847648, ID100010434, LCF/BQ/PI19/11690013, LCF/BQ/PI20/11760031, LCF/BQ/PR20/11770012, LCF/BQ/PR21/11840013); Institut de Ciències Fotòniques, ICFO; HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme, (101080086—NeQST); European Research Council, ERC, (CEX2019-000910-S/10.13039/501100011033, FIDEUA PID2019-106901GB-I00, PGC2018-0910.13039/501100011033); Branco Weiss Fellowship – Society in Science; Generalitat de Catalunya; Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, ETH; Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca, AGAUR, (2021 SGR 01452, U16-011424); Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (2016/20/W/ST4/00314); Horizon 2020, (899794); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Fundación Mig-Puig","Funding text 1: I F acknowledges support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie-Skłodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No. 101031549 (QuoMoDys). ; Funding text 2: M L acknowledges support from: ERC AdG NOQIA; MICIN/AEI (PGC2018-0910.13039/501100011033, CEX2019-000910-S/10.13039/501100011033, Plan National FIDEUA PID2019-106901GB-I00, FPI; MICIIN with funding from European Union NextGenerationEU (PRTR-C17.I1): QUANTERA MAQS PCI2019-111828-2); MCIN/AEI/ 10.13039/501100011033 and by the ‘European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR’ QUANTERA DYNAMITE PCI2022-132919 within the QuantERA II Programme that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 101017733Proyectos de I+D+I ‘Retos Colaboración’ QUSPIN RTC2019-007196-7); Fundació Cellex; Fundació Mir-Puig; Generalitat de Catalunya (European Social Fund FEDER and CERCA program, AGAUR Grant No. 2021 SGR 01452, QuantumCAT U16-011424, co-funded by ERDF Operational Program of Catalonia 2014-2020); Barcelona Supercomputing Center MareNostrum (FI-2023-1-0013); EU (PASQuanS2.1, 101113690); EU Horizon 2020 FET-OPEN OPTOlogic (Grant No. 899794); EU Horizon Europe Program (Grant Agreement 101080086—NeQST), National Science Centre, Poland (Symfonia Grant No. 2016/20/W/ST4/00314); ICFO Internal ‘QuantumGaudi’ project; European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie-Skłodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No. 101029393 (STREDCH) and No. 847648 (‘La Caixa’ Junior Leaders fellowships ID100010434: LCF/BQ/PI19/11690013, LCF/BQ/PI20/11760031, LCF/BQ/PR20/11770012, LCF/BQ/PR21/11840013).

Topological node-line semimetals (TNLSMs), anticipated as a fertile ground for exploring electronic correlation effects due to the anisotropy associated with their node-line structure, have recently attracted considerable attention. In this study, we report an experimental observation for correlation effects in TNLSMs realized by black phosphorus (BP) under hydrostatic pressure. By performing a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and band calculations on compressed BP, a magnetic-field-induced electronic instability of Weyl-like fermions is identified under an external magnetic field parallel to the so-called nodal ring in the reciprocal space. Anomalous spin fluctuations serving as the fingerprint of electronic instability are observed at low temperatures, and they are observed to maximize at approximately 1.0 GPa. This study presents compressed BP as a realistic material platform for exploring the rich physics in strongly coupled Weyl-like fermions. © 2023, Science China Press.","black phosphorus; electronic correlation effect; nuclear magnetic resonance; topological node-line semimetal","Nuclear magnetic resonance; Phosphorus; Spin fluctuations; Topology; Band dispersions; Condensed-matter physics; Correlation effect; Electronic correlation effects; Electronic instabilities; Field-induced; Lines structures; Magnetic-field; Resonance band; Topological node-line semimetal; Hydrostatic pressure","Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies, (AHY160000); Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences; National Key R&D Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, (2016YFA0303000, 2017YFA0300201); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11534010); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (QYZDY-SSW-SLH021)","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant Nos. 2017YFA0300201, and 2016YFA0303000), the Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies (Grant No. AHY160000), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11534010), and the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China (Grant No. QYZDY-SSW-SLH021).

All samples prepared by the solid-state reaction method were formed in the single-phase monoclinic and rhombohedral perovskite oxides. Using the First Principle calculations of density functional theory, the effect of Sb substitution on band gap broadening was examined and a reasonable correlation was found with the experimental results. The photocatalytic activities were studied from the MB and IPA decomposition experiment. It was observed that Ba2Bi3+(Bi1−2x5+Sb2x5+)O6 exhibited better MB degradation performance under Sb substitution accompanied by the formation of nanoparticles. IPA decomposition result supports this finding and suggested that smaller particles in the Sb substituted samples reasonably affect the CO2 evolution performance.The maximum MB decomposition rate (about 50%) was found for the 20% Sb-incorporated sample. In contrast to the previously reported rare-earth-based double perovskite photocatalyst, a comparable performance was obtained in this research. The excellent surface morphology associated with the smaller particle sizes and better crystallinity for the Sb substituted sample promoted more active sites that facilitated improved photocatalytic activities of Ba2Bi3+(Bi1−2x5+Sb2x5+)O6 double perovskite. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Nanoparticles; Photocatalytic property; Rare earth-free materials; Tolerance factor","Antimony; Crystallinity; Density functional theory; Energy gap; Morphology; Perovskite; Photocatalytic activity; Rare earths; Solid state reactions; Surface morphology; Double perovskite oxide; Double perovskites; Free materials; Optical-; Performance; Photocatalytic activities; Photocatalytic property; Rare earth-free material; Rare-earth-free; Tolerance factor; Nanoparticles","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (JP19K04995, JP21K05140)","This research was partially financed by MEXT Grands-in-Aid for Scientific Research (JPSJ KAKENHI Grants No. JP19K04995 and JP21K05140 ).

However, generating these nonclassical states of light, especially with high intensity and a high degree of squeezing, is challenging. To address this problem, we introduce a new concept which uses gain to generate intense sub-Poissonian light at optical frequencies. It exploits a strongly nonlinear gain for photons which arises from a combination of frequency-dependent gain and Kerr nonlinearity. In this laser architecture, the interaction between the gain medium and Kerr nonlinearity suppresses the spontaneous emission at high photon number states, leading to a strong ""negative feedback""that suppresses photon-number fluctuations. We discuss realistic implementations of this concept based on the use of solid-state gain media in laser cavities with Kerr nonlinear materials, showing how 90% squeezing of photon number fluctuations below the shot noise level can be realized.  © 2023 American Physical Society.","","Natural frequencies; Nonlinear optics; Optical Kerr effect; Photons; Quantum chemistry; Quantum optics; Shot noise; As numbers; Gain medium; Kerr nonlinearity; Kerrnonlinearities; Nonclassical states of light; Nonlinear gains; Optical frequency; Photon number fluctuations; Quantum information processing; Shot-noise level; Optical materials","Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies, (W911NF-23-2-0121); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-20-1-0115); Army Research Office, ARO","This material is based upon work supported in part by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under Grant No. FA9550-20-1-0115; the work is also supported in part by the U.S. Army Research Office through the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies at MIT, under Collaborative Agreement No. W911NF-23-2-0121.

The combination of experimental and theoretical analysis revealed enhanced photocatalytic activity of the PGBT composite, which could be attributed to (i) the interaction of BaTiO3 nanoparticles with PG sheets via Ba–C bond, (ii) reduced band gap due to the introduction of hybridized states leading to increased absorption in visible range and (iii) large surface area which provides more active sites for the efficient adsorption of MB dye. The formation of Ba–C bond proved to be highly advantageous for the efficient transport of photogenerated charge carriers, thereby suppressing the recombination of charge carriers. The synthesized nanocomposite showed three times higher photodegradation efficiency compared to BaTiO3. In addition to this, the composite also showed an excellent cyclic stability indicating its suitability as an effective photocatalyst for the environmental remediation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Barium titanate; Density functional theory; Methylene blue; Nanocomposite; Photocatalysis; Porous graphene","Aromatic compounds; Barium titanate; Charge carriers; Charge transfer; Efficiency; Energy gap; Graphene; Nanocomposites; Photocatalytic activity; Density-functional-theory; Methylene Blue; Methylene blue dye; One pot; Performance; Photocatalytic activities; Photoresponses; Porous graphene; Simple++; Synthesised; Density functional theory","Scoliosis Research Society, SRS; Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB","The author USS acknowledges the financial support received from Science and Engineering Research Board , Government of India under SRS scheme.

This progress is motivating the development of a new generation of optical control systems that can manipulate the light field with high fidelity at wavelengths relevant for AMO applications. These systems are characterized by criteria: (C1) operation at a design wavelength of choice in the visible (VIS) or near-infrared (IR) spectrum, (C2) a scalable platform that can support large channel counts, (C3) high-intensity modulation extinction and (C4) repeatability compatible with low gate errors, and (C5) fast switching times. Here, we provide a pathway to address these challenges by introducing an atom control architecture based on VIS-IR photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology. Based on a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor fabrication process, this atom-control PIC (APIC) technology can meet system requirements (C1)-(C5). As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a 16-channel silicon-nitride-based APIC with .5.8±0.4/ ns response times and >30 dB extinction ratio at a wavelength of 780 nm.  © 2023 Optica Publishing Group.","","Atom lasers; CMOS integrated circuits; Infrared devices; MOS devices; Oxide semiconductors; Photonic devices; Photonic integration technology; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Silicon nitride; Silicon photonics; Timing circuits; Cold atoms; Cold ions; Emerging applications; High-fidelity; Integrated circuit technology; Laser technologies; Light control; Optical physics; Photonics Integrated Circuits; Quanta computers; Atoms","ONISQ; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMR-1747426); U.S. Department of Defense, DOD; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; Belgian American Educational Foundation, BAEF; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, AvH; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate, NDSEG","Funding.

In particular we have considered the +Ω and +Σ cubic arrangements of (10,0) carbon nanotubes at different Li content and pressure at both cryogenic (T=100K) and room (T=300K) temperatures. The adsorption isotherms with different Li content have been calculated by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations using accurate parameters for the Li−H2 interaction that were previously obtained on the basis of density functional theory calculations. We show that for the lighter +Σ〈111〉 cubic arrangement, Li doping is able to enhance the hydrogen uptake at such an extent that the U.S. Department of Energy ultimate gravimetric target is exceeded at room temperature and P=10MPa. We also find that heavy Li doping (greater than 20% of carbon atoms) becomes detrimental in terms of gravimetric adsorption performances because the H2 uptake increase is overcompensated by the heaviness of the absorbing medium. The system volumetric capacity improvement is not as good as the gravimetric and is still not sufficient to fulfill the needs of onboard hydrogen storage for light-duty fuel cell vehicles in the thermodynamic and Li content ranges explored. © 2023 The Author(s)","Carbon nanotubes; doping; Grand canonical Monte Carlo; Hydrogen storage; Multi-scale; Nanoporous media","Density functional theory; Fuel cells; Gas adsorption; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN); Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation; Grand-canonical Monte Carlo; Gravimetric capacity; Hydrogen adsorption; Li content; Li doped carbon nanotubes; Li doping; Multi-scales; Nano-porous media; Single-walled carbon; Hydrogen storage","","","G.

The spin dimer shows a periodic longitudinal relaxation between the initial and inverted spin spiral state. The calculations were accomplished analytically using a coordinate transfer to local coordinates. Additionally, the dimer is investigated numerically by solving the Gisin–Schrödinger equation. The influence of damping and an external magnetic field perpendicular to the spiral plane has been considered. The spin dynamics were categorized into classical and quantum mechanical spin dynamics. In order to distinguish between classical and quantum spin states, the von Neumann entropy was calculated, which characterizes the entanglement change during the longitudinal reversal. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Gisin–Schrödinger equation; Longitudinal relaxation; Spin dimer","","NUIST, China, (2018r043)","R.

Graphene (G) grown on Ni(100) forms a striped moiré pattern of valleys, where G approaches the nickel substrate and interacts with it rather strongly, and ridges, where G stays far away from the substrate and acts almost free-standing. Combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements, we show that this peculiar moiré constitutes a regular nanostructured template on a 2D support, confining in 1D trails single metal atoms and few atoms clusters. DFT calculations show that the confinement is selective and highly dependent on the atomic species, with some species preferring to adsorb on ridges and the other showing preference for valleys. Co and Au adsorbates, for instance, have opposite behavior, as predicted by DFT and observed by STM. The origin of such disparate behavior is traced back to the electrostatic interaction between the charged adsorbate and the nickel surface. Moreover, the selectivity is not restricted to the adsorption process only, but persists as adsorbate starts its diffusion, resulting in unidirectional mass transport on a continuous 2D support. These findings hold great promise for exploiting tailored nanostructured templates in a wide range of potential applications involving mass transport along element-specific routes. © 2023 The Author(s)","Cobalt; Graphene; Moiré; Numerical simulations; Scanning tunneling microscopy","Atoms; Cobalt; Density functional theory; Nickel; Scanning tunneling microscopy; Transportation routes; Atom clusters; Atomic species; Density-functional theory calculations; Free standings; Metal atoms; Moire; Moire pattern; Nano-structured; Nickel substrates; Single metal atoms; Graphene","CINECA; Fondazione ICSC; NGEU; National Recovery and Resilience Plan; PNRR; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (2017KFY7XF, 2017NYPHN8); Ministero degli Affari Esteri e della Cooperazione Internazionale, MAECI; Università degli Studi di Trieste, UniTS; Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, SASA, (F-18)","Funding text 1: We acknowledge financial support from MAECI, Italy (Executive Programme with Serbia 2019–2021) and MIUR, Italy (PRIN Bando 2017 – grants n. 2017KFY7XF and n. 2017NYPHN8 ).

There are important limitations in the synthesis of highly ordered COFs, such as the shape and packing of the building blocks. Thus, the presence of fluorine atoms that lie perpendicular to the bisecting plane of BODIPY derivatives together with the presence of four bulky methyl groups could hinder the crystallization process in COF synthesis. For that reason, BODIPY-based COFs are rarely incorporated to COF networks. In this work, following the mixed linker strategy, a pre-synthetic method to dope COF structures with BODIPY units was developed. The materials have been processed into fluorescent Covalent Organic Nanosheets (CONs) with defined particle-size distributions around 100 nm, suitable for cellular biomedical applications. The viability of the CONs was evaluated using Sk-Mel-103 cells, demonstrating the internalization showing 100% cell viability. We envisage that this work could accelerate the discovery of new COF-based materials for biomedical sciences. © 2023","BODIPY; COF; Doping; Frameworks; Internalization","Cells; Crystallization; Hardiness; Materials; Networks; Particle Size; Processes; Synthesis; Medical applications; Nanocrystalline materials; Biomedical applications; BODIPY; Building blockes; Covalent organic frameworks; Fluorine atoms; Framework; Internalization; Methyl group; Novel strategies; Organics; Particle size","Comunidad de Madrid, (S2018/NMT-4367, Y2020/NMT-6469); European Commission, EC, (Core3 881603); Generalitat Valenciana, GVA, (CIPROM/2021/007); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (PID2019-106268GB-C33, PID2020-113142RB-C21, PID2020-114755GB-C32, PID2021-126304OB-C41, PLEC2021-007906, TED2021-129886B-C43); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This work was financially supported by Spanish MICINN ( PID2019-106268GB-C33 , TED2021-129886B-C43 , PID2020-114755GB-C32 , PID2020-113142RB-C21 and PLEC2021-007906 ), as well as by project PID2021-126304OB-C41 via MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033/, by European Regional Development Fund - A way of doing Europe and by the Generalitat Valenciana (CIPROM/2021/007).

In this Tutorial, we first introduce the nonlinear interactions of magnons in pure magnetic systems and hybrid magnon-phonon and magnon-photon systems. Then, we show how these nonlinear interactions can generate exotic magnonic phenomena. In the classical regime, we will cover the parametric excitation of magnons, bistability and multistability, and magnonic frequency comb. In the quantum regime, we will discuss the single-magnon state, Schrödinger cat state, and the entanglement and quantum steering among magnons, photons, and phonons. The applications of the hybrid magnonics systems in quantum transducer and sensing will also be presented. Finally, we look at the future development direction of nonlinear magnonics. © 2023 Author(s).","","Phonons; Quantum entanglement; Textures; Bi-stability; Frequency combs; Magnetic system; Magnon state; Magnons; Multistability; Nonlinear interactions; Parametric excitations; Photon qubits; Spin textures; Photons","Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (12174329, 2021ZD0301500, 92265202); Key R&D Program of Guangdong Province, (2018B030329001); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (101018193); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12147148, 12204441); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (11975026, 12125402, 2020M680186); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFA1402802); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2021FZZX001-02)","This work was funded by the National Key R&D Program under Contract No. 2022YFA1402802 and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Marie Skłodowska-Curie Grant Agreement SPINCAT No. 101018193.

This study proposes and implements a pairwise-parallel gate scheme on a trapped-ion quantum computer. The gates are driven simultaneously on different sets of orthogonal motional modes of a trapped-ion chain. This work demonstrates the utility of this scheme by creating a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state in one step using parallel gates with one overlapping qubit. It also shows its advantage for circuits by implementing a digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of an interacting spin system, the transverse-field Ising model. This method effectively extends the available gate depth by up to two times with no overhead when no overlapping qubit is involved, apart from additional initial cooling. This scheme can be easily applied to different trapped-ion qubits and gate schemes, broadly enhancing the capabilities of trapped-ion quantum computers. © 2023 The Authors.

The structural stability was studied at optimized rotation angles (ϕ) = 0∘, 16.10∘, 21.79∘, 38.21∘, 43.90∘ and 60∘. The heterostructure shows semiconducting nature at ϕ=0∘, 21.79∘ and 38.21∘. These twisted heterostructures have demonstrated extraordinary mechanical properties such as Young's modulus and bulk modulus. Using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory, it is observed that the Seebeck coefficient, electric conductivity, and power factor at ϕ=0∘, 21.79∘, 38.21∘, and 60∘ are much higher than the values measured at ϕ=16.10∘ and 43.90∘. Moreover, at ϕ=60∘, the Power Factor for the n-type dopants can reach 1.37 × 1011 W/msK2. The lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature is found to be very low for ϕ=16.10∘, 21.79∘, 43.90∘ and 38.21∘ rotation angles. An ultralow lattice thermal conductivity with a value of 0.095 W/mK at 300K has been observed for 21.79∘ rotation angle, which is lower than other rotation angles because of very low group velocity (22.1 km/s) and short phonon lifetime (∼0.12 ps). The high thermoelectric performance results from an ultralow thermal conductivity arising due to the strong lattice anharmonicity. The present observations can offer significant impact on the design of high performance thermoelectric materials based on twisted van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2d materials; MoS<sub>2</sub>/WS<sub>2</sub> ; Transition metal dichalcogenides; Twisted heterostructures","Boron nitride; Crystal lattices; Elastic moduli; Electric power factor; Graphene; Layered semiconductors; Nitrides; Rotation; Stability; Statistical mechanics; Thermal conductivity; Thermal Engineering; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; Transition metals; Van der Waals forces; 2d material; Dichalcogenides; Lattice thermal conductivity; MoS2/WS2; Power factors; Rotation angles; Strain engineering; Thermoelectric performance; Transition metal dichalcogenides; Twisted heterostructure; Molybdenum compounds","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST, (CRG/2019/003289, DST/INSPIRE/04/2015/003087, ECR/2017/002223); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India, CSIR; UGC-DAE Consortium for Scientific Research, University Grants Commission, UGC-DAE CSR, (CRS-M-321, CSR-IC-263); Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi, IIT (BHU)","NG acknowledges the DST INSPIRE (No. IF200524 ) for financial assistance.

However, the interpretation of the pseudocapacitance and charge storage mechanism in GO and its derivatives is still debated and is yet to be understood. Here, we report a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism in GO and electrochemically reduced GO electrodes using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy combined with first principles calculations. Contrary to conventional believes, our results reveal that pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism is due to conduction built by the electron delocalization region in GO during reduction rather than localized electron transfer. It is observed that the removal of oxygen functional groups from the surface of the GO leads to decrease in diffusion current and the reconstructed electron delocalization region contributes to increased specific capacitance. This work provides a clear and fundamental understanding of pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanisms in GO derivatives that will be also helpful in exploration of GO-based novel and hybrid electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Charge storage mechanism; Density functional theory; Graphene oxide; Supercapacitors","Cyclic voltammetry; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrons; Graphene; Hybrid materials; Storage (materials); Supercapacitor; Charge storage; Charge storage mechanism; Density-functional-theory; Electrochemically reduced graphene; Electron delocalization; Graphene oxides; Performance; Pseudocapacitive; Reduced graphene oxides; Storage mechanism; Density functional theory","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST, (AV/VRI/2022/0338); Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB; Ministry of Education, India, MoE","Funding text 1: Author (KRK) acknowledges the financial support from Ministry of Education, India.

Modeled as a Rabi dimer, the device comprises of two interacting transmission-line resonators, each coupled to a qubit. The qubits, driven by independent harmonic fields, are further modulated by a micromechanical resonator mimicked by a phonon mode. The impacts of two independent driving fields on the qubit dynamics are carefully examined. The energy diagram of the system and the photon number mobilization on the resonators are analyzed to explain the behavior of the LZ transitions and qubit dynamics while taking into account the influence of the single phonon mode. Results show that low phonon frequencies can alter the qubit dynamics, particularly in the absence of the driving fields, and a strong phonon coupling strength can significantly perturb the qubit dynamics, thanks to a high influx of phonon energy. Notably, only the photon frequency affects the oscillation frequency of qubit polarization. This study unveils the imperative roles that photons and phonons play in the Rabi dimer model. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","Landau–Zener transition; multiple Davydov Ansätze; quantum electrodynamics; Rabi model; time-dependent variation","Electrodynamics; Phonons; Qubits; Driving field; Landau-zener transitions; Multiple davydov ansatze; Phonon mode; Quantum electrodynamics; Rabi model; Time dependent; Time dependent variations; Tunables; Variational principles; Photons","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund, (RG87/20); Nanyang Technological University, NTU","Support for this project from the Nanyang Technological University under the Undergraduate Research Experience on CAmpus (URECA) programme and from the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund (Grant No. RG87/20) is gratefully acknowledged.

Application developers, on the other hand, leverage novel methods to improve the efficiency of their own codes: a recent trend is the use of floating-point mixed precision, or the careful interlocking of single- and double-precision arithmetic, as a tool to improve performance as well as reduce network and memory boundedness. However, while it is known that modern HPC systems suffer hardware faults at daily rates, the impact of reduced precision on application reliability is yet to be explored. In this work we aim to fill this gap: first, we propose a qualitative survey to identify the branches of HPC where mixed precision is most popular. Second, we show the results of instruction-level fault injection experiments on a variety of representative HPC workloads, comparing vulnerability to Silent Data Errors (SDEs) under different numerical configurations. Our experiments indicate that use of single and mixed precision leads to comparatively more frequent and more severe SDEs, with concerning implications regarding their use on extreme-scale, fault-prone HPC platforms. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Fault injection; Floating-point unit; Hardware reliability; High-performance computing; Mixed precision","Digital arithmetic; Software testing; Data errors; Fault injection; Floating point units; Hardware reliability; High performance computing systems; High-performance computing; High-performance computing applications; Mixed precision; Performance computing; Single precision; Reliability","Intel Corporation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","Funding text 1: We would like to thank our colleagues from Intel, namely Igor Ermolaev, Christopher Dahnken, Carsten Uphoff and Ben Hoerz, for contributing to our HPC survey.

The Schrödinger equation for the superficial wavefunction leads to an ordinary differential equation with five singularities — four regular and one irregular. We manage to transform this equation into a generalized Heun's equation, with three regular singular points and one irregular singularity at infinity. This equation was studied by Schäfke and Schmidt back in 1980. By means of an external potential, we are able to reproduce the equations of motion of a particle close both to a black hole and a wormhole, thus creating an effective analog model.

In this study, the reduced partition function ratios (RPFRs) of the major Ba-hosting silicate minerals, including muscovite, phlogopite, tremolite, richterite, microcline, albite, and epidote, as well as witherite and barite, are obtained using first-principles calculations. The effect of Ba concentration on the RPFR of those silicate minerals was examined, and no significant effect was observed in the natural range of Ba concentrations. Our results show a heavy Ba isotope enrichment order of tremolite > epidote > albite > witherite ∼ richterite ∼ microcline ∼ barite ∼ muscovite ∼ phlogopite. The RPFRs are controlled by the force constant of Ba and affected by the Ba–O bond length. The lattice environment of substituted ions controls the equilibrium Ba isotope fractionation factors of trace elements. For instance, the replacement of Ba2+ with Mg2+ or K+ in phlogopite introduces an approximately 0.16‰ offset of Ba isotope ratios (138Ba/134Ba) at 1000 K. In general, light Ba isotopes are preferentially enriched in crystalline positions with larger ion radii. Equilibrium Ba isotope fractionation among silicate minerals is up to 0.08‰ at 1000 K, which can be well resolved by the current analytical precision (∼0.05‰ for δ138/134Ba). This study provides the calculated equilibrium fractionation factors, which are the key to understanding Ba isotope fractionation in natural rocks. © 2023","Ba isotopes; Equilibrium fractionation factors; First-principles calculations; Silicate minerals","albite; barium; epidote; igneous rock; isotopic fractionation; microcline; muscovite; phlogopite; richterite; silicate mineral; tremolite","Hefei advanced computing center; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41925017, 42073007, 42273007); University of Science and Technology of China, USTC","Funding text 1: The computations were performed on the supercomputing system in the Supercomputing Center at the University of Science and Technology of China, and Hefei advanced computing center.

However, the fabrication of such a film remains challenging and unreported. Here we show that the annealing of reduced electrochemical graphene oxide (REGO), which has fewer in-plane defects than the conventional graphene oxide from Hummers’ method, leads to a nearly intact graphene lattice (Raman ID/IG down to 0.03) without restoring the graphitic stacking order (I2D/IG > 1 and a single Lorentzian 2D peak). Atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy verifies the unique graphenic structure with random interlayer rotations. Density functional theory calculations imply the low defect density of REGO can suppress the interplanar interaction between undercoordinated carbon atoms, therefore inhibiting cross-plane migration of vacancies and the consequent establishment of stacking order. The annealed, graphenic REGO film is highly flexible and has an in-plane to cross-plane thermal conductivity ratio of 835 (among the highest reported for anisotropic thermal conductors). This high anisotropic ratio is attributed to the inhibited through-plane heat transport (0.26 W m−1 K−1) by the interlayer rotations and the high in-plane thermal conductivity (218 W m−1 K−1) enabled by intact graphene lattice. The graphenic films show high electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of 80.3 dB at a thickness of 53 μm and 42.4 dB at 5.7 μm, with an absolute effectiveness (>70000 dB cm2 g−1) superior to two-dimensional metal carbides (MXenes) and Al foil. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Electrochemical graphene oxide; Electromagnetic interference shielding; Graphenization; Thermal conductivity; Vacancy migration","Anisotropy; Carbides; Density functional theory; Electromagnetic pulse; Electromagnetic shielding; Electromagnetic wave interference; Graphene; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Oxide films; Signal interference; Thermal conductivity; Cross planes; Electrochemical graphene oxide; Electrochemicals; Electromagnetic interference shielding; Graphene lattices; Graphene oxide films; Graphene oxides; Graphenization; Stacking order; Vacancy migration; Carbon films","2-DTech ltd, United Kingdom; High-Performance Computing; Morgan Advanced Materials/Royal Academy of Engineering; Yunnan Fundamental Research Projects, (202301AT070122); University of Manchester, UoM; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52262005); Horizon 2020, (785219, 881603); Yunnan University, YNU","Funding text 1: T.X. acknowledges financial support from 2-DTech ltd, United Kingdom.

Synchronizing the experimental sequence with the phase of power line is widely used to mitigate this problem, but this results in a significant decrease in experimental efficiency. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a simple active compensation method to reduce the observed 50 Hz and 150 Hz strong magnetic interference in an ion trap induced by the power line. In our method, a single 40Ca + ion is used as the magnetic probe and an reverse compensation signal is generated by a programmable arbitrary waveform generator (AWG). After compensation, an 86 % reduction of the periodic magnetic field fluctuation and over 35-fold extension of the coherence time from 70 to 2500 μ s were observed. This method can also be applied to suppress other spectral components of the magnetic field fluctuation related to the power line, and it is also useful for other atomic systems such as neutral atoms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","Magnetic fields; Decoherence; Ion qubits; Ion systems; Lower frequencies; Magnetic field fluctuations; Magnetic interference; Power lines; Power supply; Simple++; Trapped ion; Trapped ions","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11904402, 12004430, 12074433, 12174447, 12174448, 12204543)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 12204543, 11904402, 12074433, 12004430, 12174447, and 12174448).

Although the thermal conductivity of HfB2 has been measured, the experimental results are scattered. Also, the thermal transport mechanism of HfB2 is not well understood. In this work, we study the thermal transport in both pristine and defective HfB2 from first-principles calculations. For the pristine HfB2, the room-temperature thermal conductivities are 175.0 and 157.7 W·m−1·K−1 on a- and c-axes, respectively, where the contributions from electron and phonon are comparable. The Lorenz number is significantly smaller than the Sommerfeld value and shows a temperature dependence, which demonstrates that the Wiedemann–Franz law cannot be used to estimate electronic thermal conductivity. The phonon–isotope and the phonon–electron scattering are non-negligible compared to the phonon–phonon scattering. For the defective HfB2, the grain size effects are negligible with length scales larger than 1 μm. The pore can limit thermal conductivity when its occupancy is larger than 10%. The vacancy is found to induce scattered results in experiments. The phonon thermal conductivity significantly reduces even with only 1% vacancy, while the electronic thermal conductivity is not sensitive to the vacancy. Our study provides an in-depth understanding of the thermal transport in HfB2, and the revealed mechanisms provide important guidance on the design of HfB2-based materials.

In turn, we are able to demonstrate the utility of phase-space techniques in detecting and characterizing first-order, second-order and infinite-order quantum phase transitions, while also enabling an in-depth analysis of the correlations present within critical systems. We also highlight the method's ability to capture other features of spin systems such as ground-state factorization and critical system scaling. Finally, we demonstrate the generalized Wigner function's utility for state verification by determining the state of each system and their constituent sub-systems at points of interest across the quantum phase transitions, enabling interesting features of critical systems to be readily analyzed. © 2023 The Author(s)","Phase space; Phase transition; Quantum many-body system; Quantum spin-lattice; Wigner function","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/N509516/1, EP/T001062/1); Leverhulme Trust, (EM-2020-013)","One of us (RFB) gratefully acknowledges the Leverhulme Trust (United Kingdom) for the award of an Emeritus Fellowship ( EM-2020-013 ).

It also exhibits a maximum energy density of 17 Wh kg−1 with 1267 W kg−1 power density. Further, the MoSe2-based symmetric supercapacitor has been utilized to burn different colors of light-emitting diodes along with a panel of 26 LEDs of red color. To make the working of the symmetric supercapacitor (MoSe2-based) easier to understand for the readers we have proposed a mechanism of charge storage associated with it. Additionally, the experimental finding has been supported by investigating the structural and electronic properties of MoSe2, CoSe2, and NiSe2 via density functional theory calculation. © 2023","and computer simulations; electrochemical reactions; electrode materials; hydrothermal; symmetric supercapacitor","","Computer Center of Central University of Punjab; School of Engineering and Technology; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, CIL; University Grants Commission, UGC, (DEC18-527340); China University of Petroleum, Beijing, CUP; University of Delhi, DU; All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, AIIMS","Funding text 1: One of the authors, Shweta Tanwar acknowledges the University Grants Commission (UGC), India for the award of the Senior Research Fellowship (SRF) (UGC ID- DEC18-527340) fellowship.

Unfortunately, path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations of bosons are computationally prohibitive beyond ∼ 100 particles, due to a cubic scaling with the system size. We present an algorithm that reduces the complexity from cubic to quadratic, allowing the first simulations of thousands of bosons using PIMD. Our method is orders of magnitude faster, with a speedup that scales linearly with the number of particles and the number of imaginary time slices (beads). Simulations that would have otherwise taken decades can now be done in days. In practice, the new algorithm eliminates most of the added computational cost of including bosonic exchange effects, making them almost as accessible as PIMD simulations of distinguishable particles. © 2023 Author(s).","","Molecular dynamics; Quantum theory; Superfluid helium; AS paths; Computational costs; Dynamics simulation; Exchange effects; Orders of magnitude; Path-integral molecular dynamics; Quantum phenomena; Scalings; System size; Time slice; algorithm; article; boson; male; molecular dynamics; simulation; Bosons","United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation, BSF, (2020083); Israel Science Foundation, ISF, (1037/22, 1312/22)","Barak Hirshberg acknowledges support by the USA-Israel Binational Science Foundation (Grant No. 2020083) and the Israel Science Foundation (Grants Nos. 1037/22 and 1312/22).

By its nature, the BMR effect is directly linked to the crystal symmetry of the materials and its spin texture. Therefore, understanding the crystallographic dependency of the effect is crucial. Here we report the observation of crystallographically dependent BMR in thin WTe2 layers and explore how it is linked to its spin textures. The linear response measured in first-harmonic signals and the BMR measured in second-harmonic signals are both studied under a wide range of magnitudes and directions of the magnetic field and applied current and at different temperatures. We discover a threefold symmetry contribution of the BMR when current is applied along the a axis of the WTe2 thin layer at 10 K, which is absent when current is applied along the b axis.  © 2023 American Physical Society.

Small molecular fragments are used as case study to identify two main mechanisms behind the change in binding energy upon spin transitions. The feasibility of the proposed mechanism in porous crystals is assessed by correlating the change in binding energy of CO2, CO, N2, and H2, upon spin crossover, with the adiabatic energy difference associated with the spin state change of the square-planar metal in Hofmann-type clathrates (M = Fe, Mn, Ni). A few promising cases are identified for the adsorption of intermediate ligand field strength molecules such as N2 and H2. The latter stands out as the most original result as the strong interaction in low spin, as expected from a Kubas mechanism, results in a large change in binding energy. This work provides a general perspective towards the engineering of open-metal site frameworks exhibiting local environments designed to have a spin crossover upon adsorption of specific gas molecules. © 2023 Author(s).","","Density functional theory; Molecules; Adiabatic energy difference; Case-studies; Density-functional-theory; Design Principles; Gas release; Hubbard; Molecular fragments; Porous crystals; Spin crossovers; Spin transition; Binding energy","Rhone-Alpes region, (CPER07 13 CIRA); TGCC, (A0110907211, A0130907211); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS; Grand Équipement National De Calcul Intensif, GENCI","Funding text 1: This work benefited from the support of the Emergence@INC program from CNRS and from the Ph.D. program of ILL.

However, as these lattices are infinitely stiff, they do not allow to emulate phonon degrees of freedom. This restriction can be lifted in emerged optical lattices inside multimode cavities. Motivated by recent experimental progress in multimode cavity QED, we propose a scheme to implement and study supersolid and droplet states with phononlike lattice excitations by coupling a Bose gas to many longitudinal modes of a ring cavity. The interplay between contact collisional and tunable-range cavity-mediated interactions leads to a rich phase diagram, which includes elastic supersolid as well as insulating droplet phases exhibiting roton-type mode softening for a continuous range of momenta across the superradiant phase transition. The nontrivial dynamic response of the system to a local density perturbation further proves the existence of phononlike modes.  © 2023 American Physical Society.","","Atom lasers; Crystal lattices; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Drops; Optical materials; Phase diagrams; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Simulation platform; A-RINGS; Bose gas; Cavity QED; Longitudinal modes; Mediated interaction; Multimode cavities; Quantum simulations; Ring cavities; Supersolids; Ultracold atoms; Optical lattices","Tyrolean Science Promotion Fund; Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, ÖAW; Austrian Science Fund, FWF; Tiroler Wissenschaftsförderung, TWF","F. M. acknowledges financial supports from the stand-alone project P 35891-N of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), the Tyrolean Science Promotion Fund (TWF) of the State of Tyrol, and the ESQ Discovery Grant of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW).

Retaining qualitative features of the original Hamiltonian, the optimization reduces quantitative deviations in overall band structures between the ab initio TB model and the full DFT Hamiltonian. The optimization procedure and related details are demonstrated by using semiconducting and metallic Janus transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers in the 2 H configuration. Varying the truncation range from partial second neighbors to third ones, we show differences in electronic structures between the truncated TB model and the original full Hamiltonian, and how much the optimization can remedy the quantitative loss induced by truncation. We further elaborate the optimization process so that local electronic properties such as valence and conduction band edges and Fermi surfaces are precisely reproduced by the optimized TB model. We also extend our discussions to TB models including spin-orbit interactions, so we provide the optimized TB model replicating spin-related properties of the original Hamiltonian such as spin textures.

A. Smolyak Soviet Mathematics Doklady, 4, 240 (1963)]. The main idea is to replace a single large direct product by a sum of selected small direct products. It was first used in quantum dynamics in 2009 by Avila and Carrington [G. Avila and T. Carrington, J. Chem. Phys., 131, 174103 (2009)]. Since then, several calculations have been published by Avila and Carrington and by other groups. In the present study, and to push the limit to larger and more complex systems, this scheme is combined with the use of an on-the-fly calculation of the kinetic energy operator and a Block-Davidson procedure to obtain eigenstates in our home-made Fortran codes, ElVibRot and Tnum-Tana. This was applied to compute the tunneling splitting of malonaldehyde in full dimensionality (21D) using the potential of Mizukami et al. [W. Mizukami, S. Habershon, and D.P. Tew, J. Chem. Phys. 141, 1443–10 (2014)].

This algorithm is applied to investigate the effects of onsite repulsion on the band structure of a square lattice in both the single-site approximations such as dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and multi-site approximations such as effective medium supercell approximation (EMSCA). The advantages of our algorithm in comparison to the Hirsch-Fye algorithm and also the Blankenbecler, Scalapino, and Sugar (BSS) algorithm are the elimination of instabilities resulting from the Metropolis algorithm in the accepting and rejecting configurations, stability at low temperatures, the elimination of systematic errors resulting from the update of the Green's function in the quantum Monte Carlo process, and considering different probabilities for each possible configuration. Finally, by using our algorithm, it is possible to calculate the interacting three-dimensional system's band structure and the density of states that obey the Hubbard model. We have applied our algorithm to an interactive two-dimensional square lattice. As a result, phase transition boundaries can be easily recognized through calculated bands for different repulsions. Our results show that critical Coulomb repulsion values for Mott transition are uc = 9.05t and uc = 2.4t for DMFT and BEMSCA respectively. This means that DMFT significantly overestimates band splitting due to electrons' Coulomb repulsion. We found by starting at low repulsions and then increasing electrons' Coulomb repulsion, a partially flatted valence band around the center of the first Brillouin zone appears, but disappears at high repulsions. © 2023","Band structure; Collumb interaction; Correlated system; Density of state; Hubbard model; Phase transition","Approximation algorithms; Crystal lattices; Hubbard model; Lattice theory; Mean field theory; Systematic errors; Collumb interaction; Correlated systems; Coulomb repulsions; Densities of state; Dynamical mean-field theory; Greens function; Interacting system; Onsite repulsion; Square lattices; Strongly correlated systems; Band structure","","","P.

This approach usually results in an exponential running time. We show that, using ɛ-projectors, we can sample exactly from the limiting distribution. In the black-box setting, where we only have query access to the adjacency matrix of the graph, our sampling algorithm runs in time proportional to Δ-1 , where Δ is the minimum spacing between the distinct eigenvalues of the graph.

This proposed scheme relies on the quantum control and measurements of an auxiliary qubit locally coupled to the quantum fields. By mapping the expectation values of both the real and imaginary parts of the field displacement operator to the qubit states, the qubit’s readout provides complete information regarding the symmetric characteristic function. We characterize our technique by applying it to the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (thermal) and squeezed states of a quantum scalar field. In addition, we have discussed general applications of this approach to analogue-gravity systems, such as Bose-Einstein condensates, within the scope of state-of-the-art experimental capabilities. This proposed strategy may serve as an essential in understanding and optimizing the control of quantum fields for relativistic quantum information applications, particularly in exploring the interplay between gravity and quantum, for example, the relation to locality, causality, and information. © 2023, Science China Press.","analogue gravity; characteristic-function tomography; quantum fields; Ramsey interferometry","Bose-Einstein condensation; Interferometry; Quantum optics; Qubits; Statistical mechanics; Analog gravity; Characteristic-function tomography; Characteristics functions; Direct readout; Novel strategies; Quantum field; Quantum field theory; Quantum state; Ramsey interferometry; Symmetrics; Tomography","Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies, (AHY050000); CAS Key Laboratory for Research in Galaxies and Cosmology; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11905218); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (18010203); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFA0306600)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFA0306600), and Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies (Grant No. AHY050000).

Among the tested catalysts, Mn0.5-Fe2O3/C catalysts achieved a maximum NO conversion of 100 % in a broad temperature range between 225 and 500 °C, significantly higher than monometallic Fe2O3/C. Based on TPR, BET and XPS results, a redox reaction Fe3+ + Mn2+ ↔ Fe2+ + Mn3+ over Fe-O-Mn sites was constructed, which greatly facilitated the adsorption and activation of NO molecules. DFT calculations revealed that the incorporation of Mn obviously increased the local electron density of Fe-Mn sites not only resulting in a strong C-Fe/Mn and N-Fe/Mn bonding, but also effectively weaken the N-O bond. And the NO adsorption energy of Fe-O-Mn site over Mn doped α-Fe2O3 is −0.87 eV which indicates the stability of the adsorption configuration. Combined with the in situ FT-IR results, important intermediates Fe2+-(NO)22– and N2O were identified respectively at 1261 and 1358 cm−1, which were promoted by the synergistic interaction of Mn and Fe.

Density functional theory, which is usually the method of choice, suffers from a distinct disadvantage: The inner potential is calculated as the average of the total electrostatic potential. This includes the highly localized potential generated from the nuclei. The resulting inner potential is far too high, of the order of 3.5 V, and not relevant for electrochemistry. In the density functional based tight binding (DFTB) method the electrostatic potential is much smoother, as it stems from atomic charge fluctuations with respect to neutral reference atoms. The resulting values for the electrochemical inner potential are much lower and compare well with those obtained by other, elaborate methods. Thus DFTB recommends itself as a method for treating the electrochemical interface including the inner potential. © 2023 The Authors.

Various semi-empirical approaches have been used to describe temporal charge carrier dynamics in these materials, but there have yet to be any theoretical approaches utilizing ab initio molecular dynamics. In this work, we develop a computational technique based on ab initio Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics to trace charge carrier temporal motion in archetypical conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). Particularly, we analyze charge dynamics in a single PEDOT chain and in two coupled chains with different degrees of coupling and study the effect of temperature. In our model we first initiate a positively charged polaron (compensated by a negative counterion) at one end of the chain, and subsequently displace the counterion to the other end of the chain and trace polaron dynamics in the system by monitoring bond length alternation in the PEDOT backbone and charge density distribution. We find that at low temperature (T = 1 K) the polaron distortion gradually disappears from its initial location and reappears near the new position of the counterion. At the room temperature (T = 300 K), we find that the distortions induced by polaron, and atomic vibrations are of the same magnitude, which makes tracking the polaron distortion challenging because it is hidden behind the temperature-induced vibrations. The novel approach developed in this work can be used to study polaron mobility along and between the chains, investigate charge transport in highly doped polymers, and explore other flexible polymers, including n-doped ones. © 2023 Author(s).","","Charge carriers; Computational chemistry; Doping (additives); Ions; Molecular dynamics; Polarons; Temperature; Ab initio molecular dynamics; Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation; Charge carrier dynamics; Counterions; Device development; Electronics devices; Ethylenedioxythiophenes; Material development; Semi-empirical approach; Theoretical approach; Conducting polymers","Marie Skłodowska-Curie projects HORATES, (GA-955837); European Commission, EC; National Supercomputer Centre, Linköpings Universitet, NSC","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the European Commission through the Marie Skłodowska-Curie projects HORATES (Grant No. GA-955837).

However, engineering coherent quantum state transfer between magnons and specific information carriers, in particular, mechanical oscillators and solid-state spins, remains challenging due to the intrinsically weak interactions and the frequency mismatch between different components. Here, we show how to strongly couple the magnon modes in a nanomagnet to the quantized mechanical motion (phonons) of a micromechanical cantilever in a hybrid tripartite system. The coherent and enhanced magnon-phonon coupling is engineered by introducing the quantum parametric amplification of the mechanical motion. With experimentally feasible parameters, we show that the mechanical parametric drive can be adjusted to drive the system into the strong-coupling regime and even the ultrastrong-coupling regime. Furthermore, we show the coherent state transfer between the nanomagnet and a nitrogen-vacancy center in the dispersive-coupling regime, with the magnon-spin interaction mediated by the virtually-excited squeezed phonons. The amplified mechanical noise can hardly interrupt the coherent dynamics of the system even for low mechanical quality factors, which removes the requirement of applying additional engineered-reservoir techniques. Our work opens up prospects for developing novel quantum transducers, quantum memories and high-precision measurements. © 2023, Science China Press.","hybrid quantum system; mechanical parametric amplification; strong-coupling regime","Excited states; Nanomagnetics; Oscillistors; Quantum optics; Spin dynamics; Hybrid quantum system; Mechanical; Mechanical motions; Mechanical parametric amplification; Nanomagnets; Of quantum-information; Parametric amplification; Quantum system; Spin interaction; Strong-coupling regime; Phonons","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11774086, 11935006, 1217050862, 12205256, 12247105, 12304407); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2023TQ0310); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2023FRFK06012); Henan Provincial Science and Technology Research Project, (2022112, 232102210175, 232102221001)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 12205256, 12304407, 11935006, 11774086, 12247105, and 1217050862), the Henan Provincial Science and Technology Research Project (Grant Nos. 232102221001, and 232102210175), the HNQSTIT project (Grant No. 2022112), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 2023FRFK06012), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2023TQ0310).","H.

While experimentally many prospective candidates have been proposed and realized, theoretically modeling real materials that display such behavior may pose serious challenges due to the inherently high correlation content of such phases. Over the last few decades, the second-quantum revolution has been the harbinger of a novel computational paradigm capable of initiating a foundational evolution in computational physics. In this report, we strive to use the power of the latter to study a prototypical model, a spin-1/2-unit cell of a Kagome antiferromagnet. Extended lattices of such unit cells are known to possess a magnetically disordered spin-liquid ground state. We employ robust classical numerical techniques such as the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to identify the nature of the ground state through a matrix-product state (MPS) formulation. We subsequently use the gained insight to construct an auxiliary Hamiltonian with reduced measurables and also design an ansatz that is modular and gate-efficient. With robust error-mitigation strategies, we are able to demonstrate that the said ansatz is capable of accurately representing the target ground state even on a real IBMQ backend within 1% accuracy in energy. Since the protocol is linearly scaling O(n) in the number of unit cells, gate requirements, and the number of measurements, it is straightforwardly extendable to larger Kagome lattices that can pave the way for efficient construction of spin-liquid ground states on a quantum device.","","article; mitigation; physics; simulation","","","","","","15205215","","","37795926","English","J Phys Chem A","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175584699"

Based on the metric values of the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE), the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model was found to be the best predictive model for the N-heterocyclic dataset and its respective non-aggregated dataset. When the XGBoost model was applied to three additional pyrimidine-pyrazole hybrid derivatives, this consistency was also seen, and high corrosion inhibition efficiency (CIE) values were obtained ranging from 82.09% to 95.26%. According to the CIE trends found from the ML predictions, DFT calculations for these derivatives also reveal a strong and suitable adsorption energy trend ranging from −1.40 to −1.52 eV. Also supported by the compatibility of the energy gap trend with the CIE trend of the inhibitor molecule. This innovative method can elucidate the characteristics of potential organic corrosion inhibitors before conducting experimental research, which can speed up the preparation of fresh and strong organic corrosion inhibitors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Corrosion inhibitor; Machine learning; N-heterocyclic; Pyrimidine-pyrazole hybrid","","DIKTIRISTEK, (PFR 2023); Universitas Dian Nuswantoro; Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional, BRIN; Institut Teknologi Bandung, ITB","Funding text 1: All calculations were performed using Computation Facility at the Research Center for Materials Informatics, Universitas Dian Nuswantoro, and the High-Performance Computer facility at the Research Center for Nanosciences and Nanotechnology, Bandung Institute of Technology.

In this study, the optoelectronic and thermoelectric properties of novel halide lead-free halide perovskites of the form CsRbPtX6 (X = Cl, Br and I) are investigated for the first time using the Density Functional Theory (DFT). The Quantum Espresso package was used in performing the calculation of the properties of the perovskites. An analysis of their tolerance factors and octahedral factors indicated that the CsRbPtX6 (X = Cl, Br and I) are structurally stable. Likewise, their negative formation energy values imply their chemical stability and since their elastic constants meet the Born-Huang stability criteria, their mechanical stability is also confirmed. In addition to their remarkable stability, the materials are also predicted to have outstanding optoelectronic properties such as low reflectivity and good absorption in the visible region, indicating that they are suitable for photovoltaic applications. The calculated powers conversion efficiencies are ƞ = 7.27%, ƞ = 3.23% and ƞ = 6.3% for CsRbPtCl6, CsRbPtI6 and CsRbPtBr6, respectively. The materials also demonstrate excellent thermoelectric properties including ZT values close to unity and are therefore expected to possess high thermo-power convergence efficiency. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Elastic properties; Halide perovskites; Optoelectronic; Photovoltaic applications; Power conversion efficiency; Thermoelectric","Bromine compounds; Chemical stability; Chlorine compounds; Density functional theory; Elasticity; Lead compounds; Mechanical stability; Perovskite solar cells; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; Elastic properties; First principle calculations; Halide perovskites; Lead-Free; Optoelectronics property; Photovoltaic applications; Power conversion efficiencies; Solar-cell applications; Thermoelectric; Thermoelectric properties; Perovskite","","","A.

In order to achieve the goal of improving the conversion efficiency of solar cells, we design an inorganic germanium-base perovskite solar cells (FTO/Cd0.5Zn0.5S/IDL1/CsGeI3/IDL2/CuI/Au) to enhance the performance of the cells. We have investigated and optimized the overall performance of the solar cell using SCAPS-1D software simulation and combined with DFT calculations. Through the study, we found that CsGeI3 exhibits excellent electronic properties and ionization characteristics, which makes it suitable as an efficient absorber layer. And Cd0.5Zn0.5S and CuI have suitable energy band structures to match CsGeI3. A unique phosphorus bridge is formed on the surface of Cd0.5Zn0.5S, which realizes effective charge separation, and the valence band offset of CuI is low, so this structure is designed by us to further enhance the conversion efficiency of solar cells. We derived the photovoltaic properties of CsGeI3 through DFT calculations and found that there is a strong interaction between Ge2+ and I-, which also provides a theoretical basis for us to use CsGeI3 as an absorber layer. We have further tuned the interfacial defect layer (electron affinity, thickness), Electron transport layer (ETL) and Hole transport layer (HTL) (bandgap, defect density, thickness), absorber layer (bandgap, subjected to the main doping concentration), and operating temperature of the solar cell. It is shown that IDL1 and IDL2 have asymmetry and that IDL1 plays a major role in influencing the performance of solar cells. And too high defect density will make more defects and composite centers inside the ETL, which will reduce the quality of the ETL interface. After the final optimization, we increased the Fill Factor (FF) of the solar cell to 85.77 % and Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) to 25.83 %. Our study provides theoretical support for the development of novel all-inorganic CsGeI3 perovskite solar cells. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","All-inorganic; Germanium-based perovskite cells; Optoelectronic performance; SCAPS","Conversion efficiency; Copper compounds; Defect density; Density functional theory; Electron affinity; Electron transport properties; Electronic properties; Energy gap; Germanium; Germanium compounds; Hole concentration; Hole mobility; Perovskite solar cells; Zinc compounds; Absorber layers; All-inorganic; DFT calculation; Electron transport layers; Germania-based perovskite cell; Germaniums (Ge); Inorganics; Optoelectronic performance; Performance; SCAPS; Perovskite","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52076126); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (22010501500)","This work was partially sponsored by Nation Natural Science Foundation of China (52076126), and Shanghai Science and Technology Committee (22010501500), Key Laboratory of Clean Power Generation and Environmental Protection Technology in Mechanical Industry.

A graphical mapping technique for encoding impulse functions is also proposed. Design/methodology/approach: The Smoluchowski equation, including the Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek potential energy, is solved to simulate colloidal deposition on a planar wall. The performance of different types of entangling layers and over-parameterization is evaluated. Findings: Colloidal transport can be modelled adequately with variational quantum simulations. Full circular entangling layers with real-amplitude ansätze lead to higher-fidelity solutions. In most cases, the proposed graphical mapping technique requires only a single bit-flip with a parametric gate. Over-parameterization is necessary to satisfy certain physical boundary conditions, and higher-order time-stepping reduces norm errors. Practical implications: Variational quantum simulation can solve partial differential equations using near-term quantum devices. The proposed graphical mapping technique could potentially aid quantum simulations for certain applications. Originality/value: This study shows a concrete application of variational quantum simulation methods in solving practically relevant partial differential equations. It also provides insight into the performance of different types of entangling layers and over-parameterization. The proposed graphical mapping technique could be valuable for quantum simulation implementations. The findings contribute to the growing body of research on using variational quantum simulations for solving partial differential equations. © 2023, Fong Yew Leong, Dax Enshan Koh, Wei-Bin Ewe and Jian Feng Kong.","Colloidal transport; DLVO theory; Near-term; Partial differential equations; Variational quantum simulation","Boundary conditions; Mapping; Parameterization; Partial differential equations; Quantum chemistry; Colloidal transport; DLVO theory; Graphical mappings; Mapping techniques; Near-term; Overparameterization; Performance; Quantum simulations; Time evolutions; Variational quantum simulation; Potential energy","Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR, (21709, C210917001)","This work was supported in part by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) of Singapore (#21709) under Grant No. C210917001.

This class is parametrized by a transmission parameter t∈ [0 , 1] . We show that for a certain range for t, the corresponding asymptotic velocity can be made arbitrarily small by introducing a periodic local field with a sufficiently large period. In particular, we prove an upper bound for the velocity of the n-periodic quantum walk that is decaying exponentially in the period length n. Hence, localization-like effects are observed even after a long number of quantum walk steps when n is large. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","","","","H.

Bridgmanite (Brg) and post-perovskite (PPv) are the most abundant minerals in the lowermost mantle. However, their thermal conductivities, as well as the impact of Fe impurities, are highly controversial. In this study, the thermal conductivities of Fe-free and Fe-bearing Brg and PPv at high pressure and temperature were predicted, through a combination of non-equilibrium molecular dynamics and machine learning potential (MLP) trained with data from first-principles calculations. The thermal conductivities of Fe-free Brg and PPv are in agreement with those calculated by the Green-Kubo method based on the MLP. We found that the presence of 12.5 mol% Fe in the lowermost mantle decreases the thermal conductivities of Brg and PPv by ∼10% and ∼14%, respectively. Furthermore, the phase transition from Brg to PPv increases the thermal conductivity of pyrolite by ∼22%. Incorporating the distribution of minerals, temperature, and iron content obtained through the inversion based on mineral elasticity and seismic tomography models, a global heat flow with substantial lateral variation at the core-mantle boundary was reported. The total heat flux from the core was found to be 7.1 ± 0.5 TW, implying a geologically young inner core of 0.75 ± 0.35 Ga. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","age of the inner core; bridgmanite; heat flux from the core; machine learning; post-perovskite; thermal conductivity","Energy transfer; Iron; Iron compounds; Machine learning; Molecular dynamics; Perovskite; Seismology; Thermal conductivity; Age of the inner core; Bridgmanite; Energy-transfer; Heat flux from the core; Learning potential; Lowermost mantle; Machine-learning; Post-perovskite; Thermal history; bridge; heat flux; machine learning; mantle source; perovskite; structural geology; thermal conductivity; Heat flux","Hefei Advanced Computing Center; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41721002, 41925017); University of Science and Technology of China, USTC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (WK2080000144)","Funding text 1: This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41925017, 41721002), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (WK2080000144).

Using the density functional theory implemented in WIEN2K, we conducted a thorough examination of the electronic, structural, optical, and elastic characteristics of A2NaInF6 (A = Cs, Rb) double perovskite materials. The energy formation and the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state fitting curve guarantee both thermodynamic and structural stability. The optimized lattice parameters obtained from our computations are in agreement with the experimental values for the relevant compounds. For calculating the electronic and optical properties of both materials, the widely used TB-mBJ (Trans Blaha modified Becke-Johnson) approximation is utilized. The replacement of ‘Cs’ with ‘Rb’ results in the tuning of the band gap from 7.70 eV to 5.01 eV. After analyzing the mechanical properties, it is anticipated that both materials exhibit elastic stability, brittleness, and relatively lower hardness. The optical properties are computed, analyzed, and presented across a broad energy range of 0-30 eV of incident photon energy. The absorption coefficient, which is a part of the optical properties, highlights the potential of these materials as fundamental components for optoelectronic devices operating in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) region.

Using fully relativistic norm-conserving non-local PBE pseudopotentials and including the spin–orbit (SOC) coupling, the 1T geometries are indirect band gap semiconductors; conversely, the 1OT structures are semimetallic. The band gaps were corrected using the HSE06 hybrid functional, making all structures semiconductors. Maximally localized Wannier functions were utilized to fit the bands of all six structures. The excitonic band structures were obtained using the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE), and the absorption coefficients were estimated at both the BSE and the independent particle approximation (IPA) levels. While the 1OT monolayers are more inclined to absorb light polarized in the y-direction, the 1T structures absorb light equally, independent of the polarization direction. We perceive that the 1T phase is the most promising candidate for photovoltaic devices; in particular, the 1T PdSSe system possesses a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 29.31 % if light trapping techniques are used to enhance absorbance. Amongst the 1OT materials, PdS2 features the highest PCE of 8.38 %. Our results constitute the first step to encourage experimental studies towards the fabrication of Pd-based regular and Janus transition metal dichalcogenides photoabsorbers and give hints of how to increase the PCE of such materials. © 2023","2D materials; Density function theory; Excitons; Transition-metal dichalcogenides","Conversion efficiency; Density functional theory; Energy gap; Light polarization; Monolayers; Palladium compounds; Semiconducting selenium compounds; 2d material; Bethe-Salpeter equation; Density function theory; Dichalcogenides; Excitonic effect; Nonlocal; Power conversion efficiencies; Relativistics; T-phase; Transition-metal dichalcogenides; Transition metals","Lobo Carneiro HPC; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, UFRJ, (135, proj 133)","The authors are grateful for the computational resources provided by Centro Nacional de Processamento de Alto Desempenho in São Paulo-CENAPAD-SP (proj 897 and 909) and the Lobo Carneiro HPC (NACAD) at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) (proj 133 and 135).

The results indicate that the CeRh2As2 superconductor is mechanically and thermodynamically stable in the pressure ranges of 0–40 GPa. For the first time, this analysis provides invaluable, detailed insights into various physical features of this recently reported superconducting material CeRh2As2. It belongs to the well-known CaBe2Ge2-type family. The rising trend of elastic moduli with applied pressure indicates that CeRh2As2 stiffens up under applied pressure. Ductility of the studied superconductor rises significantly with pressure. The study of various anisotropy indices show that the compound is significantly anisotropic under ambient or applied pressure. Various mechanical features of CeRh2As2 are analyzed according to the results of elastic constants and adequately explained. The melting temperature rises with the applied pressure, making CeRh2As2 more suitable for high temperature applications. The electronic properties investigation greatly supports the calculated optical functions. As the applied pressure increases, the absorption and reflectivity spectra shift to higher energy regions. The computed TDOS at 0 GPa pressure at EF is ∼5.07 states/eV/f.u. and applied pressure has a negligible effect on the value of DOS.

However, the pressure required to stabilize H3S is 150 GPa, posing significant challenges for experiments. Therefore, it is essential to find a strategy to reduce this pressure. In this study, by introducing halogen atoms into the H-S system, we discovered that hydrogen-based superconductors of H6SX (X = Cl and Br) can be dynamically stable at mild pressures (5 GPa for H6SCl and H6SBr), as confirmed by first-principles calculations. Through the analysis of the bond properties, we revealed that introducing halogen elements would strengthen the H-S covalent bonds to reduce the dynamically stable pressure of H3S. Our study provides a scheme to reduce the superconducting pressure of hydrogen-based superconductors. © 2023, Science China Press.","electron-phonon coupling; first-principles calculation; hydrides; superconductivity","Bromine compounds; Electron-phonon interactions; High temperature superconductors; Hydrogen; Bond properties; Electron phonon couplings; First principle calculations; Halogen atoms; High-temperature superconductor; Mild pressures; S-systems; Hydrides","Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Development Project, (20210509038RQ); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12122405, 12274169, 52072188); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFA1402304); Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University, (IRT_15R23)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 12122405, 52072188, and 12274169), the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2022YFA1402304), the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (Grant No. IRT_15R23), and the Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Development Project (Grant No. 20210509038RQ).

An atomic and spatial engineering modulating ORR activity over hollow carbon quasi-sphere (HCS) confined in a series of single M-N (M = Cu, Mn, Ni) sites is reported here. Based on the theoretical prediction and experimental validation, Cu-N4 site with the lowest overpotential shows a better ORR kinetics than Mn-N4 and Ni-N4. The ORR activity of single-atom Cu center can be further improved by decreasing the coordination number of N to two, namely Cu-N2, due to the enhancement of electrons with lower coordination structure. Benefitting from the unique spatial confinement effect of the HCS structure in modulating electronic feature of active sites, the Cu-N2 site confined in HCS also delivers highly improved ORR kinetics and activity relative to that on planner graphene. Additionally, the best catalyst holds excellent promise in the application of zinc-air batteries. The findings will pave a new way to atomically and electronically tune active sites with high efficiency for other single-atom catalysts. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","electrocatalysis; M-N-C; oxygen reduction reaction; single atom sites; spatial confinement","Atoms; Carbon; Catalyst activity; Copper compounds; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Kinetics; Manganese compounds; Nickel compounds; Nitrogen; Nitrogen compounds; Oxygen; Reaction kinetics; Zinc; Zinc air batteries; Zinc compounds; Active site; Atomic engineering; M = cu, mn, ni-C; Oxygen reduction reaction; Oxygen reduction reaction kinetics; Reaction activity; Single atom site; Single-atoms; Spatial confinement; Zinc-air battery; Electrocatalysis","Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong, (2022C01033); Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (22202179); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2022M712818); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LQ21B030011)","Funding text 1: H.W. and X.X. contributed equally to this work.

Especially, the diverse crystal structures and exceptional physical properties of multielement van der Waals semiconductors have provided a brand-new platform for the implementation of novel optoelectronic devices. In this study, for the first time, the optoelectronic properties of a newly emerged quaternary van der Waals semiconductor, namely silver indium phosphorus sulfide (AgInP2S6), have been systematically investigated. It is revealed that the AgInP2S6 photodetector exhibits a fast response rate with the response/recovery time down to ≈1/2 ms. In addition, the AgInP2S6 device demonstrates stable photoswitching operation even under a high working temperature of up to 160 °C in the ambient environment without using any specific protection means, and the photoswitching characteristic is also well reserved after a 10-h continuous heating at 150 °C in air. Profiting from the strong immunity to environmental thermal disturbance, a proof-of-concept high-temperature optical communication application is demonstrated. In conclusion, this study provides an intriguing paradigm for the realization of the next-generation optoelectronic devices against extreme working circumstances, which contributes to further broadening the scope of application of 2D material photodetectors in the upcoming future (e.g., space communication and tracking). © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","2D material photodetectors; high-speed photodetectors; high-temperature optical communications; multielement 2D materials; silver indium phosphorus sulfide","Indium compounds; Optical communication; Photodetectors; Photons; Silver compounds; Van der Waals forces; 2d material photodetector; High speed photodetectors; High-temperature optical communication; Highest temperature; Multielement 2d material; Multielements; Optoelectronics devices; Photoswitching; Temperature optical; Van der Waal; Sulfur compounds","One-Hundred Talents Program of Sun Yat-sen University; Project of Improving the Basic Scientific Research Ability of Young and Middle-aged Teachers in Universities of Guangxi Province; Project of Improving the Basic Scientific Research Ability of Young and Middle‐aged Teachers in Universities of Guangxi Province, (2022KY0784); Science and Technology Projects in Guangzhou, (202201011074, 202201011232); State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12104517, 52272175, U2001215); Sun Yat-sen University, SYSU, (22qntd0101); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1515110403, 2022A1515011487); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","Funding text 1: Q.Y. and Z.D. contributed equally to this work.

Their structure are characterized by two conventional 1D NTHs cores, interconnected by covalent bonds arranged in several ways. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the possible atomic structures for double core NTHs, evaluate their relative stability, and calculate some electronic and mechanical properties, using Density Functional Theory calculations and Molecular Dynamics simulations. Many isomers are possible for these 1D materials, differing by the intrinsic structure of the cores and the nature of the covalent bonds crosslinking them. For stilbene and diphenylacetylene NTHs, the most stable isomers feature continuous sp3 or sp2 C-C chains connecting the cores, while those that preserve the original unsaturation of the molecule (azo group) are the most stable for azobenzene. The mechanical behavior of these NTHs are similar to that of conventional single core ones, with enhanced 1D strength and stiffness when continuous chains connect the cores. Their electronic behavior range from metallic to insulating depending on the arrangement of the bonds connecting the cores, and the materials with the narrowest band gaps feature electron delocalization along the chain connecting the cores. The variations in properties associated to the presence of bonds connecting the cores bring new opportunities to the design of electronic and optical devices employing this class of strong and flexible materials. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","1D materials; 1D semiconductors; Carbon nanostructures; Strong materials","Carbon; Chemical bonds; Density (specific gravity); Density functional theory; Energy gap; Isomers; Molecular dynamics; Molecules; Synthesis (chemical); 1D materials; 1d semiconductor; Aromatic molecules; Carbon nano-structures; Core carbons; Diphenylacetylene; Double core; Nanothreads; Shorter chains; Strong material; Azobenzene","Centro Nacional de Supercomputacao; LNCC; National Laboratory for Scientific Computing; PROEX; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação, MCTI; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (311656/2021-8)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing (SDumont supercomputer, LNCC/MCTI, Brazil) and the Centro Nacional de Supercomputacao (CESUP/UFRGS, Brazil) for providing computational resources for the calculations reported in this paper.

Through the plane wave pseudopotential approach, the electronic structure, elastic constant, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young’s modulus, lattice thermal conductivity and phonon relaxation time for Ag2O2S are systematically studied. The results show that the structure is dynamically and mechanically stable, and has a high anisotropic nature. Because of softening phonon and elastic instability, Ag2O2S occurs a phase transition at about 22.8–23.8 GPa. Moreover, the significant acoustic optical coupling in Ag2O2S is observed in the phonon spectra. The predicted lattice thermal conductivity is 3.85 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K, which would have a promising application in the thermal insulation field. The phonon relaxation times in the normal process are smaller that of the umklapp process above 300 K, leading to the decrease of lattice thermal conductivity at high temperature. © 2023, Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science.","Ag<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S; Electronic structure; First-principles; Thermal property","","Higher Education Talent Training Quality and Teaching Reform Project of Sichuan Province, (JG2021-1348); Panzhihua University, (035200171); School Level research project of Panzhihua University, (035001731, 2019YB004); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program, (2018JY0422); Material Corrosion and Protection Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, (2022CL20)","The work was supported by the Opening Project of Material Corrosion and Protection Key Laboratory of Sichuan province (No. 2022CL20), the School Level research project of Panzhihua University (Nos. 035001731 and 2019YB004), the Science and Technology Planning Project of Sichuan Province (No. 2018JY0422), Doctoral Initiation Fund of Panzhihua University (No. 035200171) and Higher Education Talent Training Quality and Teaching Reform Project of Sichuan Province (JG2021-1348).

The realization of the Fredkin gate is definite and has a highly successful probability of being close to the unit, which is feasible with the current technology. Moreover, in contrast to the Fredkin gates that have been proposed, the scheme has the advantages of requiring less quantum resource without auxiliary photons, comparatively simplified circuits, lower requirements on the interaction strength, and robustness against photon loss, thus it can be used for scalable quantum computation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Cross-Kerr nonlinearity; Fredkin gate; Photon system; Quantum computation","Computation theory; Optical Kerr effect; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Cross-Kerr nonlinearities; Fredkin gate; Homodyne detector; Linear optical elements; Minimal cost; Photon system; Quantum information processing; Quantum logic gate; Quantum resources; Resource-efficient; Photons","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61901420)","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Contract 61901420 .","F.-F.

CRYSTALpytools provides functionalities to: i) write and read CRYSTAL input and output files for a range of calculations (single-point, electronic structure, geometry optimization, harmonic and quasi-harmonic lattice dynamics, elastic tensor evaluation, topological analysis of the electron density, electron transport, and others); ii) extract relevant information; iii) create workflows; iv) post-process computed quantities, and v) plot results in a variety of styles for rapid and precise visual analysis. Furthermore, CRYSTALpytools allows the user to translate CRYSTAL objects (the central data structure of the project) to and from the Structure and Atoms objects of the pymatgen and ASE libraries, respectively. These tools can be used to create, manipulate and visualise complicated structures and write them efficiently to CRYSTAL input files. Jupyter Notebooks have also been developed for the less Python savvy users to guide them in the use of CRYSTALpytools through a user-friendly graphical interface with predefined workflows to complete different specific tasks.

It stands out in the condensed matter computational landscape because of the use of local basis sets, heavy parallelisation, efficient implementation of non-local Fock exchange, and extensive use of point and space symmetry. However, it currently lacks an easily programmable interface to access its input/output structure needed to be able to use CRYSTAL calculations within computational materials science workflows. Historically, the use of CRYSTAL in such workflows has been achieved through bespoke scripting implemented in a variety of languages which has hindered code reuse and sharing. Solution method: The CRYSTALpytools project will enable the automation of CRYSTAL calculations in a modular code that can be co-developed by a wide community of users worldwide. It achieves this by transforming standardised input and output files into python objects and providing a suite of functionality to manipulate them. The core implementation is based on a set of data structures denoted the Crystal_objects. CRYSTALpytools, in its current implementation, contains a large variety of functions for input/output manipulation, vibrational and thermodynamic analysis, and visualisation. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The exploitation of point group and space group symmetry is one of the strengths of the CRYSTAL code, therefore, all the geometry modification functions have been developed to optimise the use of symmetry. When a structure is downloaded from a database or is modified by external code, such as pymatgen [3] or ASE [4], a symmetry analysis is performed before transforming the structure to be an optimised Crystal_object. All such objects can be directly transformed to standard structures periodic in 0, 1, 2 or 3 dimensions used by CRYSTAL (ie:.gui or.f34 files).

Computations were based on the Quantum Espresso (PBE) and Gaussian 16/6-31G(d,p) or LanL2DZ basis sets. The formation energy, adsorption energy, and interaction distances between CO and carbon nanotube as a function of the tube diameter were evaluated for Pt- and Pd- doped carbon nanotubes. Such doped nanotubes have relatively higher adsorption energy at smaller diameters, amounting to −2.784 eV and −2.635 eV for Pd-doped and Pt-doped carbon nanotubes, respectively. The adsorption energies of CO gas on Larger tubes Pt and Pd doped carbon nanotube are −2.207 eV, and −2.583 eV eV, respectively. Following CO adsorption, the smaller diameter Pt-doped carbon nanotube has a relatively greater change in electrical conductivity and chemical reactivity than other Pd- or Pt-doped nanotubes with relatively higher diameters. These changes are attributed to energy gaps concerning the alpha and beta HOMO and LUMO molecular orbitals. The computed Raman active mode frequencies extensively depend on diameter pre- and post-adsorption on the Pd- and Pt -nanotubes. This work offers several scientific suggestions concerning the use of Pt and Pd doped carbon nanotubes with different diameters for CO molecule sensor use cases. Such sensor materials having charge movement-based sensing might be employed as acceptors or donors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon nanotube; Diameter; Doping; Electronic structure and vibrational frequency","Adsorption; Carbon nanotubes; Density functional theory; Molecular orbitals; Palladium; Platinum; Platinum compounds; Adsorption energies; CO sensors; Density functional theory studies; Density-functional-theory; Diameter; Doped carbons; Electronic characteristics; Electronic structure and vibrational frequency; Electronic.structure; Zigzag carbon nanotubes; Electronic structure","","","S.A.

In recent years, it has be realized that apart from quantum platforms, classical systems like photonic crystals, phononic crystals, and mechanical oscillators can also be used to simulate quantum models by analogizing the Schrödinger equation. Among these systems, electrical circuits have emerged as a promising simulation platform owing to their low cost, technological maturity, and ease of scalability, successfully simulating numerous important quantum phenomena. Meanwhile, non-Hermitian physics breaks the Hermiticity of systems’ Hamiltonians in traditional quantum mechanics, providing a fresh perspective for understanding the physics of quantum systems, particularly open quantum systems. Non-Hermitian systems, owing to their manifestation of unique phenomena absent in Hermitian systems, have become emerging research subjects in various fields of physics. However, many non-Hermitian phenomena require specialized configurations that pose relatively high technical thresholds on quantum platforms. For instance, the non-Hermitian skin effect typically requires systems to possess non-reciprocal hopping between lattice sites. Therefore, utilizing flexible electrical circuits to simulate non-Hermitian physics becomes a natural choice. This paper provides a short review of the current experimental progress in simulating non-Hermitian lattice models by using electrical circuits. It offers a brief introduction to the relevant knowledge of non-Hermitian physics, including mathematical concepts and novel phenomena, as well as the simulation theory of electrical circuits, including the mapping theory of the lattice models, the introduction of non-Hermiticity, and the measurement of physical quantities. The aim is to provide readers with a reference for better understanding or engagement in related researches, thus promoting further development in this field. © 2023 Chinese Physical Society.","electrical circuit simulation; non-Hermitian physics; non-Hermitian skin effect; non-Hermitian topology; PT symmetry breaking","Circuit simulation; Crystal lattices; Hamiltonians; Oscillistors; Quantum chemistry; Quantum optics; Electrical circuit simulations; Hermitians; Non-hermitian physic; Non-hermitian skin effect; Non-hermitian topology; Pt  symmetries; PT symmetry breaking; Symmetry breakings; Timing circuits","South China Normal University, SCNU; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2019A1515111101)","* Project supported by the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation, China (Grant No. 2019A1515111101) and the Startup Funding from South China Normal University, China. † Corresponding author.

Herein, we investigated strain-modulated electronic and optical properties of Sr3PI3, utilizing first-principles density-functional theory (FP-DFT) in detail. The SOC effect has been included in the computation to provide an accurate estimation of the band structure. At its Г(gamma)-point, the planar Sr3PI3 molecule exhibits a direct bandgap of 1.258 eV (PBE). The application of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) relativistic effect causes the bandgap of Sr3PI3 to decrease to 1.242 eV. Under compressive strain, the bandgap of the structure tends to decrease, whereas, under tensile strain, it tends to increase. Due to its band properties, this material exhibits strong absorption capabilities in the visible area, as evidenced by optical parameters including dielectric function, absorption coefficient, and electron loss function. The increase in compressive or tensile strain also causes a red-shift or blue-shift behavior in the photon energy spectrum of the dielectric function and absorption coefficient. Finally, the photovoltaic (PV) performance of novel Sr3PI3 absorber-based cell structures with SnS2 as an Electron Transport Layer (ETL) was systematically investigated at varying layer thicknesses using the SCAPS-1D simulator. The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 28.15% with JSC of 34.65 mA cm−2, FF of 87.30%, and VOC of 0.92 V was found for the proposed structure. Therefore, the strain-dependent electronic and optical properties of Sr3PI3 studied here would facilitate its future use in the design of photovoltaic cells and optoelectronics. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","electronic properties; first-principles analysis; optical properties; optoelectronic device; spin-orbit coupling effect; strain engineering","Absorption spectroscopy; Blue shift; Computation theory; Conversion efficiency; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Energy gap; Optoelectronic devices; Perovskite; Photoelectrochemical cells; Red Shift; Strontium compounds; Structural properties; Tensile strain; Tin compounds; Absorption coefficients; Dielectric functions; Electronic and optical properties; First principles; First-principle analyse; Inorganics; Optoelectronics devices; Principle analysis; Spin-orbit coupling effects; Strain engineering; Electronic properties","","","M.F.

After the proof of the Lieb-Robinson Theorem in 1972, the past two decades have seen substantial developments in its application to other questions, such as the simulatability of quantum systems on classical or quantum computers, the generation of entanglement, and even the properties of ground states of gapped systems. Moreover, Lieb-Robinson bounds have been extended in non-trivial ways, to demonstrate speed limits in systems with power-law interactions or interacting bosons, and even to prove notions of locality that arise in cartoon models for quantum gravity with all-to-all interactions. We overview the progress which has occurred, highlight the most promising results and techniques, and discuss some central outstanding questions which remain open. To help bring newcomers to the field up to speed, we provide self-contained proofs of the field’s most essential results. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Lieb-Robinson bound; locality; mathematical physics; quantum dynamics; quantum entanglement","","Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-21-1-0195); Alfred P.

However, it is intrinsically difficult to simulate high-energy nuclear physics from the first principle based quantum chromodynamics by using classical computers. In recent years, quantum computing has received intensive attention because it is expected to provide an ultimate solution for simulating high-energy nuclear physics. In this paper, we firstly review recent advances in quantum simulation of high-energy nuclear physics. Then we introduce some standard quantum algorithms, such as state preparation and measurements of light-cone correlation function. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of quantum computing for solving the real-time evolution and the sign problems by studying hadronic scattering amplitude and phase structure of finite-temperature and finite-density matter, respectively. © 2023 Сhinese Physiсаl Sосiety.","high-energy nuclear physics; phase structure of nuclear matter; quantum algorithm; scattering amplitude","Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; First principles; High energy nuclear physics; Nuclear matters; Phase structure of nuclear matter; Quantum algorithms; Quantum chromodynamics; Quantum Computing; Quantum simulations; Scattering amplitudes; State preparation; Phase structure","Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, China, (2020B1212060066); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12005065, 12022512, 12035007); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1515010317, 2023A1515011460)","* Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 12005065, 12022512, 12035007), the Basic and Applied Basic Research Fund of Guangdong Province, China (Grant Nos. 2023A1515011460, 2021A1515010317), and the Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, China (Grant No. 2020B1212060066). † Corresponding author.

Effects of the stacking sequences on the stability, electronic, and transport properties of h-BN are investigated thoroughly based on fully ab initio calculations. We identify three stable h-BN stackings (AA′, AB, and ABC) and present the tight-binding analysis based on Wannier functions as a fresh perspective on the effect of the stacking sequences on interorbital coupling. We also perform ab initio calculations of the electron-phonon interaction and phonon-limited electron mobilities for differently stacked h-BN. Our analysis of electron scattering rates associated with different phonon modes reveals that (i) the room-temperature electron mobilities are limited by acoustic phonons, (ii) for stackings AA′ and AB, the interlayer shear optical phonons also have significant contributions, and (iii) Fröhlich scattering (via longitudinal optical phonons) contributes negligibly to the room-temperature electron mobilities but may play a crucial role at higher temperatures. Semiempirical models, despite their widespread use owing to simplicity, cannot capture these effects precisely when applied to the electron mobility calculation of h-BN. We thus observe a significant discrepancy between our calculated ab initio mobilities and the semiempirical results, which highlights the importance of the accurate fully ab initio determination of the carrier mobilities in h-BN. Our findings can provide a benchmark for exploring the carrier transport properties of van der Waals layered materials.  © 2023 American Physical Society.

The Raman-active CC stretching mode is a sensitive probe of these bonding differences. This mode occurs at the same frequencies as that of isolated polyynes in non-covalent complexes, but it appears at lower wavenumbers in the covalent complexes.

Graphdiyne, a recently emerged interesting 2D semiconductor with its sp-sp2 structure and elastic band gap, is still being explored by researchers in various fields, especially in optoelectronic devices. The van der Waals heterojunctions of graphdiyne with zero-dimensional photosensitizers such as quantum dots could be a great candidate for novel photodetectors. In this work, we constructed a simple and highly sensitive phototransistor by implementing graphdiyne as the charge carrier layer and graphdiyne quantum dots as the photosensitizer layer. The photoresponsivity of the proposed heterostructure was measured to be 4403.6A/W, which is 4.45 times higher than pristine GDY. Compared to pure GDY with an on/off ratio and mobility of (0.131 ± 0.011) ˟ 103 and (1.77 ± 0.085) ˟ 10−2 cm2/V s, respectively., the GDY/GQD heterostructure exhibited an on/off ratio and mobility of (1.5 ± 0.03) ˟ 104, (3.3 ± 0.06) ˟ 10−2 cm2/Vs, respectively. The proposed heterostructure device responded 2.22 times faster to light irradiation and exhibited 12.5 times faster decay time.

First principles density functional theory study reveals the introduction of additional states due to copper doping resulting in the decrease in the band gap making it visible light active. Experimental analysis reveals a change in the morphology from broccoli type assorted spherical particles to cubic shaped structures resulting in three times increase in the surface area as a consequence of doping copper.

Marizomib (MRZ)-loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and manganese dioxide (MnO2) (termed as MRZ-ZIF-8 @MnO2) nanoparticles, a smart-functional therapeutic system, were prepared for the treatment of glioma cancer. Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to assess the structural and morphology properties of drug-loaded ZIF-8-NPs. The findings demonstrated this drug delivery carrier's narrow and particle size distribution. The anticancer drug MRZ released from the NPs was measured. The cell viability of glioma cancer cells (C6 and U87) treated with NPs was established using the cell counting kit-8. The in vitro proliferation of drug-loaded ZIF-8-NPs was substantially increased than that of free MRZ and drug-loaded ZIF-8-NPs treated cells. In addition, The C6 and U87 cell morphological staining studies, such as dual staining (acridine orange/ethidium bromide, AO/EB) and nuclear staining (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, DAPI), ascertain that the drug-loaded ZIF-8-NPs stimulates the apoptosis in glioma cancer cell lines. The results of morphological changes show that a high apoptosis level was found with drug-loaded ZIF-8-NPs. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) validate the apoptotic mode of cancer cell death via the MMP pathway. These findings suggest that the as-fabricated MRZ-ZIF-8 @MnO2-NPs with the synergetic anticancer drug might be applied to treat glioma cancer. © 2023","Apoptosis; Glioma cancer; Marizomib; MnO<sub>2</sub>; ZIF-8","Cancer cells; Cell culture; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Fabrication; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Manganese oxide; Mitochondria; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Targeted drug delivery; Transmission electron microscopy; Tumors; Anticancer drug; Cancer cells; Clinical trial; Drug-delivery systems; Glioblastomas; Glioma cancers; Marizomib; Mitochondrial membrane potential; Proteasome inhibitors; Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8; Cell death","King Saud University, KSU; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, (2019SF-068, RSPD2023R677)","This work was supported by Shaanxi Natural Science Foundation (Funding number: 2019SF-068 ).

As far as, the reviews published on CNOs have paid attention to the synthesis, characterization, surface functionalization and biomedical applications. However, very few works have summarized the advances and challenges of CNOs for application in SCDs. In this review, our objective is to summarize the recent advancement and challenges of the synthetic strategy, morphology, and electrochemical performance of different CNOs based materials along with their application in SCDs. The review commence with a short description of CNOs history and its structure, followed by the CNOs based supercapacitors and its recent advancement for the capacitance value augmentation. Then emphasized the synthetic procedure of Doped CNOs and its applications. After a critical analysis of the literature, we have discussed the molecular mechanism behind the improved electrochemical behavior of doped CNOs as compared with the pristine CNOs. A common guidance for selecting dopants based on their specific applications in supercapacitors have been explored. Further, the physico-chemical and electrochemical properties of CNO-composites are also discussed. We summarized the DFT based studies for CNOs based materials, and the advantages of Molecular Modeling/ReaxFF based simulation techniques for modeling of CNOs based electrodes and task specific electrolyte design for SCDs. The CNOs based materials are very good candidates for supercapacitor electrode design, with various challenges, more specifically the structural ordering of CNOs, electrochemical performance and condition of supercapacitor health. The Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) based literatures are discussed and recommended several AI/ML based algorithms in the field of supercapacitors and energy storage devices (ESDs) to predict the specific capacitance value and the supercapacitors condition of health. We have outlined the current challenges and opportunities in this field. To the best of our knowledge, the review will be useful to provide a systematic framework for CNOs based research in the field of supercapacitor devices. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","ab-initio/DFT, ReaxFF; Artificial intelligence / Machine learning; Carbon nano onions; Fullerene; Porous carbon and CNO- composites; Supercapacitor","Artificial intelligence; Capacitance; Design for testability; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytes; Medical applications; Morphology; Porous materials; Ab initio; Ab-initio/DFT, reaxff; Artificial intelligence / machine learning; Capacitance values; Carbon nano-onions; Electrochemical performance; Machine-learning; Porous carbon and carbon nano onion- composite; Porous carbons; Supercapacitor","Central University of Punjab Bathinda; University of Central Punjab, UCP; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST, (SB/FT/CS-158/2013); University Grants Commission, UGC, (F.30-432/2018(BSR))","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by generous grants from the University Grants Commission (UGC)-BSR Start-up grant (F.30-432/2018(BSR)), Central University of Punjab - Research Seed Money, Department of Science and Technology (DST) under Fast Track Scheme for Young Scientist (SB/FT/CS-158/2013), Government of India.

However, for the accurate interpretation of the corresponding multi-dimensional spectra, there is a need for precise quantum dynamical simulations based on model Hamiltonians. In this article, we present the initial release of our code, QuDPy (Quantum Dynamics in Python), which provides a robust numerical platform for performing quantum dynamics simulations based on model systems, including open quantum systems. A distinguishing feature of our approach is the ability to specify various high-order optical response pathways in the form of double-sided Feynman diagrams through a straightforward input syntax. This syntax outlines the time-ordering of ket-sided or bra-sided optical interactions acting on the time-evolving density matrix of the system. We utilize the quantum dynamics capabilities of QuTip to simulate the spectral response of complex systems, allowing us to compute virtually any n-th order optical response of the model system. To illustrate the utility of our approach, we provide a series of example calculations.

Be-p orbitals dominate the electronic structure near the Fermi level, with two-band and three-band Fermi surfaces for α- and β-beryllene, respectively. α-beryllene hosts intrinsic type-I Dirac Fermions with the existence of nontrivial edge states and topological Z2 index, while β-beryllene has both type-I and type-II Dirac cones around the Fermi level and is topologically trivial. Migdal-Eliashberg theory combined with electron-phonon calculations predicts that both α- and β-beryllene are single-gap superconductors with critical temperature Tc = 9.9 K and 12.6 K, respectively. The difference is ascribed to the structure. Specifically, β-beryllene can be viewed as a bilayer of α-beryllene with a resulting increased density of states and enhanced electron-phonon coupling. And additionally, the Fermi surface of β-beryllene is strongly nested leading to Kohn anomalies that enhance the electron-phonon coupling λ. Replacing Be with heavier group-II atoms (Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) leads to strongly suppressed Tc due to electronic structure changes and the ensuing lower λ as well as lower phonon frequencies that reduce the prefactor. Our findings suggest beryllenes are promising two-dimensional elemental platforms for studying superconductivity and Dirac band topology. © 2023","Beryllene; Dirac cones; Electron-phonon interaction; First-principles calculations; Superconductivity","Electron correlations; Electronic structure; Electrons; Fermi level; Fermi surface; Superconducting materials; Topology; Ambient pressures; Beryllene; Dirac cones; Dirac fermions; Electron phonon couplings; Electronic.structure; First principle calculations; Orbitals; Two bands; Two-dimensional superconductors; Electron-phonon interactions","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12074381, 12104458, 12204482, 12304095); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1515110587, 2022A1515110404, 2022A1515140030)","The authors acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 12104458 , 12074381 , 12304095 , and 12204482 ) and Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (Grant Nos. 2022A1515140030 , 2022A1515110404 , and 2021A1515110587 ).

This phenomenon, known as the ""arctic circle,""has been studied theoretically in combinatorial mathematics and statistical mechanics. Here, we realize the physics of the arctic circle experimentally for the first time, using a programmable lattice of superconducting qubits, and investigate its properties under the prism of a highly frustrated magnet. Our work reveals two unexpected properties. First, the disordered spin manifold confined within the arctic curve is a spin liquid whose average spin texture resembles that of an antivortex, i.e., it is a topologically charged Coulomb phase. Second, monopole quasiparticle excitations, which are totally absent in theoretical works, can be isolated in a phase-separated system. Remarkably, a monopole segregation mechanism is observed, in which the monopoles are sorted according to the magnetic charge and magnetic moment they carry, without the application of an external driving force. © 2023 American Physical Society.

In recent years, the theoretical and experimental studies of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians realized in quantum systems have attracted wide attention. Here, the parameter estimation based on eigenstates of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is investigated, and the corresponding quantum Fisher information and quantum Cramér-Rao bound for the single-parameter and two-parameter estimations are given. In particular, the quantum Fisher information about estimating intrinsic momentum and external parameters in the non-reciprocal and gain-and-loss Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models, and non-Hermitian versions of the quantum Ising chain, Chern-insulator model and two-level system are calculated and analyzed. For these non-Hermitian models, the results show that in the case of single-parameter estimation in these non-Hermitian models, the quantum Fisher information increases significantly in the gapless regime and near the exceptional points, which can improve the accuracy limit of parameter estimation. For the two-parameter estimation, the determinant of the quantum Fisher information matrix also increases obviously near the gapless and exceptional points. In addition, a higher overall accuracy can be achieved in the topological regime than in the trivial regime, and the topological bound in two-parameter estimation can be determined by the Chern number. © 2023 Chinese Physical Society.","non-Hermitian systems; parameter estimation; quantum Fisher information; topological states","Fisher information matrix; Hamiltonians; Quantum optics; Topology; Exceptional points; Fisher information; Hermitians; Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians; Non-hermitian system; Parameters estimation; Quantum fisher information; Single parameter; Topological state; Two parameter; Parameter estimation","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12174126); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1515010315)","* Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 12174126) and the Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (Grant No. 2021A1515010315). † Corresponding author.

This question is valid not only in Hermitian system but also in non-Hermitian system. So far, most attempts are limited to Hermitian systems, while the possible non-Hermitian solution remains outstanding. In this work, we generalize the quantum covariance matrix method to the cases that are applicable to non-Hermitian systems, through which we are able to explicitly reconstruct the non-Hermitian parent Hamiltonian from an arbitrary pair of biorthogonal eigenstates. As concrete examples, we successfully apply our approach in spin chain with Lee-Yang singularity and a non-Hermitian interacting fermion model. Some generalization and further application of our approach are also discussed. Our work provides a systematical and efficient way to construct non-Hermitian Hamiltonian from a single pair of biorthogonal eigenstates and shed light on future exploration on non-Hermitian physics.  © 2023 American Physical Society.

Here, classic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to investigate the coil morphology and the uniaxial tensile characteristics of thirteen CCNTs that were constructed by twisting carbon nanotube (CNT) segments of toroid formed by six identical CNT segments, with intricate effects of coil spacing and twist-induced spiraling pathway. The MD results showed that the coil morphology and stretching properties of CCNTs are greatly dictated by pitch length and spiraling pathway. All CCNTs showed unique characteristics of sawtooth-like patterns in the tensile stress-strain curves, originating from the separation of van der Waals (vdW) attracted coils, strain-induced buckling of CNT segments and nanohinge-like plastic deformations. Depending on the non-uniform pitch length and spiraling pathway of twisted CCNT segments, CCNTs exhibit different mechanical properties including Young's modulus, elastic limit, tensile strength, fracture strain, stiffness coefficient and distinguishing deformation mechanisms. Particularly, the fracture strain and tensile strength are significantly dictated by the pitch length and spiraling pathway, respectively. The elastic proprieties of finite element (FE) models scaled to CCNTs were established for comparison with the case of CCNTs with symmetrical spiraling. Moreover, CCNTs show high toughness that can be controlled by the pitch length and spiraling pathway. This study provides new insights and perspectives into the mechanical properties of nanocoils, which is of help to designing optimal nanocoils for nano-device systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Coiled carbon nanotubes; Molecular dynamic simulation; Pitch length; Spiraling pathway; Toughness","Ductile fracture; Elastic moduli; Molecular dynamics; Morphology; Stiffness; Strain; Stress-strain curves; Tensile strength; Van der Waals forces; Coiled carbon nanotube; Diverse applications; Dynamics simulation; Fracture strain; Molecular dynamic simulation; Nanocoils; Nanoelectromechanical devices; Non-uniform; Pitch length; Spiraling pathway; Carbon nanotubes","Jiangxi Provincial Outstanding Young Talents Program, (20192BCBL23029); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11772278, 11904300, 12172314); Norges Forskningsråd, (262644); Xiamen University, XMU, (20720210025); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project, (B16029)","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 12172314 , 11772278 , and 11904300 ), the Jiangxi Provincial Outstanding Young Talents Program (Grant No. 20192BCBL23029), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Xiamen University: Grant No. 20720210025 ), the Research Council of Norway (Grant No. 262644 ), and the 111 project ( B16029 ).

Our tests do not focus on the topology of quantum computers or the specific implementation details of preparing quantum bits. Instead, we examine the overall performance of quantum computers from the perspective of users. Inspired by traditional computer benchmark tests such as SPECCPU2017, we integrate existing scalable quantum applications and algorithms to generate a testing set that covers algorithms such as search, machine learning, factorization, portfolio optimization, and entanglement state preparation, effectively simulating real workloads. By running the testing set, we can understand the performance of current quantum computers and generate a comprehensive score by combining our evaluation system, which consists of sub-scores of various backend features, including quantum gate error rate, entanglement between quantum bits, cross talk, and connectivity. These sub-scores are calculated based on the program features of the testing cases combined with their running results, where the program features are analyzed through the logical circuits of the testing cases. We incorporate Hellinger fidelity and polarization rescaling into each benchmark to calculate the fidelity of the running results.

The dependence of the relative stability of SiC polytypes and stacking fault energies on excess carrier concentration was investigated using first-principles calculations. The relative energy of 2H-, 4H-, and 6H-SiC to 3C-SiC increased with the excess electrons over 2 × 1019 cm−3, while the energy variation with excess holes was small. The stacking fault energies in 4H-SiC also exhibited a significant decrease with excess electrons over 1.0 × 1019 cm−3, whereas this change was minor with excess holes. These excess carrier dependencies were attributed to variations in the bandgap between polytypes. The energy level of the excess electrons was at the conduction band minimum; this was lowest in 3C-SiC, which had the lowest bandgap energy. Consequently, the energy of 3C-SiC with excess electrons was lower than that of other polytypes. Conversely, the valence band maximum lacked electrons when excess holes were present, resulting in a small difference among the Fermi levels of the polytypes. Hence, the energy difference between the SiC polytypes was similar for excess holes. Similarly, the stacking faults in SiC exhibited quantum-well structures by incorporating other polytypes with different bandgaps. With excess electrons, the Fermi level within the stacking faults was lower than that in the bulk crystals. Consequently, the stacking fault energy decreased for the same reason that the energy in 3C-SiC decreased under excess electron conditions. © 2023 Author(s).","","Carrier concentration; Electrons; Energy gap; Fermi level; Semiconductor quantum wells; Silicon; Stacking faults; Bipolar degradations; Energy; Excess carriers; Excess electrons; Fault energy; First-principles investigations; Low stacking fault energies; Polytype stability; Polytypes; SiC polytypes; Silicon carbide","","","H.

By considering a single spatial dimension, we determine the conditions under which the model with impurity can be seen as an effective model for the Maxwell-scalar system, having similar solutions. This correspondence shows that the impurity can be used to describe the presence of a charge density, and we use it to verify that the impurity-free case, which supports minimum energy configurations, is related to the case of point charges. We also investigate a class of impurities which modifies the core of the scalar field, and find the corresponding nontrivial charge densities and electric fields.

ZIF thin films have been intensively pursued, motivated by the desire to prepare membranes for selective gas and liquid separations. To achieve membranes with high throughput, as in ångström-scale biological channels with nanometre-scale path lengths, ZIF films with the minimum possible thickness—down to just one unit cell—are highly desired. However, the state-of-the-art methods yield membranes where ZIF films have thickness exceeding 50 nm. Here we report a crystallization method from ultradilute precursor mixtures, which exploits registry with the underlying crystalline substrate, yielding (within minutes) crystalline ZIF films with thickness down to that of a single structural building unit (2 nm). The film crystallized on graphene has a rigid aperture made of a six-membered zinc imidazolate coordination ring, enabling high-permselective H2 separation performance. The method reported here will probably accelerate the development of two-dimensional metal–organic framework films for efficient membrane separation. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Gas permeable membranes; Thin films; Amorphous networks; Crystalline networks; Divalents; Imidazolate; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Thin-films; Transition-metal centers; Unit cells; Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks; Zn 2+; Transition metals","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Basic Energy Sciences, BES; Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences Division, CSGB, (DE-SC0021212); European Research Council, ERC, (805437-UltimateMembranes); European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, ESRF; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (514601, PYAPP2_173645); Soochow University, (NH10902123)","Funding text 1: We acknowledge D.

XRD results indicate the formation of nanosized particles with high phase dispersion, however, Raman, Mössbauer, 27Al NMR and XPS spectroscopies suggest the presence of iron(iii) oxide, Al2O3 and CuO phases. The FTIR with pyridine adsorption revealed high Lewis acidity. The TPR profile showed the reduction temperature range for the Fe3+ and Cu2+ sites, indicating the suitable condition for pretreatment. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms indicated the presence of micro-mesopores with interesting textural properties and specific area varying between 71 and 220 m2 g−1, while the porous morphology was observed by SEM and TEM images. The optimized catalytic tests showed glycerol conversion of 60% and acetol selectivity of 92% with 17% of coke according to TG profile. The recycling tests confirmed the efficiency of the solid, reaching 28% conversion and 91% acetol selectivity after four reuses and, after reactivation in an oxidizing atmosphere, the catalytic performance obtained results close to the second reuse. The interaction between the different Lewis acid sites involved in the mechanisms for the acetol and coke formation on the catalyst surface is discussed. The charge distribution represented by colors which indicates the acid-base surface was evaluated by a simple theoretical-computational study based on the DFT approach. The synergy between the active sites indicates that the presence of Cu0/Cu+ drastically increases the acetol selectivity which is a more important characteristic than the high Lewis acidity of Fen+ and Al3+ © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Copper oxides; Dehydration; Glycerol; Hematite; Morphology; Active site; Catalytic dehydration; Cu-based; Fe-based; Glycerol conversions; Lewis acidity; Nanosized particle; Phase-dispersion; Reuse; XRD; Coke","NPAD; Center for High Performance Computing, CHPC; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (312854/2021-8); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (PID2021-126235OB-C32); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Université de Poitiers, UP","The authors would like to thank the Brazilian CNPq and CAPES funding agencies for financial support.

Results showed a relation between the methanol selectivity, iron content and mesopore addition on Fe-MOR as well as H2O concentration in the feed. Decreasing the iron content of Fe-MOR, adding mesopores to MOR or increasing water vapor pressure from 3 to 21 kPa gave higher methanol selectivity. Addition of mesopores suppressed the over-oxidation products (CO and CO2) and coke formation significantly, resulting in an increased catalyst lifetime as well as higher methanol turnover frequency (2.0 vs. 3.9 h−1 at 320 °C). Using DFT methods several active site candidates were analyzed regarding their formation energies, UV–Vis spectra and methanol formation pathways.

Our findings demonstrate the dynamical, mechanical and thermal stability of 2D α-CM. In particular, for the 2D α-CP adsorbed with Li atom, binding energy (EB) of −2.00 eV ensures favourable adsorption. In contrast to 2D α-CP, the EB of adsorbed Li atom over α-CN is lower than the cohesive energy of lithium metal, this eliminates the accessibility of 2D α-CN as an anode in LIBs. The Li atom adsorption changes the nature of the 2D α-CP from semiconducting to metallic, ensuring high electronic conductivity. Both partial density of states and Lo¨wdin charge analysis indicate substantial charge transfer from Li atom to 2D α-CP after adsorption. The multilayer adsorption on both sides of 2D α-CP yields Li5.0CP monolayer with remarkably high specific storage capacity (1108.91 mAhg−1). The obtained average open circuit voltage is suitable for extensive battery application. Diffusion barrier of 0.11 eV shows ultrahigh ionic mobility over the 2D α-CP and thus facilitates charging/discharging process. As a result, high specific storage capacity, lower diffusion barrier, negligible volume change and excellent electronic conductivity imply the promising utility of 2D α-CP as anodic material in LIBs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2D α-CN and α-CP; Density functional theory; Diffusion energy barrier; Li-ion batteries; Specific storage capacity","Adsorption; Anodes; Atoms; Binding energy; Charge transfer; Diffusion barriers; Electric conductivity; Ions; Lithium-ion batteries; Monolayers; Storage (materials); Thermodynamic stability; 2d α-CN and α-CP; Anode material; Density functional theory studies; Density-functional theory calculations; Density-functional-theory; Diffusion energy barriers; Electronic conductivity; Li atoms; Specific storage capacity; Storage capacity; Density functional theory","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST, (562, 597, DST/INSPIRE Fellowship/2018/IF180724, SR/FST/PS-Ι/2022/230); Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB, (CRG/2019/001292)","DC highly appreciates the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India, for the Inspire Fellowship award (No. DST/INSPIRE Fellowship/2018/IF180724 ).

Half-Heusler compounds exhibit significant promise as thermoelectric materials suitable for high temperatures, thereby offering a potential solution to address the energy crisis. By employing density functional theory (DFT), semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory (BTE), and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), this study thoroughly examines the structural, electronic, magnetic, phonon, mechanical, and thermoelectric properties of 18 valence electron half Heusler compound NbIrSn. Considering the presence of heavy 5d transition element Ir in our compound, all calculations are carried out with and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This material display both dynamic and mechanical stability, and also possess the property of ductility as indicated by Pugh’s ratio and Poisson’s ratio. NbIrSn is identified as non-magnetic semiconductors with indirect band gaps of 0.65 eV and it reduces to 0.63 eV when SOC is included. The different transport parameters are analyzed in relation to the chemical potential and doping concentrations for different temperatures. The lattice thermal conductivity of the material at room temperature is measured to be 13.40 Wm−1K−1 and 14.81 Wm−1K−1without and with SOC respectively. The optimal zT values for NbIrSn at 1200 K are 0.98 with p-type doping and 0.31 with n-type doping. Incorporating SOC leads to a substantial improvement, raising the optimal zT values to 1.33 for p-type doping and 0.47 for n-type doping. In conclusion, incorporating SOC is essential when analyzing the characteristics of the proposed compound.

However, the poor electron transfer of spinel oxide electrode materials weakens the intensity of surface redox reactions, thereby hindering the further improvement of energy density of the supercapacitors. In this study, flower-like heterogeneous La2CoMnO6 @NiCo2O4 materials were in-situ grown on a nickel foam (LCMO@NCO/Ni) via interface engineering and morphological engineering for the first time. The as-constructed heterogeneous materials benefit from the high electron conductivity of LCMO for the rapid transfer of electrons in NiCo2O4 (NCO), resulting in increased surface redox reaction rates. Interestingly, these successfully constructed heterogeneous LCMO and NCO structures act as electron donor and acceptor, respectively. Such a system promotes the increase in the electron cloud density around NCO, leading to an enhanced intensity of the redox reactions. The unique nanoflower-like structure and strong interfacial interaction of the developed heterogeneous LCMO@NCO/Ni material result in an electrode material with excellent supercapacitor performance with a high specific capacitance of 598 F·g−1 at a current density of 1 A·g−1. The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with activated carbon and as-prepared material possesses a high energy density of 39.9 Wh·kg−1 at 1600 W·kg−1, proving suitable for practical applications. Overall, the proposed synthesis strategy is promising for the fabrication of novel heterogeneous electrode materials for supercapacitors with improved energy density. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Double perovskite; Heterojunction; La<sub>2</sub>CoMnO<sub>6</sub> @NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>; Spinel oxide; Supercapacitor","Activated carbon; Cobalt compounds; Electrodes; Electrons; Lanthanum compounds; Manganese compounds; Nickel compounds; Perovskite; Reaction rates; Redox reactions; Supercapacitor; Surface reactions; Double perovskite oxide; Double perovskites; Electrode material; Electron conductivity; Energy density; La2CoMnO6 @nico2O4; Performance; Redox kinetics; Spinel oxide; Supercapacitor application; Heterojunctions","Excellent Team Project for Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship of the Jilin Province, (20210509051RQ)","The authors greatly acknowledge the financial support from the Excellent Team Project for Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship of the Jilin Province (Grant No. 20210509051RQ ).

The resulting catalyst exhibited remarkable plasmonic photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation. In comparison with benchmark rutile TiO2 and g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure catalysts, the first-order reaction rate constant of the developed catalyst improved approximately 34.2 and 6.5 times, respectively. The doping concentration of carbon and the crystal size of TiN nanoparticles, predominantly influenced by the amount of urea and calcination temperature, were identified as crucial factors governing the plasmonic photocatalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the introduction of carbon-sp bands into the TiN band structure promoted interband excitation of electrons and facilitated the generation of hotter holes, thereby enhancing the degradation of dyes and ultimately contributing to the superior photocatalytic activity observed. © 2023 The Authors","C doped TiN; Dye degradation; Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR); Ultrathin carbon layers","Carbon; Light; Nanoparticles; Titanium; Calcination; Catalysts; Density functional theory; Doping (additives); Gold; Oxide minerals; Photocatalytic activity; Plasmonics; Rate constants; Surface plasmon resonance; TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium dioxide; Urea; carbon; nanocrystal; tin; titanium dioxide; urea; nanoparticle; titanium; C doped TiN; C-doped; Carbon layers; Dye degradation; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Plasmonics; Ultra-thin; Ultrathin carbon layer; ]+ catalyst; activated carbon; catalysis; catalyst; dye; nanoparticle; performance assessment; photodegradation; reaction rate; Article; calcination temperature; catalyst; chemical composition; chemical reaction; chemical structure; crystal; crystal structure; cubic crystal; deconvolution; degradation; density functional theory; doping; electron; excitation; irradiation; light; light absorption; morphology; oxidation; photocatalysis; photodegradation; pore size distribution; rate constant; reaction time; stoichiometry; surface plasmon resonance; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; chemistry; Carbon","UK research council EPSRC, (EP/V041665/1, EP/W027593/1)","The authors thank the financial supports from the UK research council EPSRC ( EP/W027593/1 , EP/V041665/1 ).

However, their coexistence in hot alkali-metal borides has not been observed. In this work, we apply first-principles structure search calculations to identify eight Na-B compounds with host-guest structures, which exhibit a wide range of building blocks and interesting properties linked to the Na/B composition. Among the known borides, Na-rich Na9B stands out as the composition with the highest alkali-metal content, featuring vertex- and face-sharing BNa16 polyhedra. Notably, it exhibits electride characteristics and transforms into a superionic electride at 200 GPa and 2000 K, displaying unusual Na atomic diffusion behavior attributed to the modulation of the interstitial anion electrons. It demonstrates semiconductor behavior in the solid state, and metallic properties associated with Na 3p/3s states in the superionic and liquid regions. On the other hand, B-rich NaB7, consisting of a unique covalent B framework, is predicted to exhibit low-frequency phonon-mediated superconductivity with a Tc of 16.8 K at 55 GPa.

Ten compounds were discovered, among which YHfH12, YThH12, ScZrH12, and LaThH12 show good superconductivity with critical temperatures above 150 K. LaThH12 and YCeH12 can be dynamically stable at a minimum of 100 GPa. Aiming at a comprehensive description of the H24 cage that dominates the superconductivities of MXH12, we proposed a variable AE, which is defined as the average ELF value at the center of all the H–H bonds in the cage-like hydrides. Combining the AE with the contribution of the H element to the total DOS at the Fermi level, we constructed a simple liner model (called the AE model) by fitting the data of hydrides MXH12. The mean absolute error is 11.7 K suggesting a strong linear correlation between AE and Tc. Furthermore, the AE model can be generalized to predict the superconductivity of other cage-like hydrides such as LaH10 (or YH10) with H32 cage, YH9 (or CeH9) with H29 cage, and more complex cage-like hydrides such as La4H23 and LaBeH8. The AE model could estimate the Tc of clathrate hydrides with small computational cost and provide reliable reference for further high-throughput calculations and experimental research. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","AE model; High pressure; High-throughput calculation; Hydrides; Sodalite-like structure; Superconductivity","Calcium compounds; Cerium compounds; Hydrates; Lanthanum compounds; Zirconium compounds; AE model; Cage likes; Clathrates; Critical temperatures; High pressure; High T c; High-throughput; High-throughput calculation; Sodalite-like structure; Ternary hydrides; Hydrides","Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Development Project, (20210509038RQ); Program for Science and Technology Innovation Team in Zhejiang, (2021R01004); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12122405, 12274169, 52072188); Jilin University, JLU; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFA1402304); National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin, NSCC-TJ","Funding text 1: This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 12274169 , 12122405 and 52072188 ), National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2022YFA1402304 ), Program for Science and Technology Innovation Team in Zhejiang (Grant No. 2021R01004 ), and Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Development Project ( 20210509038RQ ).
