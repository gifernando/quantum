In existing NV-based quantum sensing systems, microwave source and delivery units are implemented by a set of bulky and costly instruments. This limits its practical applications as well as portability. Here, a VCO integrated with the filtering antenna is designed, providing a more uniform, efficient, broadband and lower phase noise microwave field coupling to the NV centers. As a result, the sensitivity and the dynamic range have been improved over the conventional scheme using separate microwave components, such as antennas, transmission lines, and resonators. Moreover, in this work, the optic filter, and photodetector are also integrated using the hybrid microwave integrated circuits (HMIC) technique for the first time. This significantly increases the integration level and reduces the cost of the NV-based magnetometers. The experimental results indicate that our VCO integrated filtering antenna achieves a sensitivity of 8.52 &#x03BC;T/Hz1/2 and a dynamic range up to 32.73 dB, which are both greatly improved compared to the VCO with a single resonator. This validates the effectiveness of the approach.

The converter, which weighs less than 75 g and has a volume of only 100 cm3, is built around an ultra-low power OP-90 precision operational amplifier, which consumes less than 0.5 mA at 9 V when converting the output of a Li-Cor LI-190SA quantum sensor exposed to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 2500 μmol m-2 s-1 or only 5 μA in low light. A small 9-V battery thus powers the amplifier for more than 1000 h of continuous operation. Correlations between photometer readings and voltage output from the current-to-voltage converter were high and linear at both high and low PAR. Sixteen Li-Cor LI-190SA quantum sensors each equipped with current-to-voltage converters and connected to a miniature data logger were deployed in the upper branches of a Panamanian tropical rainforest canopy. Each unit performed reliably during a one- or two-week evaluation.","Canopy; Current-to-voltage converter; Data acquisition; Miniature data logger; Photosynthetic quantum sensor; Photosynthetically active radiation","","","","","","","","Fiore J.M., Operational Amplifiers and Linear Integrated Circuits: Theory and Application, (1992); Parker G.G., Smith A.P., Hogan K.P., Access to the upper forest canopy with a large tower crane, Bioscience, 42, pp. 664-670, (1992); Pearcy R.W., Radiation and light measurements, Plant Physiological Ecology, pp. 97-116, (1989); Pontailler J.Y., A cheap quantum sensor using a gallium arsenide photodiode, Funct.

We report our latest results on a range of AlGaInN diode-lasers targeted to meet the linewidth, wavelength and power requirements suitable for quantum sensors such as optical clocks and cold-atom interferometry systems. This includes the [5s2S1/2-5p2P1/2] cooling transition in strontium+ion optical clocks at 422 nm, the [5s21S0-5p1P1] cooling transition in neutral strontium clocks at 461 nm and the [5s2s1/2 - 6p2P3/2] transition in rubidium at 420 nm. Several approaches are taken to achieve the required linewidth, wavelength and power, including an extended cavity laser diode (ECLD) system and an on-chip grating, distributed feedback (DFB) GaN laser diode. © 2021 SPIE.

These advances in quantum information science have had a considerable impact on the development of photonic-based quantum sensors. Even though quantum radar and quantum lidar remain theoretical proposals, preliminary results suggest that these sensors have the potential of becoming disruptive technologies able to revolutionize reconnaissance systems. In this paper we will discuss how quantum entanglement can be exploited to increase the radar and lidar signature of rectangular targets. In particular, we will show how the effective visibility of the target is increased if observed with an entangled multi-photon quantum sensor. © 2013 SPIE.","Lidar; Quantum Entanglement; Quantum Information; Quantum Radar; Quantum Sensors; Radar","Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Radar; Reconnaissance aircraft; Sensors; Disruptive technology; Multiphotons; Quantum Information; Quantum information science; Quantum phenomena; Quantum sensors; Reconnaissance systems; Optical radar","","","","","","","Didomenico L.D., Lee H., Kok P., Dowling J.P., Quantum interferometric sensors, Proceedings of SPIE Quantum Sensing and Nanophotonic Devices, (2004); Dowling J.P., Quantum optical metrology - The lowdown on high-NOON states, Contemporary Physics, 49, 2, (2008); Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Quantum enhanced positioning and clock synchronization, Nature, 412-417; Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Quantum-enhanced measurements: Beating the standard quantum limit, Science, 306; Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Quantum metrology, Phys.

Processing, storing, and communicating this ever-growing amount of data pose challenges for the current IT infrastructure. Edge computing—an emerging paradigm to overcome the shortcomings of cloud-based computing—could address these challenges. Furthermore, emerging technologies such as quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communications have the potential to fill the performance gaps left by their classical counterparts. Here, we present the concept of an edge quantum computing (EQC) simulator—a platform for designing the next generation of edge computing applications. An EQC simulator is envisioned to integrate elements from both quantum technologies and edge computing to allow studies of quantum edge applications. The presented concept is motivated by the increasing demand for more sensitive and precise sensors that can operate faster at lower power consumption, generating both larger and denser datasets. These demands may be fulfilled with edge quantum sensor networks. Envisioning the EQC era, we present our view on how such a scenario may be amenable to quantification and design. Given the cost and complexity of quantum systems, constructing physical prototypes to explore design and optimization spaces is not sustainable, necessitating EQC infrastructure and component simulators to aid in co-design. We discuss what such a simulator may entail and possible use cases that invoke quantum computing at the edge integrated with new sensor infrastructures. © 2022 by the authors.","edge computing; quantum communication; quantum internet; quantum network; quantum processors; quantum sensing; quantum sensors; sensors","Edge computing; Integrated circuit design; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Sensor networks; Edge computing; Edge sensing; Quantum Computing; Quantum internet; Quantum network; Quantum processors; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Spatial scale; Spatial temporals; Quantum communication","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL","This work was supported in part by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

The interaction between a qubit detector and the environment is described by a unitary operator, and we will assume that at most one detector does interact. The task is to determine which one does or if none do. This involves choosing an initial state of the detectors and a measurement. We consider global measurements in which all detectors are measured simultaneously. We find that an entangled initial state can improve the detection probability, but this advantage decreases as the number of detectors increases.  © 2023 American Physical Society.","","Quantum entanglement; Detection probabilities; Global measurements; Initial state; Quantum sensors; Quantum state discrimination; Sensors network; Unitary operators; Sensor networks","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (FET-2106447)","This research was supported by NSF Grant No. FET-2106447.","Eldredge Z., Foss-Feig M., Gross J.

All mankind stands at the threshold of the so-called ""second quantum revolution"", and its short-term and long-term consequences will affect virtually all spheres of life of a global society. Such directions and branches of science and technology as materials science, nanotechnology, pharmacology and biochemistry in general, modeling of chaotic dynamic processes (nuclear explosions, turbulent flows, weather and long-term climatic phenomena), etc. will be directly developed, as well as the solution of any problems, which reduce to the multiplication of matrices of large dimensions (in particular, the modeling of quantum systems). However, along with extraordinary opportunities, quantum technologies carry with them certain risks and threats, in particular, the scrapping of all information systems based on modern achievements in cryptography, which will entail almost complete destruction of secrecy, the global financial crisis due to the destruction of the banking sector and compromise of all communication channels. Even in spite of the fact that methods of so-called ""post-quantum"" cryptography are already being developed today, some risks still need to be realized, since not all long-term consequences can be calculated. At the same time, one should be prepared to all of the above, including by training specialists working in the field of quantum technologies and understanding all their aspects, new opportunities, risks and threats. In this connection, this article briefly describes the current state of quantum technologies, namely, quantum sensorics, information transfer using quantum protocols, a universal quantum computer (hardware), and quantum computations based on quantum algorithms (software).

One of the fundamental questions hardly known is how quantum computing research is developing to support scientific advances and the evolution of path-breaking technologies for economic, industrial, and social change. This study confronts the question here by applying methods of computational scientometrics for publication analyses to explain the structure and evolution of quantum computing research and technologies over a 30-year period. Results reveal that the evolution of quantum computing from 1990 to 2020 has a considerable average increase of connectivity in the network (growth of degree centrality measure), a moderate increase of the average influence of nodes on the flow between nodes (little growth of betweenness centrality measure), and a little reduction of the easiest access of each node to all other nodes (closeness centrality measure). This evolutionary dynamics is due to the increase in size and complexity of the network in quantum computing research over time. This study also suggests that the network of quantum computing has a transition from hardware to software research that supports accelerated evolution of technological pathways in quantum image processing, quantum machine learning, and quantum sensors. Theoretical implications of this study show the morphological evolution of the network in quantum computing from a symmetric to an asymmetric shape driven by new inter-related research fields and emerging technological trajectories. Findings here suggest best practices of innovation management based on R&amp;D investments in new technological directions of quantum computing having a high potential for growth and impact in science and markets.

The unique quantum mechanisms of the action of bi-electronic sensors based on tangled two-electron excitations of quantum nanoelectromechanical systems of supra-atomic scale are investigated by using of the method quantum NEMS kinetics. The main stages of detection of attosecond pulse of soft X-ray radiation by the bi-electronic sensor are presented. Physicochemistry of relaxed bi-electronic quantum sensor of supra-atomic level in the FCC crystal lattice of the 4d-transition metal is considered on example of rhodium. The data of quantum kinetics, one-particle and radial two-particle distributions of atoms inside of sensor cube Rh500 at three temperatures: T = 1, 77, 293 K is numerically investigated. It is shown that this cubic two-electron sensor can detect an attosecond radiation pulse as a result of stable distortion and by accumulation of energy corresponding to soft X-ray quanta. © 2018 Author(s).","","","","","","","","","Dowling J.P., Milburn G.J., Phil.

A fundamental question is whether a quantum sensor is capable of uniquely inferring unknown parameters in a system for a given structure of the quantum sensor and admissible measurement on the sensor. In this paper, we investigate the capability of a class of quantum sensors which consist of either a single qubit or two qubits. A quantum sensor is coupled to a spin chain system to extract information of unknown parameters in the system. With given initialization and measurement schemes, we employ the similarity transformation approach and the Gröbner basis method to prove that a single-qubit quantum sensor cannot effectively estimate the unknown parameters in the spin chain system while the two-qubit quantum sensor can. The work demonstrates that it is a feasible method to enhance the capability of quantum sensors by increasing the number of qubits in the quantum sensors for some practical applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Quantum sensing; Quantum sensor; Quantum system identification; Similarity transformation approach; Spin chain system","Parameter estimation; Qubits; Spin dynamics; High sensitivity; High-precision; Physical systems; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Quantum system identification; Similarity transformation approach; Single qubits; Spin-chain systems; Two-qubit; Quantum optics","","","","","Asian Control Association; Office of Naval Research, ONR, (FA2386-16-1-4065); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung; Office of Naval Research Global, ONRG, (N62909-19-1-2129); Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP180101805, DP190101566); Australian Camps Association, ACA","Funding text 1: His research interests include quantum control and machine learning.

In the case of active radio- frequency quantum sensors, however, there exist several practical challenges, the most significant of which is the fast and efficient generation of a large number of entangled microwave photons. In a previous paper we proposed a method, called virtual modes, for mitigating this limitation by using a distributed architecture of quantum sensor units to synthetically increase the effective number of distinguishable modes available for target detection. Although this architecture was shown to incur an increase in noise cross-contamination, we showed that judicious sensor configurations can mitigate this effect. In this paper we examine more sophisticated cross-noise statistical models that permit the number and spatial distribution of sensors to be optimized to further reduce the net detection error probability of the proposed approach. © 2018 IEEE.","","Contamination; Probability distributions; Quantum entanglement; Cross contamination; Detection error probability; Distributed architecture; Microwave photon; Quantum illuminations; Quantum sensors; Radio frequencies; Sensor configurations; Microwave sensors","","","","","","","Lanzagorta M., Quantum Radar, (2011); Lanzagorta M., Uhlmann J., Le T., Improving quantum sensing with virtual modes, Proc.

This allows one to determine the optimal use of an entangled state for quantum sensing, even in complex systems where intuition from canonical squeezing examples breaks down. In this paper we show that the maximal obtainable sensitivity using a given quantum state is determined by the largest eigenvalue of the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) and the corresponding evolution is uniquely determined by the coinciding eigenvector. Since we optimize the process of parameter encoding rather than focusing on state preparation protocols, our scheme is relevant for any quantum sensor. This procedure naturally optimizes multiparameter estimation by determining, through the eigenvectors of the QFIM, the maximal set of commuting observables with optimal sensitivity.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10797114","","","37897766","English","Phys Rev Lett","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174877430"

This is done by entangling the photons that are used as the signal states. Using entanglement, the best possible image resolution is instead given by the Heisenberg limit, an improvement proportional to the number of entangled photons in the signal. Here, we present a novel application of entanglement by inverting the above procedure. We show that the resolution obtained by an imaging system utilizing separable photons can be achieved by an imaging system making use of entangled photons, but with the advantage of a smaller aperture. This results in a smaller, lighter imaging system.

This approach overcomes challenges associated with structuring traditional single-crystal quantum sensing platforms and enables the creation of complex, fully three-dimensional, sensor assemblies with submicroscale resolutions (down to 400 nm) and large fields of view (>1 mm). By embedding NV center-containing nanoparticles in exemplary structures, we demonstrate high sensitivity optical sensing of temperature and magnetic fields at the microscale. Our work showcases the potential for integrating quantum sensors with advanced manufacturing techniques, facilitating the incorporation of sensors into existing microfluidic and electronic platforms, and opening new avenues for widespread utilization of quantum sensors in various applications.","2-Photon Polymerization; Nanodiamond; NV Center; ODMR; Quantum Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15306992","","","37811908","English","Nano Lett","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175270418"

Speedway Blvd., Tucson, 85721, AZ, United States","With the help of entanglement, we can build quantum sensors with sensitivity better than that of classical sensors. In this paper we propose an entanglement assisted (EA) joint monostatic-bistatic quantum radar scheme, which significantly outperforms corresponding conventional ra-dars. The proposed joint monostatic-bistatic quantum radar is composed of two radars, one having both wideband entangled source and EA detector, and the second one with only an EA detector. The optical phase conjugation (OPC) is applied on the transmitter side, while classical coherent detection schemes are applied in both receivers. The joint monostatic-bistatic integrated EA transmitter is proposed suitable for implementation in LiNbO3 technology. The detection probability of the proposed EA joint target detection scheme outperforms significantly corresponding classical, coherent states-based quantum detection, and EA monostatic detection schemes. The proposed EA joint target detection scheme is evaluated by modelling the direct radar return and forward scattering channels as both lossy and noisy Bosonic channels, and assuming that the distribution of entanglement over idler channels is not perfect.

This paper presents a Gaussian quantum states-based quantum sensing paradigm. Gaussian quantum states have the advantage of being relatively easy to generate and manipulate in practice, and they can be used for realizing quantum sensors in the near term. Squeezed quantum states which are an example of Gaussian quantum states can improve the estimation accuracy by reducing the quantum shot noise in one of the quadratures. We present two prototypical examples of Gaussian states-based quantum sensing applications, including quadrature estimation and channel transmittance estimation of a lossy bosonic Gaussian channel. We show that improved estimation can be achieved for both problems by using squeezed states compared to classical coherent states.  © 2023 IEEE.","bosonic Gaussian channel; Gaussian quantum states; quantum metrology; quantum parameter estimation; Quantum sensors","Bosons; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Quantum optics; Shot noise; Bosonic gaussian channel; Gaussian channels; Gaussian quantum state; Of quantum-information; Parameters estimation; Quantum metrology; Quantum parameter estimation; Quantum parameters; Quantum sensors; State based; Parameter estimation","","","","","Australian Government; Australian Research Council, ARC, (FT200100928)","Matthew R.

At present a number of quantum computers have been realized in hardware, typically with only a few qubits and with performance limitations including short coherence times, difficult coupling to input/output processing, and strong susceptibility to noise in the ambient environment. However, the separate but closely related field of quantum sensing shows much more near-term promise in respect of its applicability to broad classes of systems and missions, including many types of aerospace systems, sensors, and the processing and evaluation of their data. This paper reviews the basic methodology and types of quantum sensing, some history of related measurements and proof-of-concept experiments, and assesses the potential applicability of quantum sensing techniques to future aerospace sensors and systems. Performance metrics using published models and demonstration experiments show distinct performance advantages in several cases and are used to compare near-term quantum sensing to more conventional systems. In addition, the application of quantum communication to networked systems is discussed, along with the potential for novel data fusion techniques using quantum-inspired protocols and methods. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Optical interferometers are used in a vast range of applications, including metrology, surface profiling, microfluidics, and mechanical stress or strain measurement and velocimetry. These instruments operate by combining two or more light sources so that interference fringe patterns are produced. Information derived from such fringe measurements is used to determine precise wavelength and to measure very small distances and thicknesses. The quantum sensor design used by the researchers at the university is a conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometer with the classical laser light source replaced with a quantum squeezed light source. The classical intensity difference counting has also been replaced with a more detailed photon counting scheme in the proposed design for conducting investigations.","","Design; Interferometers; Light sources; Quantum optics; Sensors; Stresses; Intensity difference; Interference fringe pattern; Laser light sources; Louisiana State University; Mechanical stress; Optical interferometer; Photon counting; Quantum properties; Quantum sensors; Squeezed light sources; Surface profiling; Velocimetry; Quantum theory","","","","","","","","M.

If entangled photons are used as signal states, the best possible resolution is instead given by the Heisenberg limit, an improvement proportional to the number of entangled photons in the signal. In this letter, we present a novel application of entanglement by showing that the resolution obtained by an imaging system utilizing separable photons can be achieved by an imaging system making use of entangled photons, but with the advantage of a smaller aperture, thus resulting in a smaller and lighter system. This can be especially valuable in satellite imaging where weight and size play a vital role. © 2007 IEEE.","Entanglement; N00N states; Quantum interferometry; Rayleigh limit","Image resolution; Imaging systems; Optical sensors; Photons; Satellite imagery; Entangled photons; Heisenberg limit; Quantum interferometry; Quantum sensor; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2000); Ekert A.K., Quantum cryptography based on Bell's theorem, Phys.

Recently, cryptographic quantum metrology was investigated where the information of the magnetic fields is transmitted in a secure way. However, sometimes, the positions where non-zero magnetic fields are generated could carry important information. Here, we propose an anonymous quantum sensor where an information of positions having non-zero magnetic fields is hidden after measuring magnetic fields with a quantum-sensing network. Suppose that participants are located in different positions and they have quantum sensors. After the quantum sensors are entangled, the participants implement quantum sensing that provides a phase information if non-zero magnetic fields exist, and POVM measurement is performed on quantum sensors. Importantly, even if the outcomes of the POVM measurement is stolen by an eavesdropper, information of the positions with non-zero magnetic fields is still unknown for the eavesdropper in our protocol. Here, tracelessness is guaranteed, and so our protocol is considered as anonymous. In addition, we evaluate the sensitivity of our proposed quantum sensors by using Fisher information when there are at most two positions having non-zero magnetic fields. We show that the sensitivity is finite unless these two (non-zero) magnetic fields have exactly the same amplitude. Our results pave the way for new applications of quantum-sensing network. © 2022 The Physical Society of Japan","","","","","","","MEXT Q-LEAP, (JPMJPF2014, JPMXS0118067394, JPMXS0120319794); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT; Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (JPMJPR1919); Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, CREST, (JPMJCR15N2, JPMJCR1774, JPMJMS2061)","Acknowledgements This work was supported by Leading Initiative for Excellent Young Researchers MEXT Japan and JST presto (Grant No. JPMJPR1919) Japan.

The first area we call Quantum (Data Fusion) and refers to the use of quantum computers to perform data fusion algorithms with classical data generated by quantum and classical sensors. As we discuss, we expect that these quantum fusion algorithms will have a better computational complexity than traditional fusion algorithms. This means that quantum computers could allow the efficient fusion of large data sets for complex multi-target tracking. On the other hand, (Quantum Data) Fusion refers to the fusion of quantum data that is being generated by quantum sensors. The output of the quantum sensors is considered in the form of qubits, and a quantum computer performs data fusion algorithms.

The talk will describe a novel matter-photon interface based on defects in solids. Efficient spin to photon conversion and multimode optical storage as well as processing will be described. Quite intriguingly, the same spin-photon interfaces can be used for novel quantum sensors converting e.g. magnetic and electric fields or even force into photonics signals with unprecedented sensitivity.","","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electric fields; Quantum communication; Quantum optics; Defects in solids; Matter qubits; Multimodes; Optical Storage; Photon conversion; Photon state; Quantum Information; Quantum signals; Quantum technologies; Spin-on; Photons","","","","","","","","","","Optica Publishing Group (formerly OSA)","","European Quantum Electronics Conference, EQEC 2017","25 June 2017 through 29 June 2017","Munich","138998","21622701","978-150906736-7; 978-150906736-7","","","English","Opt.

This technological paradigm-switch creates opportunities and challenges for industry, innovation and society. Several large companies, as well as start-ups, have started to develop and engineer quantum devices or begun to integrate them into their products: the commercial success of QT, together with progress in research and development, relies on certification and reliability built upon internationally agreed standards and metrological traceability. A group of European National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and Delegated Institutes (DIs) have recently created a European Metrology Network for Quantum Technologies (EMN-Q) under the auspices of EURAMET. The objective of the EMN-Q is to co-ordinate the activities of the European NMIs and Dis to ensure their efficient support for European competitiveness in quantum technologies. A special focus of the EMN-Q will be to develop new measurement capabilities and dedicated services to serve the rapidly-growing needs of industry and research institutions in this field. Industry, governmental agencies, academic sectors or any other type of stakeholder are welcome to contact the EMN-Q and discuss their metrology needs. These can relate not only to quantum characteristics of quantum devices, but also to metrology of key enabling technologies, metrology that can improve the supply chain of industrial quantum devices or other industrial needs connected with quantum technologies. EMN-Q aims to become is to become the central contact point to stakeholders interested in metrology for quantum technologies by: • contributing to standardisation & certification of quantum technologies; • promoting the take-up of metrology in the development of these technologies; • supporting industrial needs in synergy with the technological objectives of the EC Quantum Flagship and national quantum technology programs; and • promoting the use of quantum measurement techniques where advantageous for “classical” technical areas. We are in process of structuring and developing the communication services of the EMN-Q. One of the key aspect in this EMN-Q development is the establishment the EMN-Q Strategic Research Agenda (SRA). The SRA will contain the technological roadmaps that are created by the EMN-Q members in consultation with the EMN-Q Stakeholder Community. In this paper, we will provide a short overview of the EMN-Q organization, and of the SRA and the relative Technological Roadmaps. © 2021","European metrology network; Quantum metrology; Quantum technologies","European metrology network; Industry innovations; Large companies; National metrology institutes; Quantum device; Quantum metrology; Quantum technologies; Research and development; Roadmap; Strategic research agendas; Supply chains","","","","","European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research, EMPIR; Horizon 2020","This paper is based on the activities carried on in the project 19NET02 Quantum. 19NET02 Quantum has received funding from the EMPIR programme co-financed by the Participating States and from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme .","“Directive on privacy and electronic communications”, directive of the European parliament 2002/58/EC (12 July 2002), Official Journal of the European Communities, 31, 7, (2002); General data protection regulation (GDPR), see the EU GDPR website; CCTF: Report of the 19th Meeting, (2012); Riehle F., “Requirements on Time and Frequency Transfer for Frequency Standards Comparisons and for a Redefinition of the Second,” BIPM Workshop on Development of Advanced Time and Frequency Transfer Techniques, (2011); EMRP Outline Document, (2008); Coordination of the development of advanced time and frequency transfer techniques; Quantum technologies flagship (intermediate report), High-Level Steering Committee, (2017); Quantum Technologies Flagship Final Report, (2017)","I.P.

For ODMR based sensing, CMOS quantum sensors seek an onchip 2.87 GHz microwave (MW) signal generator. Moreover, in order to sense smaller |\tilde{\mathrm{B}}|, these CMOS quantum sensors also require that MW signal should be swept with sufficiently small step-size near 2.87 GHz. In this work, we present a fractional-N synthesizer based 2.87 GHz MW-generator (MWG) with an extremely small programmable sweep step-size for improved sensitivity of |\tilde{\mathrm{B}}| measurements in CMOS NV magnetometry. The proposed MWG is implemented in 180 nm CMOS technology and simulations were done to validate the proposed design. Post-layout simulation results show that the proposed MWG achieves a minimum sweep-step size of 50 kHz, which can be used to sense |\tilde{\mathrm{B}}|\lt 0.9\;\mu \mathrm{T} and exhibits a phase noise of-114.5 dBc/Hz at an offset of 1 MHz near 2.87 GHz center frequency. © 2022 IEEE.","CMOS; colour-defect; diamond; magnetometry; nitrogen-vacancy; ODMR; Quantum-sensing; sensitivity","CMOS integrated circuits; Color; Diamonds; Environmental technology; Magnetic resonance; Magnetometers; Magnetometry; CMOS; CMOS technology; Color-defect; Nitrogen vacancies; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Quantum sensors; Quantum-sensing; Sensing applications; Sensitivity; Step size; Nitrogen","","","","","","","Ibrahim M.I., Foy C., Englund D.R., Han R., High-Scalability CMOS Quantum Magnetometer With Spin-State Excitation and Detection of Diamond Color Centers, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, 56, 3, pp. 1001-1014, (2021); Kim D., Ibrahim M.I., Foy C., Trusheim M.E., Han R., Englund D.R., A CMOS-Integrated Quantum Sensor Based on Nitrogen-Vacancy Centres, Nature Electron., 2, 7, pp. 284-289, (2019); Ibrahim M.I., Foy C., Englund D.R., Han R., 29. 2 A Scalable Quantum Magnetometer in 65nm CMOS with Vector-Field Detection Capability, 2019 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference-(ISSCC), pp. 458-461, (2019); Ibrahim M.I., Foy C., Kim D., Englund D.R., Han R., Room-Temperature Quantum Sensing in CMOS: On-Chip Detection of Electronic Spin States in Diamond Color Centers for Magnetometry, 2018 IEEE Symposium on VLSI Circuits, pp. 249-250, (2018); Razavi B., RF Microelectronics, (1997); Kong L., Razavi B., A 2. 4 GHz 4 mW Integer-N Inductorless RF Synthesizer, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, 51, 3, pp. 626-635, (2016); Jia S., Yan S., Wang Y., Zhang G., A Low-Power High-Speed 32/33 Prescaler Based on Novel Divide-by-4/5 Unit with Improved True Single-Phase Clock Logic, 2015 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), pp. 890-893, (2015); Rabaey J.M., Digital Integrated Circuits: A Design Perspective, (1996); Razavi B., Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits, (2001); Lin T., Ti C., Liu Y., Dynamic Current-Matching Charge Pump and Gated-Offset Linearization Technique for Delta-Sigma Fractional-N PLLs, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers, 56, 5, pp. 877-885, (2009); Srivastava A., Et al., Bio-WiTel: A Low-Power Integrated Wireless Telemetry System for Healthcare Applications in 401-406 MHz Band of MedRadio Spectrum, IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 22, 2, pp. 483-494, (2018); Kong L., Razavi B., 19. 5 A 2. 4GHz RF Fractional-N Synthesizer with 0. 25fREF BW, 2017 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), pp. 330-331, (2017); Kong L., Razavi B., A 2. 4-GHz 6. 4-mW Fractional-N Inductorless RF Synthesizer, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, 52, 8, pp. 2117-2127, (2017)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Cadence; et al.; Mediatek; Samsung; Silicon Labs; Synopsys","2022 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, ISCAS 2022","27 May 2022 through 1 June 2022","Austin","184263","02714310","978-166548485-5","PICSD","","English","Proc IEEE Int Symp Circuits Syst","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142489552"

Existing perimeter intrusion detection schemes, if using light, rely on the classical properties of light only. Our quantum sensor network uses the quantum property of spatial superposition of photons, meaning that a photon can simultaneously follow two different paths after going through a beam splitter. Using multiple Mach–Zehnder interferometers, an entire web of paths can be generated, such that one single photon occupies them all. If an intruder violates this web in some arbitrary point, the entire photon superposition is destroyed, the photon does not self-interfere any more and this event is detected by measurements. For one single photon, the intruder detection probability is limited theoretically but can be increased arbitrarily with the usage of a sequence of photons. We show both theoretical bounds as well as practical results of the proposed schemes. The practical results are obtained by simulation experiments on IBM Quantum platforms. The benefits of our quantum approach are: low power, invisibility to potential intruders, scalability and easy practical implementation. © 2022 by the authors.","low-power sensor; perimeter intrusion detection; quantum sensor networks; quantum sensors; single photon interferometry","Intrusion detection; Light; Low power electronics; Particle beams; Photons; Simulation platform; Intrusion-Detection; Low power sensor; Perimeter detection; Perimeter intrusion detection; Quantum sensor network; Quantum sensors; Sensors network; Single Photon Interferometry; Single photons; Sensor networks","","","","","","","Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2010); Montanaro A., Quantum algorithms: An overview, npj Quantum Inf, 2, (2016); Zoo Q.A., Algebraic and Number Theoretic Algorithms; Pirandola S., Andersen U.L., Banchi L., Berta M., Bunandar D., Colbeck R., Englund D., Gehring T., Lupo C., Ottaviani C., Et al., Advances in quantum cryptography, Adv.

Viscoelasticity is also interconnected with other biophysical properties, such as temperature, which is known to influence cellular bioenergetics. Probing the connections between intracellular temperature and cytoplasmic viscoelasticity provides an exciting opportunity for the study of biological phenomena, such as metabolism and disease progression. The small length scales and transient nature of changes in these parameters combined with their complex interdependencies pose a challenge for biosensing tools, which are often limited to a single readout modality. Here, we present a dual-mode quantum sensor capable of performing simultaneous nanoscale thermometry and rheometry in dynamic cellular environments. We use nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond nanocrystals as biocompatible sensors for in vitro measurements. We combine subdiffraction resolution single-particle tracking in a fluidic environment with optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to perform simultaneous sensing of viscoelasticity and temperature. We use our sensor to demonstrate probing of the temperature-dependent viscoelasticity in complex media at the nanoscale. We then investigate the interplay between intracellular forces and the cytoplasmic rheology in live cells. Finally, we identify different rheological regimes and reveal evidence of active trafficking and details of the nanoscale viscoelasticity of the cytoplasm.","biosensing; nanodiamond; nitrogen-vacancy center; quantum sensing; rheometry; single particle tracking; thermometry","Diamond; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Nanoparticles; Temperature; Thermometry; diamond; nanoparticle; chemistry; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; procedures; temperature; thermometry","","diamond, 7782-40-3; Diamond, ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1936086X","","","37791968","English","ACS Nano","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175269677"

In the quantum radar context, however, most theoretical performance analyses to date have assumed static targets. In this paper we consider the Doppler effect at the single photon level. In particular, we describe how the Doppler effect produced by clutter and moving targets modifies the quantum distinguishability and the quantum radar error detection probability equations. Furthermore, we show that Doppler-based delayline cancelers can reduce the effects of clutter in the context of quantum radar, but only in the low-brightness regime. Thus, quantum radar may prove to be an important technology if the electronic battlefield requires stealthy tracking and detection of moving targets in the presence of clutter. © 2016 SPIE.","Clutter attenuation; Doppler effect; Electronic warfare; Quantum information; Quantum radar; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Radar; Radar clutter; Radar countermeasures","Clutter (information theory); Doppler effect; Electronic warfare; Particle beams; Quantum optics; Radar; Radar clutter; Radar countermeasures; Radar equipment; Tracking radar; Detection probabilities; Distinguishability; Moving targets; Quantum Information; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Single-photon level; Theoretical performance; Radar systems","","","","","","","Lanzagorta M., Quantum Radar, (2011); Lanzagorta M., Low-brightness quantum radar, Proceedings of the SPIE Defense, Security and Sensing: Radar Sensor Technology, (2015); Lanzagorta M., Amplification of radar and lidar signatures using quantum sensors, Proc.

Three dimensional high-coherence time microwave cavities embedded with electro-optic nonlinear dielectric materials provide promising platforms to boost the efficiency of the microwave-optic frequency conversion. However, so far, the properties for such dielectric crystals operating at milli-Kelvin cryogenic temperatures have not been well understood. Here, we propose a scheme to precisely measure and benchmark the dielectric constant and analyze the dissipation mechanisms of electro-optic materials, such as Lithium Niobate, at the quantum threshold. We will use Fermilab's three dimensional superconducting cavities with long coherence time.

With the help of entanglement we can build quantum sensors whose sensitivity is better than that of classical sensors. In this paper we are concerned with the entanglement assisted (EA) bistatic quantum radar applications. By employing the optical phase conjugation (OPC) on transmitter side and classical coherent detection on receiver side we show that the detection probability of the proposed EA target detection scheme is significantly better than that of corresponding classical and coherent states-based quantum detection schemes. The proposed EA target detection scheme is evaluated by modelling the radar return channel as the lossy and noisy Bosonic channel and assuming imperfect distribution of entanglement over the idler channel.  © 2013 IEEE.","Entanglement; Entanglement assisted quantum radars; Quantum radars; Quantum sensing; Radars","Object detection; Optical transmitters; Quantum optics; Tracking radar; Coherent detection; Detection scheme; Entanglement; Entanglement assisted quantum radar; Quantum information processing; Quantum radar; Quantum sensing; Radar detection; Targets detection; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Djordjevic I.B., Quantum Communication, Quantum Networks and Quantum Sensing, (2022); Djordjevic I.B., Quantum Information Processing, Quantum Computing and Quantum Error Correction: An Engineering Approach, 2nd ed, (2021); Cariolaro G., Quantum Communications, (2015); Djordjevic I.B., Physical-Layer Security and Quantum Key Distribution, (2019); Guha S., Erkmen B.I., Gaussian-state quantum-illumination receivers for target detection, Phys.

In our recent paper, we showed that the entanglement-assisted (EA) joint monostatic–bistatic quantum radar performs much better than conventional radars. Here, we propose an entanglement-assisted (EA) multistatic radar that significantly outperforms EA bistatic, coherent state-based quantum, and classical radars. The proposed EA multistatic radar employs multiple entangled transmitters performing transmit-side optical phase conjugation, multiple coherent detection-based receivers serving as EA detectors, and a joint detector. © 2022 by the author.","entanglement; entanglement-assisted detection; quantum radars; quantum sensing; radars","","","","","","","","Holevo A.S., Werner R.F., Evaluating capacities of Bosonic Gaussian channels, Phys.

We investigate how the number of sensors and fidelity affect sensitivity to continuous and intermittent signals. For continuous signals, we find that increasing the number of sensors by 1/F2 for F<1 always recovers the sensitivity achieved when F=1. However, when the signal is intermittent, more sensors are needed to recover the sensitivity achievable with one perfect quantum sensor. We also demonstrate the importance of near-unity control fidelity and readout at the quantum projection noise limit by estimating the frequency components of a stochastic, intermittent signal with a single trapped ion sensor. Quantum sensing has historically focused on large ensembles of sensors operated far from the standard quantum limit. The results presented in this paper show that this is insufficient for quantum sensing of intermittent signals and reemphasizes the importance of the unique scaling of quantum projection noise near an eigenstate. © 2021 American Physical Society.","","Economic and social effects; Trapped ions; Eigen state; Frequency components; Noise limit; Quantum sensors; Single trapped ion; Standard quantum limits; Stochastic signals; Trade off; Stochastic systems","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2011973, 2016245)","","Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Nat.

Particularly, many current and future space assets are of dual-use character or specifically designed for military and intelligence purposes. This also applies to quantum technologies. In this contribution, we study possible space-born quantum technologies for defence and intelligence that have the greatest potential to exploit these technologies to the maximum and across the full spectrum of quantum technologies. Their utilisation will lead to joint networks of quantum sensing and quantum communications with other emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and laser communication with deployment around the Earth. On the other side, space-based quantum technology design should reflect threats such as laser anti-satellite weapons in the case of larger conflicts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-satellite weapons; Laser communication; Quantum communication; Quantum network; Quantum sensing; Quantum technology; Space","","","","","","České Vysoké Učení Technické v Praze, ČVUT","Michal Krelina reports administrative support and article publishing charges were provided by Czech Technical University in Prague.

We demonstrate how to select different protocols from this family under various constraints. Focusing primarily on entanglement-based constraints, we prove the surprising result that highly entangled states are not necessary to achieve optimality in many cases. Specifically, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal protocols using at most k-partite entanglement. We prove that the protocols which satisfy these conditions use the minimum amount of entanglement possible, even when given access to arbitrary controls and ancillas. Our protocols require some amount of time-dependent control, and we show that a related class of time-independent protocols fail to achieve optimal scaling for generic functions.  © 2023 authors.

A brief review is made on two primary quantum information processing tasks, being quantum communication and quantum sensing. Quantum communication is additionally divided into quantum cryptography and quantum blockchain, respectively. In quantum cryptography, the feature of security in quantum cryptosystems is commented upon. Quantum blockchain encompasses the nature and the networking of the framework to witness decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger in quantum domain. Finally, the emergence of quantum sensing from particles/systems that are described by quantum mechanics, like photons, is introduced. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Distributed ledger; Quantum communication; Quantum cryptography; Quantum optics; Block-chain; Decentralised; Of quantum-information; Particles system; Quantum cryptosystems; Quantum domain; Quantum information processing; Quantum technologies; Blockchain","","","","","Admar Mutt Education Foundation, AMEF","V.

Initially distinguished by high levels of international scientific cooperation, a 'quantum race' is heating up across multiple sectors and between major powers, who recognise that technological prowess will be a key determinant of geostrategic, as well as economic supremacy in the 21st century. Quantum is seen as a critical emerging technology in this rivalry, with the potential for full-spectrum applications in warfare, including quantum computers that enhance the capabilities of AI and machine learning, improve the performance of lethal autonomous weapons systems and increase the capacity for analysing large datasets; quantum algorithms that break classical encryption while quantum networks provide completely secure communications; and quantum sensors that provide more sensitive detection, measurement and control of the physical environment. In a densely networked, information-saturated battlespace requiring accelerated decision-making, quantum computers, communications, control and artificial intelligence (QC3AI) has the potential to further reduce the human element in future warfare. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Artur Gruszczak and Sebastian Kaempf.

Starting from the first two-photon experiment by Hong-Ou-Mandel [1], it has been shown that multiphoton interference lies at the heart of computational complexity in linear optical interferometers, the most notable example being provided by the Boson Sampling model [2]. This model corresponds to sampling from the evolution of n indistinguishable photons in a multimode linear network, and has been shown to be hard to simulate classicaly thus representing a promising route to experimentally reach the quantum advantage regime. It has been shown, however, that genuine multiparticle interference is necessary for high computational complexity. Hence, appropriate methods for detection of such feature should be developed since the complexity of problem prevents the application of trivial methods. © 2019 IEEE","","Complex networks; Computational complexity; Linear networks; Photons; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Simulation platform; Indistinguishability; Key feature; Linear optical; Multiphoton interference; Multiphotons; Optical interferometer; Quantum Computing; Quantum simulations; Sampling model; Two photon; Quantum chemistry","","","","","","","Hong C.K., Ou Z.Y., Mandel L., Measurement of subpicosecond time intervals between two photons by interference, Phys.

We report our latest results on a range of AlGaInN diode-lasers targeted to meet the linewidth, wavelength and power requirements suitable for quantum sensors such as optical clocks and cold-atom interferometry systems. This includes the [5s2S1/2-5p2P1/2] cooling transition in strontium+ ion optical clocks at 422 nm, the [5s21S0-5p1P1] cooling transition in neutral strontium clocks at 461 nm and the [5s2s1/2 - 6p2P3/2] transition in rubidium at 420 nm. Several approaches are taken to achieve the required linewidth, wavelength and power, including an extended cavity laser diode (ECLD) system and an on-chip grating, distributed feedback (DFB) GaN laser diode.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

As progress towards a future quantum internet continues, connecting mobile platforms (e.g., unmanned drones, smart vehicles, ships, and planes) to quantum networks remains a challenge. For instance, engineering constraints for real-world mobile platforms require low size, weight, and power (SWaP) for quantum systems. Additionally, single photons must be routed to platforms that are in motion and experience vibrations. In this effort, we discuss progress toward developing and demonstrating quantum communication links, including decoy-state quantum key distribution (QKD), between mobile drone and vehicle platforms in several configurations (drone-to-drone, drone-to-moving vehicle, and vehicle-to-vehicle). We will discuss and analyze critical subsystems including our decoy-state QKD source based on resonant cavity light emitting diodes (LED), compact optical system design, pointing, acquisition, and tracking (PAT) subsystem, single-photon detectors, field-programmable gate array-based time-tagger, and a novel time-synchronization algorithm. In addition, we present system performance including tracking performance under multiple conditions and mobile platform configurations. © 2023 SPIE.","Autonomous Drones; Decoy-State QKD; Free-Space Quantum Communications; Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)","Drilling platforms; Drones; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Optical systems; Particle beams; Photons; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Autonomous drone; Decoy state; Decoy-state quantum key distribution; Distributed quantum computing; Free spaces; Free-space quantum communication; Mobile platform; Quantum key distribution; Quantum network; Quantum sensors; Quantum cryptography","","","","","Illinois Center for Transportation; Southwestern Ohio Council for Higher Education; U.S. Department of Defense, DOD; Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate, NDSEG","This research effort is supported in part by the Department of Defense (DoD) through the National Defense Science Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship Program, by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) through the Southwestern Ohio Council for Higher Education Fellowship Program, and by the Illinois Center for Transportation (ICT) through the Smart Transportation Infrastructure Initiative (STII).

Since its initial concepts in the early 1900s built upon extensive research of Nobel laureates such as Max Planck, Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein, and Richard Feynman, amongst others to the first proposed quantum computers by Paul Benioff in 1980, the concept of quantum technologies has evolved. Two central studies derived from quantum mechanics that can support and revolutionize future wireless technologies are quantum computers and quantum communications. The investigation for building the next generation of wireless networks has begun. Therefore, many technological opportunities for applying innovative solutions and advanced concepts are on the table as an option to unlock the full potential of 6G for providing an intelligent, superfast, and secure network. Having said that, quantum mechanics come into play to offer a breakthrough opportunity that will change the world since the popularization of the Internet, and it will propel 6G use cases to be remarkably successful, but only if quantum physics can be engineered and converged into the fore-mentioned quantum technologies to support the achievement of Society 5.0. Therefore, overcoming the quantum challenges, 6G can benefit in many ways. One of them is Quantum computing (QC) that will surpass the computational capabilities of classic computers limited by binary transactions known as bits to resolve future challenges using quantum states to process information in quantum bits (Qubits). Correspondingly, quantum computing will merge with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create a new model known as Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to deal with the exponential growth of Big Data faster than any existing computational model. In Addition, quantum communications will deliver a safer network, utilizing Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and inaugurate the next generation of the Internet, much safer for all. Thus, this paper presents a holistic overview of Quantum as a service (QaaS) as a future deployment in the 6G architecture, but only if quantum technologies can be mastered in the next upcoming years. Most likely that QaaS will become available for commercial purposes by the hyperscalers, the ones able to cope with the total cost of ownership (TCO) of these state of art technologies. © 2022 River Publishers","6G; AI; big data; electromagnetic radiation; QaaS; quantum communications infrastructure (QCI); quantum computing; quantum key distribution (QKD); quantum machine learning; quantum mechanics; TCO","Atomic physics; Electromagnetic waves; Machine learning; Next generation networks; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum optics; Statistical Physics; 6g; Communication infrastructure; Machine-learning; Quantum as a service; Quantum communication infrastructure; Quantum Computing; Quantum key distribution; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Total cost of ownership; Big data","","","","","","","Rufino Henrique P.

This model is general enough to accommodate stray-photon noise along the propagation, as well as amplitude attenuation. An explicit analytical expression for the density matrix as a function of propagation distance is obtained for completely general input states with bounded photon number in each mode. The result is analyzed numerically for various examples of input states. For N00N state input, the loss of coherence and entanglement is super exponential, as predicted by a number of previous studies. However, for generic input states, where the coefficients are generated randomly, the decay of coherence is very different; in fact no worse than the classical Beer-Lambert law. More surprisingly, there is a plateau at a mid-range interval in propagation distance where the loss is in fact sub-classical, following which it resumes the classical rate. The qualitative behavior of the decay of entanglement for two-mode propagation is also analyzed numerically for ensembles of random states using the behavior of negativity as a function of propagation distance. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Entanglement; lossy propagation; quantum metrology; quantum sensors","Photons; Analytical expressions; Entanglement; Non-classical lights; Propagation distances; Qualitative behavior; Quantum metrology; Quantum sensors; Super-exponential; Quantum entanglement","","","","","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA","I am grateful to Gabriel Durkin for useful correspondence on the quantitative description of entanglement in mixed states.

MFL was tested at room-temperature using a setup detecting state-dependent fluorescence via confocal microscopy, and a microwave controlled NV defect in bulk diamond as a sensor [2].

Efficient coupling of RF signals into a particular quantum system requires the utilization of carefully designed and fabricated antennas. Nitrogen vacancy (NV) defects in diamond are commonly utilized platforms in quantum sensing experiments with the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) method, where an RF antenna is an essential element. We report on the design and fabrication of high efficiency coplanar RF antennas for quantum sensing applications. Single and double ring coplanar RF antennas were designed with -37 dB experimental return loss at 2.87 GHz, the zero-field splitting frequency of the negatively charged NV defect in diamond. The efficiency of both antennas was demonstrated in magnetic field sensing experiments with NV color centers in diamond. An RF amplifier was not needed, and the 0 dB output of a standard RF signal generator was adequate to run the ODMR experiments due to the high efficiency of the RF antennas.  © 2023 Author(s).","","Color centers; Diamonds; Magnetic resonance; Quantum optics; Radio waves; Frequency antennas; Higher efficiency; Nitrogen vacancies; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Quantum applications; Radiofrequencies; Radiofrequency signals; Sensing applications; Spin state; Vacancy Defects; Efficiency","","","","","Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Agency, (DE-FOA-0003945); National Science Foundation, NSF, (1831954, 2101102); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-19-1-0122)","This material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. 1831954 and 2101102, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under Grant No. FA9550-19-1-0122.

We report our latest results on a range of AlGaInN diode-lasers targeted to meet the linewidth, wavelength and power requirements suitable for optical clocks and cold-atom interferometry systems. This includes the [5s2S1/2-5p2P1/2] cooling transition in strontium+ ion optical clocks at 422 nm, the [5s21S0-5p1P1] cooling transition in neutral strontium clocks at 461 nm and the [5s2s1/2 - 6p2P3/2] transition in rubidium at 420 nm.

Thousands of research labs are developing and testing a broad range of sensor prototypes. However, there is a lack of knowledge about specific applications and real-world use cases where the benefits of these sensors will be most pronounced. This study presents a comprehensive review of quantum sensing state-of-practice. It also provides a detailed analysis of how quantum sensing overcomes the existing limitations of sensor-driven systems' precision and performance. Based on the review of over 500 quantum sensor prototype reports, we determined four groups of quantum sensors and discussed their readiness for commercial usage. We concluded that quantum magnetometry and quantum optics are the most advanced sensing technologies with empirically proven results. In turn, quantum timing and kinetics are still in the early stages of practical validation. In addition, we defined four systems domains in which quantum sensors offer a solution for existing limitations of conventional sensing technologies. These domains are 1) GPS-free positioning and navigating services, 2) time-based operations, 3) topological visibility, and 4) environment detection, prediction, and modeling. Finally, we discussed the current constraints of quantum sensing technologies and offered directions for future research. © 2013 IEEE.","quantum computing; quantum information science; Quantum sensing technology; quantum sensors; quantum systems","Magnetometers; Magnetometry; Quantum optics; Superconducting magnets; Current rise; Extraterrestrial measurements; Quantum information science; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensing technology; Quantum sensors; Quantum system; Sensing technology; Sensitivity; System applications; Temperature measurement","","","","","","","Alfieri A., Anantharaman S.B., Zhang H., Jariwala D., Nanomaterials for quantum information science and engineering, Adv.

In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that the combination of171Yb+ atomic sensors with adequately trained neural networks enables us to investigate target fields in distinct challenging scenarios. In particular, we characterize radio frequency (RF) fields in the presence of large shot noise, including the limit case of continuous data acquisition via single-shot measurements. Furthermore, by incorporating neural networks we significantly extend the working regime of atomic magnetometers into scenarios in which the RF driving induces responses beyond their standard harmonic behavior. Our results indicate the benefits to integrate neural networks at the data processing stage of general quantum sensing tasks to decipher the information contained in the sensor responses. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Data acquisition; Data handling; Shot noise; Atomic magnetometers; Atomic sensors; Continuous data; Exposed to; Neural-networks; Radio frequency fields; Radiofrequencies; Single-shot measurements; Target fields; Trained neural networks; Magnetometers","","","","","Dispositivos en Tecnologías Cuánticas, (IT1470-22, KK-2022/00062); Hacia una especialización armonizada en tecnologías cuánticas en BRTA, (KK-2022/00041); Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0301200, 2021ZD0301604); Ramón y Cajal, (RYC2018-025197-I); Spanish Government, (EUR2020-112117, PID2021-126694NB-C21); Students’ Innovation and Entrepreneurship Foundation of USTC, (828826); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11734015, 11774335); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (QYZDY-SSWSLH003); Eusko Jaurlaritza, (KK-2021/00070); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFA0304100)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2017YFA0304100), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 11774335 and 11734015), the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (No. QYZDY-SSWSLH003), Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology (Nos. 2021ZD0301604 and 2021ZD0301200).

A potentially impactful application, namely the detection of time-varying signals in noise or clutter, is a crucial component for advanced radar detection systems and surveillance networks. This particular application was recently introduced in a quantum context, along with optimal control protocols to minimize the detection error rates. Here, we experimentally execute this quantum signal detection protocol and show that it remains effective when applied to real-world communications signals that do not meet the assumptions of the original formulation of the protocol, due to their non-Gaussian nature. We also consider another class of signals motivated by pulsed radar, which presents challenges for the quantum signal detection protocol due to their intermittent nature. Despite this, we demonstrate that additional classical processing of the quantum observations may be used to determine the presence of the signal. These results further extend the potential of quantum sensing techniques to operationally relevant, quantum-enhanced receive chains in passive or bistatic sensing scenarios. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Our approach leverages recent proposals that analyze the benefits of adopting classical machine learning to post-process quantum data in quantum sensing protocols [1]. MFL was tested at room-temperature using a setup detecting state-dependent fluorescence via confocal microscopy, and a microwave controlled NV defect in bulk diamond as a sensor [2]. This setup senses the intensity of a magnetic field B in the proximity of the quantum sensor via Ramsey interferometry [3].

Distributing a quantum circuit across a quantum network is one way to facilitate large computations using current quantum computers. In this paper, we consider the problem of distributing a quantum circuit across a network of heterogeneous quantum computers, while minimizing the number of teleportations (the communication cost) needed to implement gates spanning multiple computers. We design two algorithms for this problem. The first, called Local-Best, initially distributes the qubits across the network, then tries to teleport qubits only when necessary, with teleportations being influenced by gates in the near future. The second, called Zero-Stitching, divides the given circuit into sub-circuits such that each sub-circuit can be executed using zero teleportations and the teleportation cost incurred at the borders of the sub-circuits is minimal. We evaluate our algorithms over a wide range of randomly-generated circuits as well as known benchmarks, and compare their performance to prior work. We observe that our techniques outperform the prior approach by a significant margin (up to 50%). © 2023 IEEE.","","Benchmarking; Timing circuits; 'current; Communication cost; Minimizing the number of; Multiple computers; Performance; Quanta computers; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum network; Sub-circuits; Qubits","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS-2128187, FET-2106447)","This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Award FET-2106447 and Award CNS-2128187.","Martinez P.A., Heunen C., Automated distribution of quantum circuits via hypergraph partitioning, Physical Review A, (2019); Bennett C.H., Brassard G., Crepeau C., Jozsa R., Peres A., Wootters W.K., Teleporting an unknown quantum state via dual classical and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen channels, Phys.

In this paper, we present a landscaping study with a gathered dataset of 441 companies from 42 countries that we identify as quantum start-ups, meaning that they mainly focus on quantum technologies (QT) as their primary priority business. We answer the following questions: (1) What are the temporal and geographical distributions of the quantum start-ups? (2) How can we categorize them, and how are these categories populated? (3) Are there any patterns that we can derive from empirical data on trends? We found that more than 92% of these companies have been founded within the last 10 years, and more than 50% of them are located in the US, the UK, and Canada. We categorized the QT start-ups into six fields: (i) complementary technologies, (ii) quantum computing (hardware), (iii) quantum computing (software/application/simulation), (iv) quantum cryptography/communication, (v) quantum sensing and metrology, and (vi) supporting companies, and analyzed the population of each field both for countries, and temporally. Finally, we argue that low levels of quantum start-up activity in a country might be an indicator of a national initiative to be adopted afterwards, which later sees both an increase in the number of start-ups, and a diversification of activity in different QT fields. © 2022, The Author(s).","Emerging technologies; Landscaping study; Quantum technologies; Start-up ecosystem","Binary alloys; Geographical distribution; Land use; Potassium alloys; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Uranium alloys; Computing hardware; Computing software; Emerging technologies; Empirical data; Landscaping study; Quantum Computing; Quantum technologies; Scientific literature; Software applications; Start-up ecosystem; Ecosystems","","","","","Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, DAAD","We would like to thank Michel Kurek, Amanda Stein, Kelvin Willoughby, Maninder Kaur, and Araceli Venegas-Gomez for insightful discussions and their feedback.

Designing an instrument suite to fly on a satellite requires particular attention to a number of aspects for the instrument hardware, which are inherent to space missions. To arrive at a viable mission and spacecraft design, the science performance requirements and instrument needs have to be analyzed, drivers for the mission design need to be identified and numerical simulations of measurement performance have to be run.

In this study, we observe positive contrast in photoelectrically detected magnetic resonance (PDMR) despite the usually observed negative PDMR contrast. To discuss the sign of the PDMR contrast, we numerically analyze the dynamics of photocarrier generation by NV centers using a seven-level rate model. It is found that the sign of the PDMR contrast depends on the difference in the photocurrent generated from the excited states and the metastable state of NV centers. Furthermore, we demonstrate alternating-current (AC) magnetic field sensing using spin coherence with the PDMR technique using a phase-cycling-based noise-canceling technique to suppress the noise from a fluctuating magnetic environment. We obtained the sensitivity of AC magnetic-field of ∼29nT/√Hz with the PDMR technique.  © 2023 IEEE.","Diamonds; Electron paramagnetic resonance; Photoelectricity; Quantum sensing","Electric impedance measurement; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Excited states; Magnetic fields; Paramagnetic resonance; Photoelectricity; Quantum optics; Spin dynamics; Alternating current; Electrical detection; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Photocarrier generation; Quantum information processing devices; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Resonance technique; Seven-level; Nitrogen","","","","","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (19H02546, JPMXS0118067395); Kyoto University","V.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by MEXT Q-LEAP (No. JPMXS0118067395), KAKENHI (No. 19H02546), and Kyoto University Nano Hub.

This paper introduces cold atom sensors as six-axis inertial sensors from the engineering point of view. In order to highlight the potential of this technology as needed for inertial navigation, a strapdown closed-loop-simulation has been developed. Furthermore, we present an error model for quantum sensors that includes terms such as quantum shot noise and phase noise of the reference laser. Considering this inherent stochastic characteristics, we made also a comparison with other conventional inertial measurement units. The analysis shows that quantum sensors with the same sensitivity as of for static measuring local gravity can determine their position with accuracy of one-meter level even after one hour, while other quantum sensors with less sensitivity exhibit for the same duration an amplitude up to 1 km, similar to conventional sensors. © 2017 IEEE.","","Inertial navigation systems; Interferometry; Stochastic systems; Closed-loop simulations; Cold atom interferometry; Conventional sensors; Inertial measurement unit; Inertial navigations; Mechanical sensors; Quantum technologies; Stochastic characteristic; Shot noise","","","","","Niedersächsisches Vorab","We acknowledge financial support from “Niedersächsisches Vorab” through “Fundamentals of Physics and Metrology (FPM)” initiative within the project “Quantensensorik für die Geodäsie”.","Jekeli C., Navigation error analysis of atom interferometer inertial sensor, Navigation, 52, pp. 1-14, (2005); Yang Y., Tightly Coupled MEMS INS/GPS Integration with INS Aided Receiver Tracking Loops, Calagry, (2008); Giroux R., Landry R.J., Leach B., Gourdeau R., Validation and performance evaluation of a simulink inertial navigation system simulator, Canadian Aeronautics and Space Journal, 49, pp. 149-161, (2003); Jekeli C., Inertial Navigation Systems with Geodetic Applications, (2001); Battelier B., Barrett B., Fouche L., Chichet L., Antoni-Micollier L., Porte H., Napolitano F., Lautier J., Landragin A., Bouyer P., Development of Compact Coldatom Sensors for Inertial Navigation, (2016); Gaaloul N., Hartwig J., Schubert C., Ertmer W., Rasel E.M., Precision interferometry with Bose-Einstein-Condensates, Atom Interferometry, Proceedings of International School of Physics Enrico Fermi, Bd, 188, pp. 657-689; Jekeli C., Cold atom interferometer as inertial measurement unit for precision navigation, Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Institute of Navigation, (2001); Titterton D., Weston J., Strapdown Inertial Navigation Technology Second Edition (Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics) AIAA, (2005); Canuel B., Leduc F., Holleville D., Gauguet A., Fils J., Virdis A., Clairon A., Dimarcq N., Borde C.J., Landragin A., Bouyer P., Six-Axis Inertial Sensor Using Cold-Atom Interferometry, Phys.

They enable the understanding, demonstration, and modeling of numerous useful phenomena, such as high fidelity transfer of quantum states, creation and distribution of entanglement, and creation of resources for measurement-based quantum processing. In this paper, a more complex spin system, a 2D spin network (SN) engineered by applying suitable unitaries to two uncoupled spin chains, is studied. Considering only the single-excitation subspace of the SN, it is demonstrated that the system can be operated as a router, directing information through the SN. It is also shown that it can serve to generate maximally entangled states between two sites. Furthermore, it is illustrated that this SN system can be used as a sensor device able to determine an unknown phase applied to a system spin. A detailed modeling investigation of the effects of static disorder in the system shows that this system is robust against different types of disorder. © 2022 The Authors.

The agency released a request for proposals (RfP) on 30 September, 2006, for the newly created Quantum Sensors Programme (QSP). DARPA's goal is to develop sensing modes which are free from the resolution limitations dictated by classical physics in which only coherent photons at the atomic level can be sensed and measured. The sensor applications of interest are lidar/radar,synthetic aperture lidar/radar, imaging cameras and passive radio frequency sensors. The objective of QSP is to develop practical sensors operating outside of a controlled laboratory environment. DARPA is planning to select one or more proposals to develop a theory and conduct an experiment in 2008 to validate the theory and in Phase II, a downselect will allow successful bidders to develop the sensor further,.","","Control equipment; Optical radar; Photons; Sensors; Synthetic aperture radar; Imaging cameras; Quantum Sensors Programme (QSP); Sensing modes; Quantum theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","02653818","","","","English","Jane's Def.

In the period of 2013–2015, 2455 authors of quantum physics papers came from the EU, compared with 1913 from China and 1564 from North America [5]. Over 50% of academic papers in the field come from European scholars. The European Commission has also supported quantum science heavily over the last 20 years, with a cumulative investment reaching around €550 M [6]. Within Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, the European Commission is already actively supporting QT8. However, both commercialisation of research results and the interest of large industrial players is less developed in Europe than it is, for example, in North America. In the past, Europe has famously failed to capitalise on major technology trends (e.g. digital platforms) and we should not miss the opportunity this time. A strong urgency for Europe to start fast with real focused and consolidated efforts to keep up with QT global developments is felt by many experts and decision makers. This urge was expressed in the Quantum Manifesto9, endorsed by over 3500 stakeholders from a broad community of industries, research institutes and scientists in Europe and published in April 2016. As a reaction to the Manifesto, the European Commission proposed the launch of an ambitious, long-term and large-scale flagship initiative to ensure that Europe stays at the forefront of developments in QT and has a leading role in their future exploitation [7].","Mohseni M., Commercialize quantum technologies in five years, Nature, 543, pp. 171-174, (2017); Gibney E., Chinese satellite is one giant step for the quantum internet, Nature, 535, (2016); Kalbe G., The new Flagship on Quantum Technologies, State of Play, (2016); Zoller P., Et al., Eur.

These technologies that emanated from the Quantum 1.0 Revolution have become ubiquitous in modern civilization over the past 50 years. The product commercialization and mass production were enabled by scientists, researchers, engineers, and most importantly, by the skilled technological workforce. This workforce played a critical support role in transforming inventions into high-volume, marketable products. We are currently at the heart of the Second Quantum Revolution, which is fueled by the research in quantum computing, quantum communication, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing. The scientific progress that is currently taking place in these areas is going to fundamentally change the way we sense the world around us, approach our security, and process critical information. Governments and private entities across the world have recognized the strategic importance of quantum research-enabled technologies and have invested a significant amount of money to support graduate programs and research institutions where scientists, engineers, and other professionals are earning advanced degrees and immediately being engaged in active Quantum 2.0 research. To the best of our knowledge, and despite considerable investment in quantum research, no active efforts or programs exist that would train a quantum technological workforce at the technician level to support Quantum 2.0. The quantum industry, on the other side, has clearly identified the need for highly skilled quantum technicians that are able to support the commercialization of the new products and inventions. The lack of a trained quantum technician workforce is a major shortcoming that may have a profound negative impact on the long-term prospects and sustainability of the emerging quantum industry. The EdQuantum project, funded through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, is an effort to close this shortcoming and propose a well-defined curriculum through which the incumbent photonic and laser technicians in the United States will be upskilled with the new skills and competencies from quantum research-enabled technologies. This paper presents the results of the first phase of the EdQuantum project-the quantum industry survey. Over the last few months, we sought input from the quantum industry as to what skills and competencies should a future quantum technician possess to support its emerging needs. The results collected during the survey are presented in this paper along with their impact on the proposed educational curriculum. This paper also elaborates on the alignment of the proposed curriculum with a few ongoing initiatives in the skilled technical workforce education (such as NSB Vision 2030, Convergence Accelerators Initiative, and Skilled Technical Workforce Initiative).  © The Authors.

However, a spatially-distributed array of such sensors, with each sensor measuring only nm-vibrations, may not provide sufficient sensitivity for the prediction of major earthquakes because it fails to exploit potentially critical phase information. We conjecture that relative phase information can explain the anecdotal observations that animals such as lemurs exhibit sensitivity to impending earthquakes earlier than can be done confidently with traditional seismic technology. More specifically, we propose that lemurs use their limbs as ground motion sensors and that relative phase differences are fused in the brain in a manner similar to a phased-array or synthetic-aperture radar. In this paper we will describe a lemur-inspired quantum sensor network for early warning of earthquakes. The system uses 4 interferometric quantum seismographs (e.g., analogous to a lemurs limbs) and then conducts phase and data fusion of the seismic information. Although we discuss a quantum-based technology, the principles described can also be applied to classical sensor arrays. © 2017 SPIE.","Animal Behavior; Earthquakes; Interferometry; Lemurs; Phased Array Radar; Quantum Information; Quantum Radar; Quantum Sensing; Quantum Sensors; Seismography; Seismology; Synthetic Aperture Radar","Animals; Data fusion; Geophysics; Interferometry; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Radar; Radar equipment; Seismographs; Seismology; Sensor networks; Synthetic aperture radar; Animal behavior; Lemurs; Phased array radars; Quantum Information; Quantum Sensing; Quantum sensors; Seismography; Earthquakes","","","","","","","Lanzagorta M., Et al., Quantum seismography, Proceedings of SPIE, 9829, (2016); Lanzagorta M., Quantum Radar, (2011); Ikeya M., Earthquake and Animals: From Folk Legends to Science, (2004); Tributsch H., When the Snakes Awake, (1982); Schaal R.B., An evolution of the animal-behavior theory for earthquake prediction, California Geology, 41, 2, (1988); Kirschvink J.L., Earthquake prediction by animals: Evolution and sensory perception, Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 90, 2, pp. 321-323, (2000); Freund F., Stolc V., Nature of pre-earthquake phenomena and their efects on living organisms, Animals, 3, (2013); United States Geological Survey, (2011); 24, (2011); Shearer P.M., Introduction to Seismology, (2009); Udias A., Principles of Seismology, (1999); Stein S., Wysession M., An Introduction to Seismology, Earthquakes, and Earth Structure, (2014); Aki K., Richards P.G., Quantitative Seismology, (2002); Burridge R., Knopo L., Model and theoretical seismicity, Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 57, 3; Carlson J.M., Langer J.S., Mechanical model of an earthquake fault, Phys.

To address this problem, we highlight a generalization of the sensor symmetric performance bounds of Rubio, [J. Phys. A 53, 344001 (2020)]1751-811310.1088/1751-8121/ab9d46 and develop an optimized sequential protocol for measuring such functions. We compare the performance of both approaches to one another and to local protocols that do not utilize quantum entanglement, emphasizing the geometric significance of the coefficient vectors of the measured functions in determining the best choice of measurement protocol. We show that, in many cases, especially for a large number of sensors, the optimized sequential protocol results in more accurate measurements than the other strategies. In addition, in contrast to the sensor symmetric approach, the sequential protocol is known to always be explicitly implementable. The sequential protocol is very general and has a wide range of metrological applications. © 2021 authors.

Prior to that, it took the insight of an educator and eminent computer scientist (Umesh Vazirani) to realize that a complete and consistent introduction to QM can be given via the language of qubits and quantum gates. Closer to the present, it took the profound intuition of another polymath (Terry Rudolph) to realize that the linear algebra normally at the foundation of such an approach can be replaced with a simple rewriting system accessible to middle school students. Rewriting systems are at the foundation of Computer Science, they are, in fact, the very fabric of it (e.g., Turing machines and lambda calculus), so these are very fortunate developments. Furthermore, a linear algebra prerequisite is now shared firmly in the CS undergraduate curriculum with Machine Learning, a topic that has known a very deep and sudden revival. Quantum Information Science and Technology (QIST) is inherently interdisciplinary and spans physics, computer science, mathematics, engineering, chemistry and materials science. We present three curricular plans for incorporating QIST topics (via Quantum Computing) into the CS undergraduate curriculum. Such plans have been constructed with a preliminary consultation with QED-C members (industry, academia, national labs, and government agencies) asking for comments, suggestions and general input on these three curricular plans. © 2023 ACM.","quantum architectures; quantum computation; quantum information science; quantum processing unit; undergraduate curriculum","Application programs; Computer architecture; Curricula; Differentiation (calculus); Engineering education; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Relativity; Turing machines; Design and implementations; Knowledge units; Processing units; Quantum architecture; Quantum information science; Quantum information technologies; Quantum processing unit; Rewriting systems; Science and Technology; Undergraduate curricula; Linear algebra","","","","","","","Aaronson S., Quantum Mechanics since Democritus, (2013); Asfaw A., Blais A., Brown K.R., Candelaria J., Cantwell C., Carr L.D., Combes J., Debroy D.M., Donohue J.M., Economou S.E., Edwards E., Michael F.J.F., Girvin S.M., Ho A., Hurst H.M., Jacob Z., Johnson B.R., Johnston-Halperin E., Joynt R., Kapit E., Klein-Seetharaman J., Laforest M., Lewandowski H.J., Lynn T.W., Corey R.H.M., Merzbacher C., Michalakis S., Narang P., Oliver W.D., Palsberg J., Pappas D.P., Raymer M.G., Reilly D.J., Saffman M., Searles T.A., Shapiro J.H., Singh C., Building a Quantum Engineering Undergraduate Program, IEEE Trans.

Canopy LI is often measured with linear quantum sensors, but the need for unobstructed sunlight near solar noon can make field measurements impractical. We aimed to evaluate the use of the fraction of green canopy cover (FGCC) as a surrogate for LI in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) canopies. A linear quantum sensor and a camera were used to collect 930 observations during the 2021 growing season across three locations in Kansas. Images were analyzed with the Canopeo application. The quantum sensor was also used to estimate the LI and leaf area index (LAI) in different canopy strata. Growing season shoot dry biomass was modeled with LI values from images and the quantum sensor. The LI estimated by the quantum sensor and images resulted in a strong positive linear correlation (r = 0.97). During the vegetative stages, LI values from images were generally greater than the LI values from the quantum sensor. During the reproductive stages, LI values from images were generally lower than those obtained by the quantum sensor, which was partly attributed to the better discrimination of FGCC for senescing vegetation. Using images to measure LI was easier and faster in prostrate canopies, and less sensitive to soil microrelief and changing sky conditions. The quantum sensor was useful for quantifying LI and LAI nondestructively in different canopy layers. Final growing season shoot dry biomass determined by either method was within 5% of the observed biomass. © 2022 The Authors.

However, the use of quantum technology in wireless sensor networks has not been thoroughly investigated just yet. This is in part due to the complexity of using big, costly, and highly energy-consuming machines that are quantum computers to this date, compared to the nodes used in wireless sensor networks which are small, inexpensive, and operate with very low energy consumption requirements. However, we can expect that in the future (possibly in the next decade) quantum computers will be commercial and reduced in size, and hence, they can be used for sensor network applications which are the basis of the Internet of Things. In this review, we study the road from quantum computing to quantum wireless sensor networks and how the analysis and design of these systems have to change to accommodate quantum capabilities in sensors, processors, communication links, and overall performance of these monitoring networks. © The Author(s) 2021.","quantum communications;

The tools for the effective implementation of the challenges related to the start, we hope, of building a quantum civilization are both common and individual in particular European countries. Joint projects in the field of QIT, usually narrowly focused, are announced by large European Agencies and are related to their activities. Large-scale collaborative projects are of course the domain of the EC. National projects depend heavily on the capabilities of individual countries and vary greatly in size. The most technologically advanced European countries invest hundreds of millions of Euros in national QIT projects annually. The largest European FET class project currently being implemented is the Quantum Flagship. Although the EQF is basically just one of the elements of a large and complicated European scene of development of quantum technologies, it becomes the most important element and, in a sense, a dominant one, also supported from the political level. There are complex connections and feedbacks between the elements of this quantum scene. National projects try to link to the EQF. Here we are interested in such connections and their impact on the effectiveness of QIT development in Europe, and especially in Poland. © 2023 Polish Academy of Sciences.

Quantum sensors can for instance be afflicted with erasure errors. Here, we consider using quantum probe states with a structure that corresponds to classical [n,k,d] binary block codes of minimum distance d≥t+1. We obtain bounds on the ultimate precision that these probe states can give for estimating the unknown magnitude of a classical field after at most t qubits of the quantum probe state are erased. We show that the quantum Fisher information is proportional to the variances of the weight distributions of the corresponding 2t shortened codes. If the shortened codes of a fixed code with d≥t+1 have a nontrivial weight distribution, then the probe states obtained by concatenating this code with repetition codes of increasing length enable asymptotically optimal field sensing that passively tolerates up to t erasure errors.  © 2023 American Physical Society.","","Codes (symbols); Errors; Fisher information matrix; Optimal systems; Quantum noise; Quantum theory; Binary block codes; Classical fields; Erasure error; Minimums distance; Performance; Quantum metrology; Quantum probe; Quantum sensors; Quantum technologies; Weight distributions; Probes","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1718494, 1908730); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/M024261/1, EP/R043825/1); National University of Singapore, NUS, (R-263-000-E32-133, R-263-000-E32-731); National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE","Y.O. acknowledges support from EPSRC (Grant No. EP/M024261/1) and the QCDA project (Grant No. EP/R043825/1) which has received funding from the QuantERA ERANET Cofund in Quantum Technologies implemented within the European Union's Horizon 2020 Programme.

This technology provides a cost effective alternative for applications that demand high detector sensitivity and image quality. High Quanta sensors are fabricated on a p substrate and potentially can be back-side-thinned as well. This provides an option to camera designers to reuse the same platform for both types of sensors and easy future upgrades for end users. Cost-effective, high performance imaging detectors play a significant role in expanding the quantum efficiency of sensors and reduces the gap between back-sided-thinned and front-illuminated CCDs. Imaging dye-labeled cells using a CCD camera is an example of a scientific imaging application that can benefit from CCDs with higher quantum efficiency.","","Cameras; Charge coupled devices; Cost effectiveness; Detectors; Digital cameras; Image quality; Modernization; Optical design; Semiconductor quantum dots; Sensors; (algorithmic) complexity; (OTDR) technology; Bridging methods; Detector sensitivity; End users; High performance imaging; Illuminated CCD; Labeled cells; life sciences; OF sensors; P substrate; Scientific imaging; Quantum efficiency","","","","","","","","B.

A variety of gravity measurements have been made through the CHAMP mission, for example, that use accurate tracking of the motion of spacecraft to measure gravitational fields. Quantum gravity gradiometers based on atom interferometry have emerged as a result of the recent advent of laser cooling and manipulation of atoms. The quantum gravity gradiometer, unlike other inertial sensors, uses atoms as test masses that are unaffected by drag. The wavelike characteristic of atoms (from modern developments in the first quantization of quantum mechanics) is used to quantify local accelerations using interferometry. Cold atom-wave interferometers have previously shown outstanding sensitivity in acceleration and rotation as well, allowing for precise determination of movement in space. This will be useful in gathering information about celestial bodies' natures. The use of quantum sensors, more specifically Quantum-based Gravimeters, will lead to more accurate measurements of gravitational fields in comparison to classical sensors. This has uses in telescopes and satellites, and space probes, with the potential to increase accuracy and precision in a variety of measurements across the space industry. The increase in accuracy through the use of these sensors has been found to be up to 100,000,000 times more sensitive than classical sensors. Quantum sensors in space will be able to determine the density and seismic status and change of the global environment, climate, and bodies in space that may be of significance to space missions through the use of Quantum Interferometry. Global needs for quantum sensors consist of climate change, seismic scanning for earthquakes, and density analysis for future explorations to other planets or celestial bodies. Ways to implement such technology require optimization of fundamental parameters. © 2022 International Astronautical Federation, IAF.

The consequent challenges for future cyber security and strategy require a nuanced analysis of these technologies and their likely employment by major powers. The employment of quantum cryptography can create quantum communications systems that are theoretically unhackable. Within the foreseeable future, quantum computing will be powerful enough to overcome most of today's advanced encryption techniques, rendering the majority of existing commercial, government, and military systems unprecedentedly vulnerable. These quantum technologies could respectively tend to advantage defense and offense in the cyber domain. While the 'shield' enabled by quantum communications would contribute to technological deterrence through denial, the asymmetries of vulnerability that might result could potentially undermine military cyber stability, while exacerbating the risks of misperception through complicating intelligence collection. In the more distant future, the advent of quantum computing will enable unique offensive power that could leapfrog existing cyber capabilities. The strategic impact of these disruptive technologies will depend upon the approaches of great powers, particularly the U.S. and China, which have become leaders in this technological domain. © 2017 IEEE.","cyber stability; quantum communications; quantum computing; technological deterrence","Distributed computer systems; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Disruptive technology; Distant futures; Encryption technique; Military systems; Quantum Computing; Quantum technologies; Strategic impacts; technological deterrence; Quantum communication","","","","","China’s National High-Technology Research and Development Plan or “863 Plan; National Key Basic Research and Development Plan or “973 Plan”; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA","Funding text 1: Traditionally, China’s national research and development plans for science and technology have translated this high-level focus on quantum technologies into action through funding basic and applied research in this domain. In 2001, the Key Laboratory of Quantum Information was established under the aegis of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, located at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and Pan was also involved in the formation of USTC’s Quantum Information Laboratory. Their research has been largely enabled through sources of funding including China’s National High-Technology Research and Development Plan or “863 Plan” and the former National Key Basic Research and Development Plan or “973 Plan” [30]. Their experimental successes in the early 2000s accelerated interest and funding for their ambitious research agenda. By the late 2000s, China had achieved a considerable advances in quantum communications and computing.; Funding text 2: The U.S. has traditionally been at the forefront of advances in quantum information science. The world’s first quantum key distribution network became operational in Cambridge, MA in October 2003, based on the work of BBN’s laboratories, which was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [10]. DARPA has included quantum science among its “core strategic thrusts” since the mid-2000s [11]. Through the Quantum Entanglement Science and Technology (QuEST) program, established in 2008, DARPA has sought to fund advances in multiple quantum technologies [12]. As of 2015, DARPA has also recognized efforts to harness the power of quantum physics as among its prioritized “breakthrough technologies for national security” [13].

The PAR quantum sensors, which measure the photon flux of radiation in the spectral interval 400nm-700nm, can't measure the several intervals which are used in plant lighting simultaneously, but the LED plant factory needs these data and their ratios by far, a type of multi-channel quantum sensor is designed to solve this problem. Firstly, the paper expounds the design principle, circuit and structure of the sensor, and calibrate the unregulated sensors by the PQS-1 sensor under the calibration device constructed by controller based on DMX512 protocol. The test results show that the sensor has good linear response, whose average R2 is 0.9956. The article finally designs a set of light environment control system, which can auto control the photon fluxes and light quality ratios, based on the sensors. © 2018 SPIE.","calibration; light environment control; Multi-channel; PAR sensor; plant factory","Agriculture; Calibration; Light emitting diodes; Photons; Plant life extension; Urban growth; Design and application; Design Principles; Light environment; Linear response; Measurement of plant growths; Multi channel; Plant factory; Urban agricultures; Quality control","","","","","","","[Photosynthetically Active Radiation] Physiological Plant Ecology i, pp. 41-55, (1981); McCree K.J., [Agricultural Meteorology A Solar Meter for Measuring Photosynthetically Active Radiation], 3, 5-6, pp. 353-366, (1966); [Photosynthesis and Related Processes], (1951); Barnes C., Et al., Accuracy of quantum sensors measuring yield photon flux and photosynthetic photon flux, Hortscience A Publication of the American Society for Horticultural Science, 28, 12, (1993); Ross J., Sulev M., Sources of errors in measurements of PAR, Agricultural & Forest Meteorology, 100, 2, pp. 103-125, (2000); LI-190R Quantum Sensor, (2018); PQS1 PAR Quantum Sensor, (2018); Toyoki K., Niu G., [Plant factory as a resource-efficient closed plant production system], Plant Factory, pp. 69-90, (2016); Massa Gioia D., Et al., Plant productivity in response to led lighting, Hortscience, 43, 7, pp. 1951-1956, (2008); Tazawa S., Effects of various radiant sources on plant growth, Jarq-Japan Agricultural Research Quarterly, 33, pp. 163-176, (1999); Son K.H., Oh M.M., Leaf shape, growth, antioxidant phenolic compounds of two lettuce cultivars grown under various combinations of blue and red light-emitting diodes, Hortscience A Publication of the American Society for Horticultural Science, 48, 8, pp. 988-995, (2013); Myoung Jun J., Et al., Effect of color of light emitting diode on development of fruit body in hypsizygus marmoreus, Mycobiology, 41, 1, pp. 63-66, (2013); Samuolien G., Et al., Effect of Supplementary Led Lighting on the Antioxidant and Nutritional Properties of Lettuce, Acta Horticulturae, 952, 3, pp. 835-841, (2012); Johkan M., Et al., Blue light-emitting diode light irradiation of seedlings improves seedling quality and growth after transplanting in red leaf lettuce, Hortscience A Publication of the American Society for Horticultural Science, 45, 12, pp. 414-415, (2010); Wanlai Z., Wenke L., Qichang Y., Reducing nitrate content in lettuce by pre-harvest continuous light delivered by red and blue light-emitting diodes, Journal of Plant Nutrition, 36, 3, pp. 481-490, (2013); Hisatake O., Taniguchi T., Band-pass Filter, (1991); Zheng R., Et al., Cosine error correction of solar radiation observation instrument, Acta Photonica Sinica, 34, 9, pp. 2578-2581, (2016)","","Liu T.; Jiang S.","SPIE","COS - Chinese Optical Society; The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Advanced Sensor Systems and Applications VIII 2018","11 October 2018 through 13 October 2018","Beijing","142031","0277786X","978-151062240-1","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057147369"

However, their integration into compact systems is still an active area of research. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a quantum magnetometer based on negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers using a custom-designed, chip-integrated 4-way transmitter. In combination with a custom-designed microcoil array, the 4-way transmitter delivers microwave magnetic fields up to 226 μT for carrier frequencies around 7 GHz with a conversion gain of ≥32 dB to NV centers. The local oscillator (LO) signal required to drive the on-chip quadrature upconversion mixer is generated by a custom-designed quadrature PLL, which provides a 22% tuning range between 6.4 and 8 GHz, and a low phase noise of -122 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset from a 7 GHz carrier, to enable broadband, low-noise magnetometry. To verify the excellent performance of the integrated electronics, we have embedded them into a widefield diamond magnetometer using off-chip scanning optics, achieving a state-of-the-art AC-magnetic field limit of detection of 300 pT/Hz1/2. © 2023 IEEE.","NV centers; ODMR; power amplifier; quantum magnetometer; RF transmitter; SiGe BiCMOS","BiCMOS technology; Bismuth alloys; Diamonds; Magnetic fields; Magnetometers; Quantum theory; Si-Ge alloys; Calibration free; Colour centers; High sensitivity; Nitrogen-vacancy center; ODMR; Quantum magnetometer; Quantum sensors; RF transmitter; Room temperature properties; Sige BiCMOS; Power amplifiers","","","","","","","Rondin L., Et al., Magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond, Rep.

This method does not require the use of artificially created magnetic fields; a scheme of an all-optical quantum sensor based on this method has been experimentally tested. The proposed method does not involve the use of radiofrequency field, since it is based on measuring the polarization properties of an oriented paramagnetic medium and does not use the phenomenon of magnetic resonance. However, the inclusion of a resonant radiofrequency field into the proposed scheme allows the information about the angle of the magnetic field vector to be supplemented with information about its module. The proposed method maintains operability and provides the same angular sensitivity of the order of tens of angular milliseconds in a wide range of magnetic fields, from hundreds of nT to hundreds of µT and above. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","magnetic field measurement; optical quantum sensor; polarization rotation","Magnetic fields; Magnetic resonance; Polarization; All optical; Angular sensitivity; Magnetic field vectors; Polarization properties; Polarization rotation; Precise measurements; Quantum sensors; Radio-frequency fields; Magnetic field measurement","","","","","","","Prouty M.D., Johnson R., Hrvoic I., Vershovskiy A.K., Optical Magnetometry, (2013); Boto E., Holmes N., Leggett J., Roberts G., Shah V., Meyer S.S., Munoz L.D., Mullinger K.J., Tierney T.M., Bestmann S., Barnes G.R., Bowtell R., Brookes M.J., Nature (London, U.K.), 555, (2018); Allred J.C., Lyman R.N., Kornack T.W., Romalis M.V., Phys.

However, the challenges in fabricating photonic devices in diamond have limited its potential for use in quantum technologies. While various hybrid integration approaches have been developed for coupling diamond color centers with photonic devices defined in a heterogeneous material, these methods suffer from either large insertion loss at the material interface or evanescent light-matter coupling. Here, we present a new technique that enables the deterministic assembly of diamond color centers in a silicon nitride photonic circuit. Using this technique, we observe Purcell enhancement of silicon vacancy centers coupled to a silicon nitride ring resonator. Our hybrid integration approach has the potential for achieving the maximum possible light-matter interaction strength while maintaining low insertion loss and paves the way toward scalable manufacturing of large-scale quantum photonic circuits integrated with high-quality quantum emitters and spins.","Integrated Photonics; Quantum Optics; Solid-State Quantum Emitters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15306992","","","37782048","English","Nano Lett","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175220125"

For quantum sensors, a basic capability is to uniquely infer unknown parameters in a system based on measurement data from the sensors. In this paper, we investigate the capability of a class of quantum sensors for a spin-12 chain system with unknown parameters. The sensors are composed of qubits which are coupled to the object system and can be initialized and measured. We consider the capability of the single- and two-qubit sensors and show that the capability of single-qubit quantum sensors can be enhanced by adding an extra qubit into the sensor under a certain initialization and measurement setting.

A central part of the high vacuum chamber is the maintenance of vacuum conditions. For this purpose, a prototype of a compact, i.e., miniaturized, ultrahigh vacuum pump in the form of a nonevaporable getter (NEG) pump at a wafer level (MEMS), is developed within the scope of this work. With regard to the basic conditions of the functionality of the NEG, a miniaturized heating plate with temperature sensors is analytically and numerically developed, constructed, and characterized in an ultrahigh vacuum test stand. This is followed by the integration of the NEG into the existing system, which, in connection with the characterization of material-specific parameters, enables a first correlation of heat input and pumping power. Thus, performance data of the getter-MEMS under high-vacuum confinement confirm its usability for quantum sensors. In addition, optimization potentials are shown with regard to all partial aspects of the MEMS.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Getters; Ultrahigh vacuum; Condition; Control electronics; High-vacuum chambers; Industrial use; Laser control; Laser technologies; Miniaturisation; Non-evaporable getters; Quantum sensors; Vacuum condition; Vacuum pumps","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (EXC-2123 QuantumFrontiers— 390837967)","This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschung sgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy—EXC-2123 QuantumFrontiers— 390837967.

This is achieved after training the network with a collection of known inputs and results leading to an adjustment of the neuron connections and biases. In the context of quantum detection schemes, NNs find a natural playground. In particular, in the presence of a target (e.g. an electromagnetic field), a quantum sensor delivers a response, i.e. the input data, which can be subsequently processed by a NN that outputs the target features. In this work we demonstrate that adequately trained NNs enable to characterize a target with (i) minimal knowledge of the underlying physical model (ii) in regimes where the quantum sensor presents complex responses and (iii) under a significant shot noise due to a reduced number of measurements. We exemplify the method with a development for 171Yb+ atomic sensors. However, our protocol is general, thus applicable to arbitrary quantum detection scenarios. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Atomic-size quantum sensor; Neural network; Quantum detection; Quantum magnetometry; Quantum parameter estimation","Electromagnetic fields; Input output programs; Shot noise; Atomic sensors; Complex response; Input datas; Physical model; Quantum detection; Quantum sensors; Target feature; Neural networks","","","","","SFI-DfE, (15/IA/2864, EUR2020-112117, RYC2018-025197-I); Spanish Government, (PGC2018-095113-B-I00); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (820363, 820505, 828826); Eusko Jaurlaritza, (IT986-16); Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, EHU; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN","We acknowledge financial support from Spanish Government via PGC2018-095113-B-I00 (MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE), Basque Government via IT986-16, as well as from QMiCS (820505) and OpenSuperQ (820363) of the EU Flagship on Quantum Technologies, and the EU FET Open Grant Quromorphic (828826).

At the same time, advances in manipulating classical light--primarily in the form of linear optical elements built from photonics devices--suggest a unique opportunity to connect quantum science to emerging technological platforms. I will discuss recent advances towards implementation of nonlinear photonic devices for quantum information processing and quantum simulation of topological phases of matter. In the first, we consider a novel approach for manipulating microwave photons in high quality factor superconducting resonators by creating an effective nonlinear medium with Josephson devices. Using some of the same ideas, I will then consider implementation of a quantum simulator for topological states of matter using light. These states, such as those expected in the fractional Quantum Hall regime, provide the potential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. © OSA 2012.","","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Light; Microwave resonators; Photons; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum Hall effect; Quantum optics; Superconducting devices; Superconducting resonators; Topology; Fault-tolerant quantum computing; High quality factors; Linear optical elements; Nonlinear photonic devices; Quantum Hall regime; Quantum simulations; Quantum-information processing; Technological platform; Photonic devices","","","","","","","","","","Optical Society of America (OSA)","","Laser Science, LS 2012","14 October 2012 through 18 October 2012","Rochester, NY","102373","","978-155752956-5","","","English","Laser Sci.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088344783"

Within our work on compact atomic sensors, we develop miniaturized, ultra-stable optical setups for optical cooling and trapping of cold atomic gases on atom chips. Besides challenging demands on alignment precision and thermo-mechanical durability, we specifically address ultra-high vacuum (UHV) compatibility of our adhesive integration technology and the assembled optical components. A prototype of an UHV-compatible, crossed beam optical dipole trap at 1064 nm for application within a cold rubidium atomic quantum sensor currently in development at the Joint Lab Integrated Quantum Sensors at Ferdinand-Braun-Institut, Leibniz-Institut für Höchstfrequenztechnik is described. We describe the design and first qualification efforts on adhesive micro-integration technologies. These tests are conducted in application-relevant geometries and material combinations common for micro-integrated optical setups. Adhesive aging will be investigated by thermal cycling and radiation exposure. For vacuum compatibility testing, a versatile UHV testing system for samples up to 65×65mm2 footprint is currently being set up, enabling residual gas analysis, temperature cycling up to 200∘C and measurement of total gas rates down to expected 5×10-10mbarl/s at a base pressure of 10-11mbar, exceeding the common ASTM E595 test. © 2019, CEAS.","Adhesive bonding; Integrated quantum sensors; Microintegration; Microoptics; Optical dipole trap; UHV qualification","Adhesives; Atoms; C (programming language); Integration; Microoptics; Software prototyping; Ultrahigh vacuum; Adhesive bonding; Microintegration; Optical dipole traps; Quantum sensors; UHV qualification; Photonic integration technology","","","","","German Space Agency DLR; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (691156); Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi, (DLR 50WM1648-50)","This work is supported by the German Space Agency DLR with funds provided by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy under Grant numbers DLR 50WM1648-50.","Oi D.K.L., Et al., Nanosatellites for quantum science and technology, Contemp.

In contrast, quantum radar theory states that sidelobe structures on quantum radar cross section graphs are due to quantum interference. Moreover, it is conjectured that quantum sidelobe structures may be used to detect targets oriented off the specular direction. Because of the high data bandwidth expected from quantum radar, it may be necessary to use sophisticated quantum signal analysis algorithms to determine the presence of stealth targets through the sidelobe structures. In this paper we introduce three potential quantum algorithmic techniques to compute classical and quantum radar cross sections. It is our purpose to develop a computer science-oriented tool for further physical analysis of quantum radar models as well as applications of quantum radar technology in various fields. © 2015 SPIE.","D-Wave; Quantum Annealing; Quantum Information; Quantum Radar; Quantum Sensing; Quantum Sensors; Radar Cross Sections; Stealth Sensing","Algorithms; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Radar; Radar equipment; Radar theory; Quantum annealing; Quantum Information; Quantum Sensing; Quantum sensors; Stealth Sensing; Radar cross section","","","","","Rochester Academy of Science, RAS; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT, (41594); Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, ITESM","SEVA would like to thank his family for their support as well as to gratefully acknowledge the financial support of Tecnológico de Monterrey - Escuela de Ciencias e Ingeniería, CONACyT (SNI member number 41594), and RAS project on: ""Modeling the uncertainty: quantum theory and imaging processing"", LR 7/8/2007.","Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2000); Lanzagorta M., Uhlmann J., Quantum Computer Science, (2009); Shapiro J.H., Quantum pulse compression laser radar, Proceedings of SPIE, 6603, (2007); Didomenico L.D., Lee H., Kok P., Dowling J.P., Quantum interferometric sensors, Proceedings of SPIE Quantum Sensing and Nanophotonic Devices, (2004); Dowling J.P., Quantum optical metrology - The lowdown on high-NOON states, Contemporary Physics, 49, 2, (2008); Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Quantum enhanced positioning and clock synchronization, Nature, 412, (2001); Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Quantum-enhanced measurements: Beating the standard quantum limit, Science, 306, (2004); Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Quantum metrology, Phys.

The challenge of reaching the maximum accuracy, building more powerful devices, can be done only using quantum effects [1]. The field that studies how to improve the sensitivity of measurements is Quantum Metrology. Quantum metrology techniques have been extensively adopted to perform static measurements in many scenarios, showing that multi-photon entangled states, may achieve the ultimate bound on sensitivity. © 2019 IEEE","","Chemical process; High-precision measurement; Maximum accuracies; Optical-; Powerful devices; Quantum effects; Quantum metrology; Quantum sensors; Static measurements; Technological applications; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Quantum-enhanced measurements: Beating the standard quantum limit, Science, 306, (2004); Szczykulska M., Baumgratz T., Datta A., Multi-parameter quantum metrology, Adv.

The qubit associated with the NV centre ground state spin has been the key element for the realisation of such applications. Its coherence time determines the application performances, e.g. the sensitivity of the NV-qubit based quantum sensor. Due to unwanted and unavoidable interactions with noisy environment, the qubit undergoes decoherence that shortens its coherence time and hence reduces its application performance. Therefore, the investigation and mitigation of the decoherence of the NV qubit are of the utmost importance. Here, we simulate the qubit decoherence using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that is essential for designing a set of modulating control pulses to mitigate the effect. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Magnetic resonance; Nitrogen; Optical properties; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Application performance; Coherence time; Decoherence; Ground-state spins; Key elements; Microwave field; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process; Spin qubit; Ground state","","","","","","","Rieger P, Electron Spin Resonance The Royal Society of Chemistry, (2007); Kuzmany H, Solid-State Spectroscopy : An Introduction, (1998); Schwart I, Rosskopf J, Schmitt S, Tratzmiller B, Chen Q, McGuiness L P., Jelezko F, Plenio M B., Scientific Reports, 9, (2019); Doherty M W., Dolde F, Fedder H, Jelezko F, Wratchrup J, Manson N B., Hollenberg L C.

Nowadays, several systems such as optical clocks or gravitational wave detectors approach measurement sensitivities where this limitation poses a major contribution to the total statistical uncertainty. It is known that this limit can be overcome by preparing the probe in a non-classical state. We will give an overview over the different non-classical states that have been implemented in the motion of single trapped ions and discuss their individual advantages and limitations in metrology. Possible applications for the presented experiments are the measurement of small oscillating electric fields and trapping frequencies. The Focus will be on our experimental work on Fock states, where quantum-enhanced sensing in both scenarios is possible with the same quantum state. © 2021","","Electric fields; Gravity waves; Quantum noise; Quantum optics; Systematic errors; Trapped ions; Uncertainty analysis; Clock waves; Fundamental limitations; Gravitational waves detectors; Measurement sensitivity; Noise limit; Optical clocks; Quantum sensors; Single trapped ion; Statistical uncertainty; Trapped ion; Shot noise","","","","","State of Lower-Saxony; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (390837967, 434617780 – SFB 1227, B05)","We acknowledge support from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy – EXC-2123 Quantum Frontiers – 390837967 and Project-ID 434617780 – SFB 1227 (DQ-mat, project B05).

With an increasing number of satellites in low-Earth orbit, accurate observations of the atmospheric mass density are required to improve models of the thermosphere with applications in satellite lifetime predictions, collision risk assessment and avoidance. We are developing a compact cold atom accelerometer for atmospheric density missions, to be launched in mid to late 2020s. These quantum sensors are based on atom interferometry. A cold atom sample is generated using the combination of an atom-chip and resonant laser beams. The cold atom cloud is then diffracted using a set of three laser pulses, generating a matter-wave interferometer. The phase-shift at the output of the interferometer is proportional to the acceleration of the free falling atoms with respect to the satellite, which is converted to density observations. Teledyne e2v is producing a space suitable accelerometer physics package that can be embedded in small satellites such as a 16U cubesat or a SkimSat. It includes an atom-chip for producing magnetic fields local to the atoms in vacuum developed by RAL Space. It will address some of the engineering challenges associated with the launch and the required low SWAP and will be integrated into a breadboard system capable of acceleration measurement in order to test interferometry schemes suitable for measurements in micro-gravity. Atmospheric drag measurement can be the world's first cold atom Earth observation mission and be a pathfinder for a future large-scale cold atom gravity mission. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

This level of integration can only be obtained by a revolutionary approach to avoiding the scaling limits of conventional integrated circuits (ICs). Nanoelectronics is an emerging IC technology that will exploit quantum electronic effects in nanometer-sized heterojunction devices to enable single chip image pnxcssing systems consisting of millions of sensor-processor elements. In a quantum image processor, each sensor will be integrated with a high performance signal processor to provide a chip-Jevel throughput that approaches 1 million TeraOps. litis paper discusses the thermodynamic and other physical limits to developing monolithic, quantum sensor processors and summarizes the processor architecture, device and circuit concepts that are in development. © 1993 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

PAR sensors are an important tool for farmers and the proposed solution offers a path to low-cost PAR sensors. A technique for correcting the optical spectral leakage in the spectral sensor chipset is proposed and is applied to measurements collected indoors and outdoors.

It harnesses the law of quantum mechanics that aids in solving highly complex problems. The law incorporates the concept of superposition and entanglement, which are the primary properties of quantum. The qubits are those involved in quantum, with the feasibility that a bit can represent any of the two states, unlike classical computers. With the advent of the new technology, it is important to enhance the other units that support in building up the technology of the future. This chapter proposes the different aspects involved in quantum computing, such as quantum sensors, the processing of quantum, the networks established, etc. It also emphasizes on the importance of moving from the classical computers to quantum, with comparisons. The focus is on knowing that there is the possibility of quantum computing in solving problems that cannot be solved in polynomial time. All these aid in uplifting the classic computing power to quantum. As it is understood that this technology is still in the research stage, the chapter provides information on what it is to actually build a quantum system. Having a brief idea on the different units, it also identifies the different applications of quantum with a few case studies. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

Despite its proven efficiency, only a few proof-of-principle demonstrations have been reported. Here we utilize QFT to enhance the performance of a quantum sensor. We implement the QFT algorithm in a hybrid quantum register consisting of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electron spin and three nuclear spins. The QFT runs on the nuclear spins and serves to process the sensor—i.e., the NV electron spin signal. Specifically, we show the application of QFT for correlation spectroscopy, where the long correlation time benefits the use of the QFT in gaining maximum precision and dynamic range at the same time. We further point out the ability for demultiplexing the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals using QFT and demonstrate precision scaling with the number of used qubits. Our results mark the application of a complex quantum algorithm in sensing which is of particular interest for high dynamic range quantum sensing and nanoscale NMR spectroscopy experiments. © 2021, The Author(s).","","Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Electrospinning; Magnetic moments; Nanotechnology; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Quantum theory; Spin dynamics; Correlation spectroscopy; Fourier transformations; High dynamic range; Nitrogen vacancies; Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR); Proof of principles; Quantum algorithms; Quantum fourier transforms; Fourier transforms","","","","","ASTERIQS; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (742610); European Research Council, ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (FOR2724, SPP1601); Volkswagen Foundation; Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, MPG","We acknowledge financial support by the German Science Foundation (the DFG) via SPP1601, FOR2724, the European Research Council (ASTERIQS, SMel, ERC grant 742610), the Max Planck Society, the Volkswagen Stiftung.","Degen C.L., Reinhard F., Cappellaro P., Quantum sensing, Rev.

In this experiment we use ultracold 87Rb atoms in a differential measurement scheme for extremely precise sensing of rotations and accelerations. As a longterm goal the combination of coherent atomic sources with high resolution atom interferometry could lead to even better accuracies, especially when profiting from low-noise environments like microgravity.

Therefore, PAR observation sites are globally distributed, particularly in flux observation sites. Quantum sensors have been used for half a century to observe PAR; however, their accuracy is still uncertain. This study evaluates the accuracies of nine quantum sensor products by examining their spectral and cosine responses. On the basis of these data as well as reference spectrum data provided by our standard spectrometric measurement, we performed the following analyses: (1) a simulation of errors caused by the sensors’ non-ideal spectral response in three types of radiation inputs (open sky, forest canopy transmission, and forest canopy reflection), (2) a simulation of the errors caused by a complex combination of the sensors’ non-ideal spectral and cosine responses in three diurnal variation types of incident radiation (clear sky, partial clouds, and an overcast sky), and (3) an observation of the sensors’ long-term sensitivity degradation outdoors. Based on the results, we recommend two quantum sensors with minimal errors, LI-COR LI-190 encased in a weather-proof external housing with a glass dome and PREDE PAR-02D. The findings of this study contribute in establishing a long-term PAR observation protocol and should become a basis for quality checks and controls of PAR observation values that have previously been obtained worldwide. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cosine error; Long-term sensitivity degradation; Quantum sensor; Reference standard; Spectral error; Spectral radiation","accuracy assessment; degradation; diurnal variation; error analysis; performance assessment; photosynthesis; photosynthetically active radiation; quantitative analysis; sensitivity analysis; sensor; solar radiation; visible spectrum","","","","","","","Akitsu T., Kume A., Hirose Y., Ijima O., Nasahara K.N., On the stability of radiometric ratios of photosynthetically active radiation to global solar radiation in Tsukuba, Japan, Agric.

Today, a second quantum revolution is underway, leveraging the quantum principles of superposition, entanglement and measurement, which were not fully exploited yet. International innovation activities and standardization bodies have identified four main application areas for quantum technologies and services: quantum secure communications, quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum sensing and metrology. This paper focuses on quantum secure communications by addressing the evolution of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks (under early exploitation today) towards the Quantum-ready networks and the Quantum Internet based also on entanglement distribution. Assuming that management and control of quantum nodes is a key challenge under definition, today, a main obstacle in exploiting long-range QKD and Quantum-ready networks concerns the inherent losses due to the optical transmission channels. Currently, it is assumed that a most promising way for overcoming this limitation, while avoiding the presence of costly trusted nodes, it is to distribute entangled states by means of Quantum Repeaters. In this respect, the paper provides an overview of current methods and systems for end-to-end entanglement generation, with some simulations and a discussion of capacity upper bounds and their impact of secret key rate in QKD systems. © 2022 by the authors.","entanglement; quantum communications; Quantum Key Distribution; Quantum Repeaters","","","","","","","","Pederzolli F., Faticanti F., Siracusa D., Optimal Design of Practical Quantum Key Distribution Backbones for Securing CoreTransport Networks, Quantum Rep, 2, pp. 114-125, (2020); Bacco D., Vagniluca I., Da Lio B., Biagi N., Della Frera A., Calonico D., Toninelli C., Cataliotti F.S., Bellini M., Oxenlowe L.K., Et al., Field trial of a three-state quantum key distribution scheme in the Florence metropolitan area, EPJ Quantum Technol, 6, (2019); Honjo T., Nam S.W., Takesue H., Zhang Q., Kamada H., Nishida Y., Tadanaga O., Asobe M., Baek B., Hadfield R., Et al., Long-distance entanglement-based quantum key distribution over optical fiber, Opt.

Our implementation of the quantum encryption QPP algorithm uses 2-qubit permutation operators created from the compositions of a few CNOT and NOT gates. With inability to physically transfer qubits between two IBMQ machines we acted as two separate IBMQ computers and described how ideally two quantum systems can securely communicate using QPP. Since the physical qubits are still noisy, we use a simple error correction technique by choosing the correct state with the highest probability. Our implementation can be extended to a hybrid system that consist of a quantum computer communicating with a classical computer securely using QPP. This work can be considered as a toy example of the fully secure implementation of quantum encryption using QPP. Nevertheless, it is a promising first step towards secure quantum communication. © 2022 IEEE.","IBMQ; Qiskit; QPP; quantum communication; quantum decryption; quantum encryption; quantum security; secure communication","Error correction; Hybrid systems; Quantum cryptography; Quantum optics; Qubits; CNOT gate; Encrypted communication; IBMQ; NOT gate; Qiskit; Quanta computers; Quantum decryption; Quantum encryption; Quantum permutation pad; Quantum security; Quantum communication","","","","","","","Nurhadi A.I., Syambas N.R., Quantum key distribution (qkd) protocols: A survey, 2018 4th International Conference on Wireless and Telematics (ICWT), pp. 1-5, (2018); Diamanti E., Lo H.K., Qi B., Yuan Z., Practical challenges in quantum key distribution, Npj Quantum Inf, 2, (2016); Amer O., Garg V., Krawec W.O., An introduction to practical quantum key distribution, IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, 36, 3, pp. 30-55, (2021); Wang L.J., Zhang K.Y., Wang J.Y., Et al., Experimental authentication of quantum key distribution with post-quantum cryptography, Npj Quantum Inf, 7, (2021); Moody D., Alagic G., Apon D., Et al., Status report on the second round of the nist post-quantum cryptography standardization process, NIST Interagency/Internal Report (NISTIR), National Institute of Standards and Technology, (2020); Kuang R., Bettenburg N., Shannon Perfect Secrecy in a Discrete Hilbert Space, 2020 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE), pp. 249-255, (2020); Kuang R., Barbeau M., Quantum permutation pad for universal quantum safe cryptography, Springer Quantum Information Processing; Shende V.V., Prasad A.K., Markov I.L., Hayes J.P., Synthesis of reversible logic circuits, IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 22, pp. 710-722, (2003); Shor P.W., Polynomial-time algorithms for prime factorization and discrete logarithms on a quantum computer, SIAM Journal on Computing, 26, pp. 1484-1509, (1997); Grover L.K., A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search, Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 212-219, (1996); Bonnetain X., Naya-Plasencia M., Schrottenloher A., Quantum security analysis of aes, IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology, 2019, 2, pp. 55-93, (2019); Wang Z., Wei S., Long G., A Quantum Circuit Design of AES Requiring Fewer Quantum Qubits and Gate Operations, (2021); Zou J., Wei Z., Sun S., Liu X., Wu W., Quantum circuit implementations of aes with fewer qubits, Advances in Cryptology-ASIACRYPT, pp. 697-726, (2020); Grassl M., Langenberg B., Roetteler M., Steinwandt R., Applying grover's algorithm to AES: Quantum resource estimates, Post-Quantum Cryptography, pp. 29-43, (2016); Kim P., Han D., Jeong K.C., Time-space complexity of quantum search algorithms in symmetric cryptanalysis: Applying to AES and SHA-2, Quantum Information Processing, 17, pp. 1-39, (2018); Langenberg B., Pham H., Steinwandt R., Reducing the cost of implementing the advanced encryption standard as a quantum circuit, IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering, 1, pp. 1-12, (2020); Boykin P.O., Roychowdhury V., Optimal encryption of quantum bits, Physical Review A, 67, (2003); Ambainis A., Smith A., Small pseudo-random families of matrices: Derandomizing approximate quantum encryption, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3122, (2004)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","11th International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems, ICCCAS 2022","13 May 2022 through 15 May 2022","Singapore","181066","","978-166546989-0","","","English","Int.

It is a classical commercial medium, where several Internet of Things (IoT) devices are connected to information communication technology (ICT) and can communicate the information through quantum systems. Digital communications for future networks face various challenges, including data traffic, low latency, deployment of high-broadband, security, and privacy. Quantum communication, quantum sensors, quantum computing are the solutions to address these issues, as mentioned above. The secure transaction of data is the foremost essential needs for smart advanced applications in the future. In this paper, we proposed a quantum communication model system for future ICT and methodological flow. We show how to use blockchain in quantum computing and quantum cryptography to provide security and privacy in recent information sharing. We also discuss the latest global research trends for quantum communication technology in several countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Korea, and others. Finally, we discuss some open research challenges for quantum communication technology in various areas, including quantum internet and quantum computing. 2020 KIPS","Communication; Computing Security and Privacy; Quantum; Sensor; Smart Applications","Data communication systems; Digital communication systems; Information dissemination; Internet of things; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum theory; Advanced applications; Communication modeling; Digital communications; Information communication technology; Information sharing; Internet of Things (IOT); Quantum communication technology; Security and privacy; Quantum communication","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN; Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2019R1A2B5B01070416); National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, NICT","Funding text 1: Quantum research in Japan in quantum information processing, metrology, and sensing is funded by the Japan Science and Technology (JST) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

Here, for the first time, we report on a simple modular 3D printed low-cost (<250 €) setup which fulfils these needs for quantum sensing experiments based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds. Commercially available setups for optically detected magnetic resonance in microdiamonds used as quantum sensor for magnetic fields are not only beyond the reach of any high school (>10 000 €), but also have shortcomings from a didactical point of view, as all the components of the setup are hidden within a ’black box’, doomed to be successful ’plug and play’. In contrast, our open-source experimental kit consists of optical components that are placed inside 3D printed open-framed cubes, that can be arranged freely on a grid. This modular and flexible design can provide an inquiry-based learning experience both at undergraduate and high school level. © 2023 European Physical Society.","3D printed; experiments; low-cost; NV centers; ODMR","3D printing; Diamonds; Magnetic resonance; 3d printed; Higher School; Laboratory experiments; Low-costs; Modulars; Nitrogen-vacancy center; NV center; ODMR; Quantum technologies; Simple++; Costs","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (FKZ 13NI5388)","This work is funded as part of the BMBF project O3Q (FKZ 13NI5388) and we wish to acknowledge cooperation with Rüdiger Scholz, Kim-Alessandro Weber, Lara Lindloge, Jonas Homrighausen, Umutcan Bektas, Simon Klug, Nils Haverkamp and Alexander Pusch.

The direct component is calculated according to the opening and radiation geometries, and pathlength of the solar beam through the forest canopy. The diffuse component is obtained from the sky, tree, and landscape view factors. In this model, the distribution of foliage area with height and the effect of foliage clumping on both direct and diffuse radiation transmission are considered. The model has been verified using measurements from six quantum sensors (LI-COR Inc.) located at different positions in a small clear-cut (0.37 ha) in a 90-year-old western hemlock-Douglas fir forest. -from Authors","","clear cutting; forest; model; photosynthetic photon flux; slope","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","08948763","","","","English","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027881282"

Consider a special case, one parameter from many: many parameters of a process are unknown; estimate a specific linear combination of these parameters without having the ability to control any of the parameters. Superficially similar to single-parameter estimation, the problem retains genuinely multiparameter aspects. Geometric reasoning demonstrates the conditions, necessary and sufficient, for saturating the fundamental and attainable quantum-process bound in this context. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd","Cramer-Rao bound; Fisher information; Multi-parameter estimation; Process norm; Quantum metrology","","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Canada First Research Excellence Fund, CFREF","Both authors thank the University of New Mexico’s Center for Quantum Information and Control for providing a stimulating intellectual environment.

This need manifests itself in two rather different situations. The first is in quantum computing. The qubits in a quantum computer are subject to noise due both to imprecision in the operations (or gates) and to interactions with the external environment. They undergo errors when they are acted upon, and when they are just being stored (though hopefully not at the same rate). All the qubits in the computer must be kept error-free long enough for the computation to be completed. This is the principle of fault tolerance. A rather different situation occurs in quantum communication. Here, the sender and receiver (Alice and Bob) are assumed to be physically separated, and the qubits travel from the sender to the receiver over a (presumably noisy) channel. This channel is assumed to be the dominant source of errors. While the qubits may undergo processing before and after transmission, errors during this processing are considered negligible compared to the channel errors. This picture of transmission through a channel is similar in spirit to the paradigm underlying much of classical information theory. © Cambridge University Press 2013.","","Computation theory; Errors; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Quantum noise; Quantum optics; Channel error; Classical information; External environments; Or gates; Quantum Computing; Quantum error correcting codes; Quantum Information; Sender and receivers; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","978-113903480-7; 978-052189787-7","","","English","Quantum Error Correction","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929295230"

In the diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre system, the qubit resonance is excited by the microwave signal, and the frequency shift is proportional to the external magnetic field strength. Conventional narrow-band antennas or single resonators are not able to match the resonance frequency of the NV centre over a wide bandwidth, resulting in degraded sensitivity and dynamic range of the sensor. Here, the authors designed a compact broadband antenna, which achieves a fractional bandwidth of 71.43% at the Zeeman splitting frequency of 2.87 GHz. With the introduced slot structure on the antenna, a higher microwave near field strength can also be achieved, which improves the magnetic field sensitivity and dynamic range. By applying our design antenna, the experimental results indicate that the NV-based quantum sensor achieves a sensitivity of 3.07 μT/Hz1/2 and a dynamic range up to 44.9 dB, which are both greatly improved compared to sensor that uses a conventional antenna. © 2022 The Authors.

We generated with the help of PPLN waveguide, C-band laser diode, and an EDFA entangled photon pairs, transmitted them over the turbulent FSO link, separated different wavelength channels with coarse WDM demultiplexers, and measured the coincidence counts of four wavelength channels with the help of correlated photon detection system. To improve the system tolerance to turbulence effects we use adaptive optics (AO) and demonstrate that the AO can be used to increase the coincidence counts.  © 2023 IEEE.","adaptive optics (AO); entanglement distribution; Free-space optical (FSO) links; periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide; wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)","Erbium doped fiber amplifiers; Lithium; Niobium compounds; Optical waveguides; Photons; Adaptive optic; C-bands; Entanglement distribution; Free-space optical link; Multiwavelength; Periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides; University of Arizona; Wavefront correction; Wavelength channels; Wavelength-division multiplexing; Adaptive optics","","","","","Raytheon Technologies, RTC","This work is supported by Raytheon Technologies.

For this reason, many nations around the globe are investing to emerge within the global quantum ecosystem through initiating national programmes and international partnerships. Nonetheless, some other countries are still running behind and yet their governments need to take series actions to help their private and public sectors adapt to the looming changes, considering the new regulations required and the huge influence that QT will present in the near future. In this opinion piece, the authors provide, to the best of their knowledge, the first generally applicable, yet comprehensive and brief, framework for leveraging the emerging QT to facilitate the establishment of national initiatives properly. The insights presented in this article were driven based on investigating various approaches, initiatives, and roadmaps adopted globally and meeting with local and regional leaders, professionals, and governmental officials. Furthermore, taken into account socioeconomic and institutional dimensions of the Libyan society, the framework for the Libyan nation is projected. This opinion piece is intended to inspire researchers, technical industrial experts, stakeholders, and governmental bodies to find roles they need to play to bring QT forward. © 2023 The Authors.

Current quantum platforms in experimental atomic and optical physics based on CMOS sensors and charged coupled device cameras are limited by either low sensitivity or slow operational speed. Here an array of single-photon avalanche diodes is integrated with solid-state spin defects in diamond to build a fast wide-field quantum sensor, achieving a frame rate up to 100 kHz. The design of the experimental setup to perform spatially resolved imaging of quantum systems is presented. A few exemplary applications, including sensing DC and AC magnetic fields, temperature, strain, local spin density, and charge dynamics, are experimentally demonstrated using a nitrogen-vacancy ensemble diamond sample. The developed photon detection array is broadly applicable to other platforms such as atom arrays trapped in optical tweezers, optical lattices, donors in silicon, and rare earth ions in solids. © 2023 The Authors.

PPFD is one of the critically important measurements to control photosynthetic reaction of plants. Conventionally a dedicated quantum sensor is used to measure PPFD. A quantum sensor, however, can measure PPFD of a target point at once. Thus considerable cost and labor would be consumed if the quantum sensors were introduced for managing photosynthetic reaction of numerous plants in a large greenhouse for growing commercial crops. In order to solve the problem, we propose a method for measuring PPFD using a commercially available digital camera. The method estimates spectral irradiance of daylight, fluctuating hour by hour according to weather condition changes, on the basis of the color information of a reference object in an image captured by a digital camera. Then PPFD is derived from the estimated spectral irradiance. For practical use, plural reference objects are placed in a plant community and captured as an image. PPFDs at the positions of the reference objects in the captured image are simultaneously measured. We believe that proposed method is useful in real cultivation. We conducted experiments in outdoor environment. During the experiments, a Nikon digital SLR camera D300 and a white plaster ball as a reference object were used. We finally confirmed that the average error rate of PPFD measurements by this method was 2.58%, and the maximum was within 5% which is equivalent to the accuracy of the quantum sensor on the market. © 2017 ISHS.","Commercial digital camera; Image processing; Spectral irradiance","","","","","","","","Bird R.E., Riordan C., Simple solar spectral model for direct and diffuse irradiance on horizontal and tilted planes at the earth's surface for cloudless atmospheres, J.

A BH behaves as a reflecting quantum channel in a very special regime, which allows for a receiver to perfectly recover the absorbed quantum information. The quantum channel of a perfectly reflecting (PR) BH is the probabilistically weighted sum of infinitely many qubit cloning channels. In this work, we reveal the statistical communication background of the information evaporation process of PR BHs. We show that the density of the cloned quantum particles in function of the PR BH's mass approximates a Chi-square distribution, while the stimulated emission process is characterized by zero-mean, circular symmetric complex Gaussian random variables. The results lead to the existence of Rayleigh random distributed coefficients in the probability density evolution, which confirms the presence of Rayleigh fading (a special type of random fluctuation) in the statistical communication model of BH information evaporation. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Black hole; quantum information; quantum Shannon theory; statistical communication","Clone cells; Cloning; Communication channels (information theory); Evaporation; Gravitation; Probability distributions; Quantum channel; Quantum communication; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Rayleigh fading; Stars; Black holes; Chi-square distribution; Communication modeling; Of quantum-information; Probability density evolutions; Quantum Information; Quantum shannon theories; Stimulated emission process; Statistics","","","","","European Structural Fund; European Structured Fund; European Commission, EC; European Cooperation in Science and Technology, COST, (MP1006); Hungarian Scientific Research Fund, OTKA, (k-112125)","This work was partially supported by the GOP-1.1.1-11-2012-0092 project sponsored by the EU and European Structural Fund, and by the COST Action MP1006.

However, this limit assumes perfect projective measurements of the quantum registers. This requirement is not practical in many physical systems, such as NMR spectroscopy, where a weakly interacting external probe is used as a measurement device. Here, we show that in the framework of quantum nano-NMR spectroscopy, in which these limitations are inherent, the ultimate precision limit is still achievable using control and a finely tuned measurement. © 2020, The Author(s).","","Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Larmor frequencies; Measurement device; Physical systems; Precision limits; Projective measurement; Quantum probe; Quantum register; Quantum sensors; Probes","","","","","ASTERIQS; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (770929); European Research Council, ERC, (667192); Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities","A.R. acknowledges the support of ERC grant QRES, project No. 770929, grant agreement No. 667192 (Hyperdiamond), and the ASTERIQS and DiaPol projects.

Unlike other recent endeavors in relativistic quantum information, we are able to quantify and maximize how much information can be transferred through such a quantum process by calculating its scope. We show that, surprisingly, relativistic noise can increase the amount of information that can be transferred, and in fact, even if the initial state is arbitrarily close to the completely mixed state, information can still be transferred perfectly. Additionally, we explore the relativistic effects of velocity and gravity on quantum information processing, and we briefly discuss how quantum computation is affected by general relativity. In particular, we show that the large Wigner rotation caused by a black hole as described in the Schwarzchild metric can greatly increase the informatic content of a qubit. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.","Capacity; General relativity; Non-complete positivity; Quantum information","Computation theory; Gravitation; Information theory; Quantum computers; Relativity; Stars; Amount of information; Capacity; General Relativity; Non-complete positivity; Quantum Information; Quantum information theory; Quantum-information processing; Relativistic effects; Article; calculation; data analysis; data synthesis; information processing; kinematics; mathematical computing; neighborhood; noise; Quantum optics","","","","","","","Alsing P.M., Stephenson G.J., Kilian P., Spin-induced non-geodesic motion, gyroscopic precession, Wigner rotation and EPR correlations of massive spin- 1 2 particles in a gravitational field, (2009); Bauke H., Et al., Relativistic spin operators in various electromagnetic environments, Phys Rev A, 89, (2014); Breuer H.-P., Petruccione F., The theory of open quantum systems, (2002); Celeri L.C., Kiosses V., Terno D.R., Spin and localization of relativistic fermions and uncertainty relations, Phys Rev A, 94, (2016); Choi M.D., Completely positive linear maps on complex matrices, Linear Algebra Appl, 10, pp. 285-290, (1975); Choi T., Relativistic spin operator and Lorentz transformation of the spin state of a massive Dirac particle, J Korean Phys Soc, 62, pp. 1085-1092, (2013); Cover T., Thomas J., Elements of information theory, (2006); Crowder T., Representations of Quantum Channels, (2013); Crowder T., A quantum representation for involution groups, Electron Notes Theor Comput Sci, 276, pp. 145-158, (2011); Crowder T., A linearization of quantum channels, J Geom Phys, 92, pp. 157-166, (2015); Crowder T., Martin K., Classical representations of qubit channels, Electron Notes Theor Comp Sci, 270, pp. 37-58, (2011); Crowder T., Martin K., Information theoretic representations of qubit channels, Found Phys, 42, pp. 976-983, (2012); Crowder T., Lanzagorta M., The scope of a relativistic quantum process with spin-momentum entanglement, Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation.

A micro-integrated optical system (volume ∼25 mL) for trapping and manipulation of neutral atoms is presented. This setup focuses and precisely overlaps two high power laser beams (1064 nm, up to 2 W total, wR = 34 µm) launched via a single-mode, polarization maintaining optical fiber, thereby realizing a crossed beam optical dipole trap (ODT). Adhesive bonding is qualified in application relevant geometries and material systems of micro-integrated optical systems for application on mobile platforms or space. Fused silica test blocks (bond area 2 × 4 mm2) are bonded with four different adhesives on silicon wafers. Theses samples are aged by thermal cycling (up to −55 °C to 150 °C) and/or gamma-radiation (10 000 mSv) and subsequently the bond strength is evaluated by die shear testing according to MIL-STD-883L. The influence of the environmental aging on the bond strength is presented, the failure mode and the influence of fillets discussed. In addition, the effects of plasma cleaning on the bond strength in this geometry is presented. © 2023 SPIE.

Firstly, the interaction model between photons and atoms is established. Secondly, the QRCS results of different physical models of the equivalent multi-atom target, including one-dimensional linear target, two-dimensional planar target and three-dimensional cube target are derived. The influence of the shapes on QRCS is analyzed. The results show that when the additional random phase follows the uniformly distribution of [0,2 pi], the QRCS values of different models are almost the same at different angles. Finally, the proposed method is verified by simulations. © 2023 Applied Computational Electromagnetics Society (ACES).","quantum radar scattering cross-sectional area; quantum scattering; target characteristics","Computational electromagnetics; Photons; Cross sectional area; Interaction modeling; Photon scattering; Physical modelling; Quantum radar scattering cross-sectional area; Quantum scattering; Radar scattering; Random-phase; Scattering process; Target characteristic; Atoms","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62071371); Chinese Aeronautical Establishment, CAE, (20182007002); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFB3902400)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2022YFB3902400, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62071371; and in part by the Aviation Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 20182007002).","Yang J., Analysis of the development law and macroscopic trend of radar technology [J], Journal of Radar, 1, 1, pp. 19-27, (2012); Wu Q., Y Bai Y., Zhang X., Et al., Performance Analysis of interferometric quantum radar Measurement Methods [J], Journal of Nanjing University (Natural Sciences), (2016); Tan H., Dai Z., Research on target detection based on quantum technology [J], Ship Electronic Engineering, 4, (2010); Guo G., Quantum information technology [J], Bulletin of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 17, 5, pp. 521-525, (2010); Ge J., A review on the development of quantum imaging and quantum radar in Remote sensing [J], Journal of the Chinese Academy of Electronic Science, 11, 2, pp. 145-1414, (2014); Li C., Quantum Communication and quantum Computing [M], Quantum Communication and Quantum Computing, (2000); Lanzagorta M., Quantum radar cross sections, Proceedings of SPIE-The International Society for Optical Engineering, 7727, 2, (2010)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 International Applied Computational Electromagnetics Society Symposium, ACES-China 2023","15 August 2023 through 18 August 2023","Hangzhou","192824","","978-173350965-7","","","English","Int.

But operating these devices in realistic environments is currently extremely challenging, and for the most part the advantages of choosing a quantum sensor over a conventional alternative are lost in the transition from laboratory to noisy field-based environments. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time in hardware that tailored light pulses, designed and implemented in software using robust control techniques, can substantially mitigate some of the most nefarious effects in a Bragg atom interferometer. We show experimentally that embedding robust control into sensor operation can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of a state-of-the-art Bragg-pulse cold-atom interferometric sensor by a factor of 4× under ideal conditions. In the presence of laser-intensity noise that varies up to 20% from shot-to-shot, commensurate with common platform vibrations, we show experimentally that using the same robust control solutions preserves fringe visibility with minimal degradation while the utility of the primitive Gaussian pulses collapses, delivering an at least 8× improvement in phase-estimation uncertainty compared with primitive pulse schemes. Across all observations, robust control delivers better performance in a noisy environment than the native hardware performance with primitive pulses under approximately ideal conditions. Finally, building on this demonstration we present a validated theoretical concept to extend this performance improvement to compact devices using concatenated sequences of robust pulses designed to enhance the sensor’s scale factor. Time-domain simulations reveal up to 10× performance enhancement in the presence of realistic atomic-cloud effects at 102ℏk momentum separation. These results show for the first time that software-defined quantum sensor operation can deliver useful performance in environmental regimes where primitive operation is impossible, providing a pathway to augment the performance of current and next generation portable cold-atom inertial sensors in real fielded settings. © 2023 SPIE.","Atom Interferometry; Cold Atoms; Inertial Sensing; Quantum Control; Quantum Gravimetry; Quantum Navigation; Quantum Sensing; Robust Control","Atoms; Interferometers; Interferometry; Signal to noise ratio; Time domain analysis; Visibility; Atom interferometry; Cold atoms; Inertial sensing; Performance; Quantum control; Quantum gravimetry; Quantum navigation; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Sensor operations; Robust control","","","","","","","Berman P., Atom Interferometry, (1997); Kasevich M., Chu S., Atomic interferometry using stimulated Raman transitions, Physical Review Letters, 67, 2, pp. 181-184, (1991); Altin P.

The vector potential thus acts as a quantum ""phase plate"", changing the phase difference between interfering electron wavefunctions in a non-dispersive, gauge-invariant manner.

There are different kinds of measuring light and these are the LUX meter, Quantum Meters, Electrical Light meter and other kinds of sensor that measures light. One of these is the Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR). Studies show that the light in forest canopies typically requires a huge quantity of light sensors. Some of these light sensors usually require huge amount of money, hence, detailed studies for this agricultural used are very expensive. This study shows the creation and testing of a practical and inexpensive sensor for measuring photo-synthetic photon flux density or PAR. Detailed instructions are provided for assembly and calibration. The sensor was made from a blue enhanced silicon photodiode held within an 8mm substrate protective casing coated with IR blocking filter. The Apogee SQ-520 Quantum Sensor was used as a standard for comparison. The stability of the VTB8440BH sensor compared favourably to Apogee SQ-420 Quantum Sensor. Based on the data gathered, the group was able to obtain the linearity of the proposed and commercially PAR sensors which has a correlation coefficient of 0.99.

This paper presents two methods to calculate the PPFD of daylight spectra using low cost optic sensors. The first method uses the spectral sensitivity functions of spectral sensors to recreate the quantum sensitivity curve of quantum sensors. Two sets of spectral sensitivity functions are compared. The second method calculates the PPFD based on the calculated correlated colour temperature and a spectral reconstruction using the CIE daylight model. It is demonstrated that all methods offer a useful estimation of the PPFD with correspondingly similar daylight spectra, but the supposedly simpler method, which is based on weighting of the individual channels, is more stable against deviations from the CIE daylight model. © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2022.","","Spectroscopy;

However, these devices are prone to noise and environmental factors that can degrade the quality of the data and compromise the accuracy of the measurements. This research proposes an effective Adversarial Autoencoders (AAEs) framework for denoising and signal recovery in QGs to improve the accuracy and reliability of navigation systems in space. By denoising signals, AAEs can improve the accuracy of measurements and can help reduce the risk of communication failures and increase the efficiency of cognitive communication systems. Overall, our method offers a promising solution for denoising and signal recovery in noisy QG schemes, demonstrating that it can accurately recover signals with low reconstruction error. This approach has the potential to improve the reliability and accuracy of QGs, leading to safer and more efficient communication systems. © 2023 IEEE.","Deep learning; Neural network; Quantum Metrology; Quantum Sensing; Quantum Sensors","Cognitive systems; Deep learning; Gyroscopes; Learning systems; Navigation systems; Signal denoising; Space applications; Auto encoders; Communications systems; Critical component; De-noising; Deep learning; Neural-networks; Quantum metrology; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Signal recovery; Signal reconstruction","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (OMA 2231377)","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by National Science Foundation Grant No. OMA 2231377.","Passaro V., Cuccovillo A., Vaiani L., De Carlo M., Campanella C.E., Gyroscope technology and applications: A review in the industrial perspective, Sensors, 17, (2017); Edu I., Obreja R., Grigorie T., Current technologies and trends in the development of gyros used in navigation applications: A review, (2011); Armenise M., Ciminelli C., Leonardis F., Diana R., Passaro V., Peluso F., Gyroscope Technologies for Space Applications, (2003); Degen C.L., Reinhard F., Cappellaro P., Quantum sensing, Reviews of Modern Physics, (2017); Shimazoe K., Et al., Quantum sensing for biomedical applications, 2021 IEEE Nucl.

The m-CdSe QDs were prepared using aqueous chemical synthesis method and were characterized to get insight about their structural and functional properties. The formation of m-CdSe QDs was confirmed by using Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The optical properties (absorption and emission) of m-CdSe QDs were studied as a function of cadmium salt concentration, selenide salt concentration and pH. The effect of incubation time with melamine on fluorescence of QDs was also studied in order to check the stability of quanta-sensor. The linearity range of this quanta-sensor was found to be 0.01 nM to 60 μM, with LOD of 0.013 nM. The quanta-sensor exhibited good reproducibility, selectivity and acted as a potential probe for detection of melamine in milk samples. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cadmium; Chalcogenides; Melamine; Optical probe; Quanta-sensor","Cadmium; Chalcogenides; Dairies; Fluorescence; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; II-VI semiconductors; Melamine; Optical properties; Probes; Propionic acid; Semiconductor quantum dots; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Absorption and emissions; Artificial proteins; Cadmium chalcogenides; Fluorescent labels; Functional properties; Optical probe; Reproducibilities; Salt concentration; Cadmium compounds","","","","","GATE-JRF; SERB DST; SERB-DST; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी, (GAP 0352); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India, CSIR; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge Director, CSIR-CSIO for his constant encouragement and support.

These devices can also benefit from optical fiber integration. In this work we describe experimental results supported by a theoretical model of single-beam optical pumping of 87Rb atoms within a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. The observed 50% population increase in the pumped F = 2, mF = 2 Zeeman substate along with the depopulation of remaining Zeeman substates enabled us to achieve a threefold improvement in the relative population of the mF = 2 substate within the F = 2 manifold, with 60% of the F = 2 population residing in the mF = 2 dark sublevel. Based on theoretical model, we propose methods to further improve the pumping efficiency in alkali-filled hollow-core fibers.","","","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","15394794","","","37219315","English","Opt Lett","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160015877"

For a PD channel, the degraded environment state can be expressed from the channel output state up to a degrading map. PD channels can be restricted to the set of optical channels, which allows for the parties to exploit the benefits in experimental quantum communications. We show that for a PD channel, the partial degradability property leads to higher quantum data rates in comparison with those of a degradable channel. The PD property is particularly convenient for quantum communications and allows one to implement the experimental quantum protocols with higher performance. We define a coding scheme for PD channels and give the achievable rates of quantum communication. © 2014 IEEE.","Quantum communications; Quantum computing; Quantum Shannon theory","Channel coding; Computation theory; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Environment state; Optical channels; Quantum channel; Quantum coding; Quantum Computing; Quantum Information; Quantum protocols; Quantum shannon theories; Quantum communication","","","","","","","Bradler K., Dutil N., Hayden P., Muhammad A., Conjugate degrad-ability and the quantum capacity of cloning channels, J.

An Eppley Precision Spectral Pyranometer (PSP) was used to measure K↓ and a LICOR Li-190 quantum sensor was used to measure PAR (photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)). The mean daily PAR/K↓ ratio decreased during the hot-dry season and increased in the warm-wet season. The results show that the variation was due to trends in cloudiness and the associated atmospheric moisture associated with the movement of the Haadley cell circulation system.","","Aerosols; Atmospherics; Biomass; Clouds; Dust; Moisture; Photons; Photosynthesis; Sensors; Turbidity; Vapors; Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD); Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); Precision spectral pyranometer (PSP); Quantum sensors; Solar radiation","","","","","","","Eck T.F., Holben B.N., Ward D.E., Dubovik O., Reid J.S., Smirnov A., Mukelabai M.M., Hsu N.C., O'Neill N.T., Slutsker I., Characterization of the optical properties of biomass burning aerosols in Zambia during the 1997 ZIBBEE field campaign, J.

The rapid advancement of the quantum technologies ecosystem has made it imperative to assess the maturity of these technologies and their imminent acceleration towards commercial viability. The current status of quantum technologies is presented and the need for a quantum-ready ecosystem is emphasised. Standard Quantum Technology Readiness Levels (QTRLs) are formulated and innovative models and tools are defined to evaluate the readiness of specific quantum technology. In addition to QTRLs, Quantum Commercial Readiness Levels (QCRLs) is introduced to provide a robust framework for evaluating the commercial viability and market readiness of quantum technologies. Furthermore, relevant indicators concerning key stakeholders, including government, industry, and academia are discussed and ethics and protocols implications are described, to deepen the understanding of the readiness for quantum technology and to support the development of a robust and effective quantum ecosystem. © 2023 QURECA and The Authors.

These sensors enable us to measure a mean photon flux density in a crop canopy, so it is possible to predict the growth and the yield of the crop. In this study, we introduced these tube light sensors, and compared distribution of the output voltage. The Variation of the continuous type was much smaller than that of the discrete type. We calculated the Standard deviation and the coefficient of Variation of the output voltage, when some light Spots shone on these sensors randomly. These values of the continuous type were about from one eighth to one ninth times as large as those of the discrete type. We indicated that the continuous type was much stable. © 1992, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

The project was conducted on currently available IBM quantum systems using the Qiskit development kit. This work extends previously reported implementation of QPP used to encrypt basis states and demonstrates that application of the QPP scheme is not limited to the encryption of basis states. For this implementation, a pad of 56 2-qubit Permutation matrices was used, providing 256 bits of entropy for the QPP algorithm. An image of a cat was used as the plaintext for this experiment. The plaintext was randomized using a classical XOR function prior to the state preparation procedure. To create corresponding superposition states, we applied a novel operator defined in this paper. These superposition states were then encrypted using QPP, with 2-qubit Permutation Operators, producing superposition ciphertext states. Due to the lack of a quantum channel, we omitted the transmission and executed the decryption procedure on the same IBM quantum system. If a quantum channel existed, the superposition ciphertext states could be transmitted as qubits, and be directly decrypted on a different quantum system. We provide a brief discussion of the security, although the focus of the paper remains on the implementation. Previously we have demonstrated QPP operating in both classical and quantum computers, offering an interesting opportunity to bridge the security gap between classical and quantum systems. This work broadens the applicability of QPP for the encryption of basis states as well as superposition states. We believe that quantum encryption schemes that are not limited to basis states will be integral to a secure quantum internet, to reduce vulnerabilities introduced by using two separate algorithms for secure communication between a quantum and a classical computer. © 2023, The Author(s).","IBM Quantum; Qiskit; QKD; QPP; Quantum Circuits; Quantum Communication; Quantum Cryptography; Quantum Encryption; Quantum Information; Quantum-safe Communication; Superposition states; Symmetric cryptography; Symmetric encryption","Communication channels (information theory); Quantum channel; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Qubits; Security of data; Timing circuits; IBM quantum; Qiskit; QKD; Quantum circuit; Quantum encryption; Quantum Information; Quantum permutation pad; Quantum-safe communication; Safe communications; Superposition state; Symmetric cryptography; Symmetric encryption; Quantum communication","","","","","Quantropi Inc., (ON K1Z 8P9); International Business Machines Corporation, IBM","Authors acknowledge IBM for their free of charge 5-qubit quantum computers used for this study.

To accomplish this, accurate monitoring of the charge and discharge current of the battery over a wide temperature range is essential. We developed a compact diamond quantum sensor head with a size of 1 × 1 × 0.5 cm3, consisting of a (111) high-pressure and high-temperature synthesized diamond with nitrogen-vacancy centers, by electron beam irradiation, which was adhered to the top of the multimode fiber and surrounded by the microwave antenna, for EV battery monitoring. We demonstrated that our quantum sensor achieved the current measurement accuracy of 10 mA in the −150 to 150 °C temperature range with a bandwidth of 500 Hz under atmospheric pressure and confirmed that the diamond quantum sensor meets the performance requirements of EV current sensors. Moreover, the temperature dependence of shot noise and external magnetic field noise were investigated, and their relation to the linewidth and contrast of the optically detected magnetic resonance spectrum were analyzed. At high temperatures, the contrast decreased because shortening of the singlet lifetime, which accelerate the initialization. At low temperatures, the contrast was slightly decreased. This is possibly a result of increased losses due to condensation on the microwave antenna. © 2023 The Authors","Electric vehicles; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Quantum sensing; Temperature dependence","Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon fibers; Diamonds; Electric vehicles; Magnetic resonance; Nitrogen; Secondary batteries; Temperature distribution; Battery monitoring; Charge and discharge; Charge current; Discharges currents; Electric vehicle batteries; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Temperature dependence; Wide temperature operation; Electric discharges","","","","","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (0118068379, JPMXS 0118067395)","This work was supported by MEXT Quantum Leap Flagship Program (Q-LEAP) Grant Number JPMXS 0118067395 and 0118068379 .","Sanguesa J.A., Torres-Sanz V., Garrido P., Martinez F.J., Marquez-Barja J.M., A review on electric vehicles: technologies and challenges, SmartCities, 4, pp. 372-404, (2021); Hatano Y., Shin J., Tanigawa J., Shigenobu Y., Nakazono A., High-precision robust monitoring of charge / discharge current over a wide dynamic range for electric vehicle batteries using diamond quantum sensors, Sci.

We extend quantum metrology beyond this standard setting and consider the estimation of a physical process with quantum memory, here referred to as a parametrized quantum comb. We present a theoretic framework of metrology of quantum combs, and derive a general upper bound of the comb quantum Fisher information. The bound can be operationally interpreted as the quantum Fisher information of a memoryless quantum channel times a dimensional factor. We then show an example where the bound can be attained up to a factor of 4. With the example and the bound, we show that memory in quantum sensors plays an even more crucial role in the estimation of combs than in the standard setting of quantum metrology. © 2019 American Physical Society.","","Fisher information matrix; Quantum channel; Quantum communication; Quantum entanglement; Fisher information; General upper bound; Memory effects; Physical process; Quantum memory; Quantum metrology; Quantum sensors; Standard setting; Communication channels (information theory)","","","","","National Center for Competence in Research, (200020_165843); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, RGC, UGC, (17300918)","The author is grateful to Giulio Chiribella, Joseph M.

On the other hand, quantum sensors, capable of working with nanoscale precision, do not provide precise frequency resolution over a wide range of frequencies. Using a single spin in diamond, we present a measurement protocol for quantum probes which enables full signal reconstruction on a nanoscale spatial resolution up to potentially 100 GHz. We achieve 58nT/Hz amplitude and 0.095rad/Hz phase sensitivity and a relative frequency uncertainty of 10-12 for a 1.51 GHz signal within 10 s of integration.

The real-time monitoring platform, which operate unattended and require relatively less maintenance, can collect valuable data from extremely high temporal resolution. It is equipped with a Vaisala WXT510 weather transmitter on a meteorological tower for collecting data on wind direction and speed, barometric pressure, air temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall. It also incorporates a YSI 6600EDS multiparameter sonde, a YSI 9600 nitrate monitor with a pre-filter, and LI-COR (Lincoln, Nebraska) quantum sensors. The data collected by the cost effective autonomous sampling MARVIN platform also are extremely accurate, which help researchers to track storm events, lake releases, seasonal patterns, and diurnal cycles.","","Algae; Atmospheric humidity; Fish; Pressure effects; Rain; Real time systems; algae; air temperature; algal bloom; environmental monitoring; rainfall; relative humidity; sensor; wind direction; wind velocity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00933651","","","","English","Sea Technol.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-35248848918"

This is due to their ability to switch between two well-defined states. Thus, the characterization of the state-switching process is essential for the application of these materials. For vanadium dioxide (VO 2), the phase transition can be determined from temperature, magnetic field, and dielectric constant. In this paper, we propose a diamond quantum sensing approach based on nitrogen-vacancy centers for analyzing phase transitions. By using lock-in-based optically detected magnetic resonance and Rabi measurement protocols, temperature and magnetic field can reflect local IMT information of the circuit, and microwave can determine IMT information of an electrical isolation region. Our multifunctional quantum sensor exhibits local, nondestructive, and integrated measurements, which are useful for reliability testing in IMT technology applications.  © 2023 Author(s).","","Magnetic resonance; Metal insulator transition; Nondestructive examination; Optical switches; Vanadium dioxide; Brain functions; Insulator metal transition; Lock-in; Magnetic-field; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Optical analogues; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Quantum sensors; State switching; Switching process; Magnetic fields","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12005218, 52130510, 62225506); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (YSBR-049); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (WK2030000062); Key Research and Development Program of Jiangxi Province, (BE2022066-2)","This work was supported by the Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology 2021ZD0303200, the CAS Project for Young Scientists in Basic Research (No. YSBR-049), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 62225506, 12005218, and 52130510), the Key Research and Development Plan of Jiangsu Province (No. BE2022066-2), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. WK2030000062).

This control is realized over several platforms, one particular being photonics which employs state of the art fabrication techniques that achieve integrated nanocircuit components. The Hong-Ou-Mandel effect underlies the basic entangling mechanism of linear optical quantum computing, and is a critical feature in the design of nanophotonic circuits used for quantum information processing. We will present some results from an on-chip Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) experiment that replaces the conventional beam splitter with a more compact and highly versatile ring resonator allowing greater functionality with an expanded parameter space dubbed Hong-Ou-Mandel Manifold (HOMM). The overarching goal of this work is to demonstrate on-chip, scalable, dynamically configurable quantum-optical interconnects for integration into photonic quantum information processing devices. © 2019 SPIE.","Entanglement; Hong-Ou-Mandel effect; Integrated photonics; Microring resonator; Quantum optics","Optical resonators; Photonics; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Entanglement; Hong-Ou-Mandel effect; Integrated photonics; Linear optical quantum computing; Microring resonator; Quantum information processing devices; Quantum-information processing; State-of-the art fabrications; Quantum optics","","","","","","","Lo H.K., Curty M., Tamaki K., Secure quantum key distribution, Nature Photonics, 80, pp. 595-604, (2014); Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Advances in quantum metrology, Nature Photonics, 50, pp. 222-229, (2011); Muller R.P., Blume-Kohout R., The promise of quantum simulation, ACS Nano, (2015); Bonneau D., Silverstone J.W., Thompson M.G., Silicon quantm photonics, Silicon Photonics III: Systems and Applications, (2016); Han S., Seok T.J., Quack N., Yoo B.W., Wu M.C., Large-scale silicon photonic switches with moveable directional couplers, Optica, 20, pp. 370-375, (2015); Leuthold J., Koos C., Freude W., Nonlinear silicon photonics, Nature Photonics, 4, (2010); Preble S.F., Fanto M.L., Steidle J.A., Tison C.C., Howland G.A., Wang Z., Alsing P.M., On-chip quantum interference from a single silicon ring-resonator source, Physical Review Applied, 4, (2015); Dirac P.A.M., The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, (1930); O'Brien J.L., Furusawa A., Vuckovic J., Photonic quantum technologies, Nature Photonics, 3, (2009); Gerry C.C., Knight P.L., Introductory Quantum Optics, (2004); Sakurai J.J., Napolitano J.J., Modern Quantum Mechanics, (2014); Hach E.E., Preble S.F., Elshaari A.W., Alsing P.M., Fanto M.L., Scalable hong-ou-mandel manifolds in quantum-optical ring resonators, Physical Review A, 89, (2013); Tison C.C., Steidle J.A., Fanto M.L., Wang Z., Mogent N.A., Rizzo A., Preble S.F., Alsing P.M., The path to increasing the coincidence e-ciency of integrated photonic sources, Optics Express, 25, (2017)","J.R.

To demonstrate the use of this facility, a single luminaire was tested at heights of 1. 5 and 2. 0 m. Test data were analyzed and contour plots of PPFD were produced. PPFD distributions were then calculated for 2. 0 m and 3. 0 m luminaire spacing grids with a luminaire height of 1. 5 m. The uniformity coefficient was determined and a contour plot of PPFD was made of a typical grid sector for each spacing. The 2. 0 m spacing had an average PPFD of 90. 5 mu mol s** minus **1 m** minus **2 and a uniformity coefficient of 0. 84; whereas for the 3. 0 m spacing, these values were 40. 2 and 0. 75 respectively.","","ELECTRIC LIGHTING - Photosynthesis; GREENHOUSES - Lighting; PHOTONS - Measurements; LUMINAIRES; PHOTON FLUX DENSITY DISTRIBUTION; LIGHTING FIXTURES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00012351","","TAAEA","","English","Trans ASAE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0023310866"

Many big companies are actively researching this area and have built open-source frameworks which can be used to develop solutions for problems that connect be solved by classical computers. One such problem is the solution of Navier-Stokes equations which takes exponential time for simulation but using quantum computers, they can be solved in polynomial time. But the current state of quantum computation does not enable everyone to test their implementation on a real quantum computer. In this situation, a simulator enables rapid prototype and testing techniques and algorithms for when the real quantum computer is ready.

It has been shown that for quantum entangled interferometers that the value of quantum entanglement deteriorates in an environment with attenuation. This paper introduces a correction method that allows the quantum radar to maintain excellent performance even when dealing with an environment with attenuation. The correction method is analogous to techniques used in adaptive optics to improve images. Correction approaches based on signal sources deliberately introduced into the environment and electromagnetic sources already present in the environment are considered. Closed form expressions for estimating the range error are derived for the cases when the radar uses N entangled photons for imaging or N separate imaging photons. Simulations of radar range error estimates for entangled and separate photon cases for propagation media with widely varying attenuation properties are provided. Comparisons of estimates with and without atmospheric correction are given. The atmospheric correction method extends the range of the beneficial effects of entanglement by a factor of 82, i.e. to 5000 km for a slowly varying propagation medium. For a propagation medium with 50 times as much variation, the atmospheric correction method offers super sensitivity for three times the range of the uncorrected case. © 2009 SPIE.","Atmospheric correction; Entanglement; Heisenberg limit; Quantum imaging; Quantum metrology; Quantum radar; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Super sensitivity","Atmospherics; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Light; Light sources; Photons; Quantum optics; Radar imaging; Radar theory; Sensitivity analysis; Sensors; Separation; Atmospheric correction; Entanglement; Heisenberg limit; Quantum imaging; Quantum metrology; Quantum radar; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Super sensitivity; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Quantum-enhanced measurements: Beating the standard quantum limit, Science, 306, pp. 1330-11310, (2004); Lee H., Kok P., Dowling J.P., A quantum rosetta stone for interferometry, J.

In many scenarios, precision is not the sole target; the acquired information must be protected once it is generated in the sensing process. Considering a remote sensing scenario where a local site performs cooperative sensing with a remote site to collect sensitive information at the remote site, the loss of sensing data inevitably causes sensitive information to be revealed. Quantum key distribution is known to be a reliable solution for secure data transmission; however, it fails if an eavesdropper accesses the sensing data generated at a remote site. In this study we demonstrate that, by sharing entanglement between local and remote sites, secure quantum remote sensing can be realized, and the secure level is characterized by asymmetric Fisher information gain. Concretely, only the local site can acquire the estimated parameter accurately with Fisher information approaching 1. In contrast, the accessible Fisher information for an eavesdropper is nearly zero even if he or she obtains the raw sensing data at the remote site. This achievement is primarily due to the nonlocal calibration and control of the probe state at the remote site. Our results explore one significant advantage of ""quantumness""and extend the notion of quantum metrology to the security realm.  © 2020 American Physical Society.

Although we tend to think of information as abstract, information is physical, and computing is a physical process. How then should we understand information in a quantum world, in which physical systems may exist in multiple states at once and are altered by the very act of observation? This question has evolved into an exciting new field of research called Quantum Information (QI). QI challenges many accepted rules and practices in computer science. For example, a quantum computer would turn certain ""hard"" problems into ""soft"" problems, and would render common computationally-secure encryption methods (such as RSA) insecure. At the same time, quantum communication would provide an unprecedented kind of intrinsic information security at the level of the smallest physical objects used to store or transmit the information. This talk provides a general introduction to the subject of quantum information and its relevance to cyber security. In the first part, two of the stranger aspects of quantum physics - namely, superposition and uncertainty - are explained, along with their relation to the concept of information. These ideas are illustrated with a few examples: quantum ID cards, quantum key distribution, and Grover's quantum search algorithm. The classic man-in-the-middle attack is illustrated in regards to secret sharing (e.g., key exchange) to illustrate how QI methods can be used to thwart such threats. The state-of-the-art in quantum computing and communication hardware is then discussed, along with the daunting technological challenges that must be overcome. Relevant experimental and theoretical efforts at ORNL are highlighted. The talk concludes with speculations on the short-and long-term impact of quantum information on cyber security.

Inlet and outlet teflon ball valves were fitted to the base of each incubation chamber and connected by Tygon hose to an external centrifugal pump, which flushed the chambers at regular intervals with fresh seawater. Incubations lasted a total of 24 h. The respirometer was used to investigate the primary production, at different depths, by the green alga Caulerpa taxifolia in the northern Mediterranean and by ≪micro-colonies≫ of the reef-building coral Stylophora pistillata in the northern Red Sea. These investigations indicated: (a) that C. taxifolia may satisfy a significant proportion of its basal metabolic requirement at depths greater than 25-30 m near Monaco by uptake of organic carbon from substrata via its subterranean rhizoids; and (b) that S. pistillata comprises 3 different depth (light) adapted strains in the Gulf of Aqaba.","","Algebra; Electrodes; Marine biology; Metabolism; Plastic parts; Pumps; Quantum electronics; Reefs; Sensors; Submersible respirometers; Underwater equipment","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE","Proceedings of the 1998 Oceans Conference.

The photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) sensors, which measure the photon flux density of radiation in the spectral interval from 400 to 700 nm, cannot measure the spectral components, including the photon flux density of red light band and the photon flux density of blue light band, the light in these two bands are widely used in plant lighting. Facility agriculture, especially plant factories with artificial lighting, needs these data and their ratios by far, so a type of multichannel PPFD sensor is designed to solve these problems. First, we expound the design principle, circuit, and structure of the sensor, and calibrate the unregulated sensors by a standard PPFD sensor (PQS-1, Holland) under the calibration device constructed by controller based on DMX512 protocol. The test results show that the sensor's average variance is 0.9956, which approximates the ideal linear response value 1. Meanwhile, we make a black opaque soft plastic anticrosslight sleeve using three-dimensional printing to solve the problem of crosslight on the sidewall of the filter, which let the crosslight error coefficient of the red and blue channels reduced by an order of magnitude and approached 0. Finally, we designed a set of light environment control systems, which can autocontrol the PPFD and light quality ratios, and a set of supplemental lighting systems, which can control the daily light integral, based on the sensors. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","calibration; light environment control; multichannel; photosynthetic photon flux density sensor; plant factory","3D printers; Agriculture; Artificial photosynthesis; Calibration; Lighting; Photons; Plant life extension; Quality control; Urban growth; Daily light integrals; Design and application; Facility agricultures; Light environment; Measurement of plant growths; Multichannel; Photosynthetic photon flux densities; Plant factory; Plants (botany)","","","","","Fuyang Municipal Government; Fuyang Normal University Horizontal Project; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (WK6030000084); Major Science and Technology Project of Hainan Province, (16030701093)","The article was based on the paper of the 2018 Asian Optical Conference, which has been included in the SPIE Digital Library.

Therefore, some systems will have aspects which can only be simulated by cunning modeling. On the other hand, a simulation may conveniently do extra-systemic processing that would be impractical in a real system. We illustrate with examples from our quantum computing simulator, QCSim. We model the [3,1] Hamming code in the presence of random bit flip or generalized amplitude damping noise, and calculate the expected result in one simulation run, as opposed to, say, a Monte Carlo simulation, and keep the original state to compute the chance of successful transmission, too. We also model the BB84 protocol with eavesdropping and random choice of basis and compute the chance of information received faithfully. Finally, we present our simulation of teleportation as an example of the trade-off between complexity of the simulation model and complexity of simulation inputs and as an example of modeling measurements and classical bits.","BB84; Modeling; Quantum computing; Quantum simulation; Teleportation","Acoustic noise; Algorithms; Computer simulation; Computer software; Error analysis; Information services; BB84; Information systems; Quantum computing; Quantum simulation; Teleportation; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Viamontes G.F., Markov I.L., Hayes J.P., Improving gate-level simulation of quantum circuits, Quantum Information Processing, (2004); Niwa J., Matsumoto K., Imai H., General-purpose Parallel Simulator for Quantum Computing, (2002); Black P.E., Lane A.W., QCSim, (2004); Stillerman M., A design language for quantum computing, Tech.

We next discuss how quantum statistical testing can be used to verify device behavior as well as detect device bias.

At the development and application of such automated systems, the focus is on measuring the accuracy of temperature and humidity soil, whereas to determine the level of illumination used sensors, that measure the total illumination or Photosynthetic Active Radiation (400-700 nm) with error up to 20%. Under conditions of insufficient photon flux density, even at the optimal moisture level and temperature in the greenhouse, fruiting and crop yields may not achieve high performance. This article proposes a greenhouse lighting control system in which the LI-200R Pyranometer and LI-190R-BL Quantum Sensor measure not only total illumination from the wavelength of 400–1000 nm, but also PPFD from a wavelength of 400–700 nm. Light Sensor Amplifier provides an increase in the source signal of the measuring sensors and reduces their measurement error to 1%. The applied SMART Connectivity Platform ESP8266 Version ESP 07 is more robust to interference and ensures the transfer of measured data to the server. Created software application for smartphones with Android OS, ensures remote user access to the database via the Internet for remote control and analysis of climatic indicators in the greenhouse. The proposed illumination control system in the greenhouse contributes to the improvement of precision farming. © BEIESP.","Greenhouse; Internet of Things; Light Sensor Amplifier; Quantum Light Sensor","","","","","","National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, NASU","Author I.

Some of our computationally challenging problems of interest include: the capability for rapid image processing, rapid optimization of logistics, protecting information, secure distributed simulation, and massively parallel computation. Currently, one important problem with quantum information processing is that the implementation of quantum computers is difficult to realize due to poor scalability and great presence of errors. Therefore, we have supported the development of Quantum eXpress and QuIDD Pro, two quantum computer simulators running on classical computers for the development and testing of new quantum algorithms and processes. This paper examines the different methods used by these two quantum computing simulators. It reviews both simulators, highlighting each simulators background, interface, and special features. It also demonstrates the implementation of current quantum algorithms on each simulator. It concludes with summary comments on both simulators.","Command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; Information dominance; Information systems; Quantum computing; Quantum information science","Computer simulation; Data processing; Image processing; Information systems; Logistics; Optimization; Problem solving; Information dominance; Paradigm shift; Quantum algorithms; Quantum information science; Quantum computers","","","","","","","Viamontes G.F., Rajagapolan M., Markov I.L., Hayes J.P., High-Performance Simulation of Quantum Computation Using QuIDDs, 6th Intl.

Quantum technologies offer new means for carrying out fast computation as well as secure communication, using primitives that exploit peculiar characteristics of quantum physics. While building quantum computing devices remains a challenge, the area of quantum communication and cryptography has been successful in reaching industrial applications. In particular, recently, plans for building quantum internet have been put into action and expected to be launched by 2020 in the Netherlands. Quantum internet uses quantum communication as well as quantum entanglement along with classical communication. This makes design of software platform for quantum networks very challenging and a daunting task. Seamless design and testing of platforms for quantum software, thus, becomes a necessity to develop complex simulators for this kind of networks. In this short paper, we argue that using coordination models such as Reo can significantly simplify the development of software applications for quantum internet. Moreover, formal verification of such quantum software becomes possible, thanks to the separation of concerns, compositionality, and reusability of Reo models. This paper introduces an extension of a recently developed simulator for quantum internet (SimulaQron) by incorporating Reo models extended with quantum data and operations, along with classical data. We explain the main concepts and our plan for implementing this extension as a new tool: SimulaQ(reo)n. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Quantum communication; Quantum information; Quantum networks; Reo Coordination Model","Application programs; Computer software reusability; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Reusability; Software design; Software testing; Verification; Classical communication; Coordination model; Quantum computing devices; Quantum Information; Quantum network; Quantum technologies; Separation of concerns; Software applications; Quantum communication","","","","","School of Computer Science, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences; School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, SCS; Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences, IPM","Funding text 1: The first author is supported in part by a grant from the School of Computer Science, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Iran.; Funding text 2: Keywords: Quantum communication · Quantum information Quantum networks · Reo Coordination Model The first author is supported in part by a grant from the School of Computer Science, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Iran.","Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2000); Dahlberg A., Wehner S., SimulaQron-A simulator for developing quantum internet software, Quantum Sci.

Each tripartite system is independently excited with the entangled photons (signal and idler). The interesting point is that by manipulation of the system in the right condition, the microwave cavities modes separately affected by the entangled photons can be entangled. The entangled microwave photons play the same role as the triplet-singlet states present in the bird's navigational system. The key point in the design of the quantum sensor is that the entanglement between microwave photons can be strongly affected by the external magnetic field. In fact, this is the criterion employed by the quantum sensor to sense the magnetic field intensity and the direction. To analyze the system, the canonical quantization (or microscopic) method is used to determine the sensor's Hamiltonian, and also the system dynamics equations of motions are analytically derived using Heisenberg-Langevin equations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Entanglement; Quantum sensor; Quantum theory; Radical pair; Robin; Simulation","Equations of motion; Geomagnetism; Hamiltonians; Magnetic fields; Microwave sensors; Photons; Canonical quantization; Entangled photons; External magnetic field; Geomagnetic fields; Heisenberg-Langevin equations; Interesting points; Magnetic-field intensity; Navigational systems; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Ritz T., Quantum effect in biology: bird navigation, Procedia Chem., 3, pp. 262-275, (2011); Hore P., The Quantum Robin, IN-DEPTH, (2021); Arndt M., Juffmann T., Vedral V., Quantum physics meets biology, HFSP, 3, pp. 386-400, (2009); Hiscock H.G., Worster S., Kattnig D.R., Steers C., Jin Y., Manolopoulos D.E., Mouritsen H., Hore P.J., The quantum needle of the avian magnetic compass, PNAS, 113, pp. 4634-4639, (2016); Wiltschko W., Munro U., Ford H., Wiltschko R., Red light disturbs magnetic orientation of migratory birds, Nature, 364, pp. 525-527, (1993); Wiltschko W., Traudt J., Gunturkun O., Prior H., Wiltschko R., Robins have a magnetic compass in both eyes, Nature., 419, pp. 467-470, (2002); Zhang Y., Berman G.P., Kais S., Sensitivity and entanglement in the avian chemical compass, Phy.

At the same time advantage, from the users' perspective, is that they are no longer required to use biometric memorizing credentials. Fingerprinting has been in use since the 19th century in determining identity. Because users' biometric templates are stored within any system, their security becomes extremely sensitive, as theft or simple copying of the biometric can compromise the identity of all users enrolled in the system. This paper presents a quantum-based biometric fingerprint encryption method. The method uses an adapted Novel Enhanced Quantum (NEQR) model to store biometric fingerprint in quantum systems and proposes quantum techniques of Confusion and Feistel algorithm to encryption it.

In this work, six types of terminated hexagonal diamond (100) surfaces for shallow NV centers are proposed, and structural and electronic properties are investigated by structure prediction method combined with first-principles calculation. In these structures, only fluorine and oxygen terminated surfaces (F-hex and α-O-hex) have positive electron affinity of 3.00 and 2.85 eV, respectively, no surface-related states and electron spin noise, indicating that the F-hex and α-O-hex surfaces could be a promising host of NV center. We make further inspections by placing an NV center ∼12 Å below the surfaces, and the results confirm that the surfaces have little effect on the defect states of NV center. Consequently, the F-hex and α-O-hex surfaces are prospective candidates for NV-based quantum sensors. © 2023","","Diamonds; Electron affinity; Electronic properties; Fluorine; Magnetic moments; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Diamond surfaces; First principle calculations; Hexagonal diamond; Negatively charged; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Prediction methods; Quantum sensors; Structural and electronic properties; Structure prediction; Chemical modification","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Jilin Province, (YDZJ202301ZYTS274)","This work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Jilin Province (Grant No. YDZJ202301ZYTS274 ).

We design schemes that allow one to achieve optimal scaling and are immune to noise sources with a different spatial dependence than the signal. This is achieved by using a sensor array of spatially separated sensors and constructing a multi-dimensional decoherence free subspace. While in the Fisher regime with sharp prior and multiple measurements only the spectral range Δ is important, in single-shot sensing with broad prior the number of available energy levels L is crucial. We study the influence of L and Δ also in intermediate scenarios, and show that these quantities can be optimized separately in our setting. This provides us with a flexible scheme that can be adapted to different situations, and is by construction insensitive to given noise sources.  © 2020 The Author(s).

Informally, the theorem states that if the observational divergence between two quantum states ρ, σ is small, then there is a quantum state ρ′ close to ρ in trace distance, such that ρ′ when scaled down by a small factor becomes a substate of σ. We present new proofs of this theorem. The resulting statement is optimal up to a constant factor in its dependence on observational divergence. In addition, the proofs are both conceptually simpler and significantly shorter than the earlier proof. © 2012 IEEE.","Observational divergence; quantum information theory; relative entropy; smooth relative min-entropy; substate theorem","Information theory; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Min-entropy; Observational divergence; Quantum information theory; Relative entropy; substate theorem; Entropy","","","","","Army Research Office, ARO; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, CIFAR; Government of Ontario; Government of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Industry Canada; Mitacs","Manuscript received March 30, 2011; revised December 30, 2011; accepted December 31, 2011.

In particular, the use of decoherence-free subspaces for error mitigation and the use of error correction codes in practical quantum computing increases the number of qubits beyond the number considered in the simple treatments often given the literature. When concatenated quantum codes are used for these purposes, self-similar quantum states arise that are fractal in character. Recently, a definition of fractal states for discrete systems in quantum information processing was introduced to capture and formalize this phenomenon. Examples of fractal quantum states for quantum communications and quantum computing applications are shown to accord with this definition. The possibility of fractal quantum states of linear qubit arrays appearing in relation to quantum phase transitions is also noted here. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.","Entangled photons; Phase transitions; Quantum coding; Quantum computing","","","","","","","","Jaeger G., Phys.

Patenting trends of such technologies are an indicator of the pace of innovation at the invention stage. Empirical studies looking at the real-world patenting activity can provide valuable evidence to help assess and guide policy proposals related to intellectual property rights (IPRs), innovation and governance of quantum technologies. In this paper, we report the results of a study designed to map the patent landscape of quantum technologies. We evaluate the patenting trends over the last 20 years to determine: (1) the growth of quantum technology patents, (2) the technology breakdown and classification of patenting activity, (3) the choice of priority patent office, (4) the types of patent claims and strategies, (5) the subject matter of recently awarded patents, (6) the top patent owners, (7) the dominant patent portfolios, and (8) the geographical distribution of this patent activity. Based on our patent landscape study, we critically examine if patent protection is posing a problem in the technical field of quantum technologies. We show how quantum patent disclosure is moving us to an emerging quantum information commons, gradually reinforcing the public domain. Additionally, we examine the innovation and policy implications of these results in the broader context of quantum innovation initiatives, market competition, the patent/trade secret interface, and governance of quantum technologies. © 2022, The Author(s).","Patent landscape; Quantum computing; Quantum cryptography; Quantum innovation; Quantum investment; Quantum IP; Quantum technologies","","","","","","Novo Nordisk Fonden, NNF, (NNF17SA027784)","The research was supported, in part, by a Novo Nordisk Foundation Grant for a scientifically independent Collaborative Research Programme in Biomedical Innovation Law (grant No. NNF17SA027784).

The key ethical questions are as follows: Does quantum computing pose new ethical problems, or are those raised by quantum computing just a different version of the same ethical problems raised by other technologies, such as nanotechnologies, nuclear plants, or cloud computing? In other words, what is new in quantum computing from an ethical point of view? The paper aims to answer these two questions by (a) developing an analysis of the existing literature on the ethical and social aspects of quantum computing and (b) identifying and analyzing the main ethical problems posed by quantum computing. The conclusion is that quantum computing poses completely new ethical issues that require new conceptual tools and methods. © 2023, The Author(s).","Computing; Cryptography; Ethics; Quantum technologies","","","","","","","","Ayoade O., Rivas P., Orduz J., Artificial intelligence computing at the quantum level, Data, 7, 28, pp. 1-12, (2022);

The trapped photons are confined by the potential well, which introduce the motion of photons in a fiber Bragg grating affected by multi perturbations. The external perturbations are defined as series of nonlinear parametric in terms of potential energy. This investigation is developed by using the nonlinear couple mode equations and under Bragg resonance condition where the initial frequency of the light, ω0 is the same value as the Bragg frequency, ωB. The results show that the higher perturbation series represents the potential well is much indifferent of equilibrium. In applications, the perturbation can cause the trapped photons instability which introduces the escape photons from the potential well. The applications such as entangled photon source and quantum sensors can be performed.","","Fiber Bragg gratings; Nonlinear equations; Quantum entanglement; Bragg resonance; Couple mode equation; Entangled photons; External perturbations; Initial frequency; Multi-perturbation; Perturbation series; Quantum sensors; Photons","","","","","","","Kashyap R., Fiber Bragg Gratings, (1999); Malomed B.A., Soliton Management in Periodic Systems, (2006); Winful H.G., Marburger J.H., Garmire E., Appl.

Here, we report on the development of a triple-mode broadband waveguide bandpass filter (BPF), which uses a high-Q metallic cavity to transfer the microwave and excite the diamond NV spin ensembles. This BPF provides a more efficient, low-loss, uniform, and broadband microwave signal, as well as a closed space for the NV-quantum sensor. The developed BPF exhibits a large fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 34.8% with a center frequency of 2.87 GHz, and this leads to improve the measurable static magnetic field range up to 5.36 × 10−2 T. Experimental results show that the sensitivity is improved to 14.67 μT/Hz1/2 compared to the patch antenna of 188.49 μT/Hz1/2, that is usually used in the conventional diamond NV-based quantum sensors. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","diamond NV centers; magnetic field sensor; quantum sensor; waveguide bandpass filter","Bandwidth; Diamonds; Magnetic fields; Magnetic sensors; Magnetometers; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Microwave filters; Microwave sensors; Nanocrystals; Slot antennas; Waveguide filters; Accurate measurement; Center-based; Diamond nitrogen-vacancy center; Dynamic range; Magnetic fields sensors; Measurement sensitivity; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Quantum sensors; Waveguide bandpass filter; Bandpass filters","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12174347 62105294)","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 12174347 62105294 Funding information ","Nam J., Lee W., Jung E., Jang G., Magnetic navigation system utilizing a closed magnetic circuit to maximize magnetic field and a mapping method to precisely control magnetic field in real time, IEEE Trans Ind Electron, 65, 7, pp. 5673-5681, (2018); Vollinger C., Todesco E., Identification of assembly faults through the detection of magnetic field anomalies in the production of the LHC dipoles, IEEE Trans Appl Supercond, 16, 2, pp. 204-207, (2006); Li H., Shrestha A., Heidari H., Le Kernec J., Fioranelli F., Magnetic and radar sensing for multimodal remote health monitoring, IEEE Sens J., 19, 20, pp. 8979-8989, (2019); Yang B., Dong Y., Hu Z.-Z., Liu G.-Q., Wang Y.-J., Du G.-X., Noninvasive imaging method of microwave near field based on solid-state quantum sensing, IEEE Trans Microw Theory Tech., 66, 5, pp. 2276-2283, (2018); Yang B., Dong M.-M., He W.-H., Et al., Using diamond quantum magnetometer to characterize near-field distribution of patch antenna, IEEE Trans Microw Theory Tech., 67, 6, pp. 2451-2460, (2019); Chen G.-B., He W.-H., Dong M.-M., Zhao Y., Du G.-X., Nitrogen-vacancy axis orientation measurement in diamond micro-crystal for tunable RF vectorial field sensing, IEEE Sens J., 20, 5, pp. 2440-2445, (2020); Chen G.-B., Gu B.-X., He W.-H., Guo Z.-G., Du G.-X., Vectorial near-field characterization of microwave device by using micro diamond based on tapered fiber, IEEE J Quantum Electron, 56, 3, pp. 1-6, (2020); Hu Z., Yang B., Dong M., Liu Y., Wang Y., Du G., Optical sensing of broadband RF magnetic field using a micrometer-sized diamond, IEEE Trans Magn, 55, 3, pp. 1-4, (2019); Cardoso V.F., Francesko A., Ribeiro C., Banobre-Lopez M., Martins P., Lanceros-Mendez S., Advances in magnetic nanoparticles for biomedical applications, Adv Healthc Mater, 7, 5, (2018); Schmitt S., Gefen T., Sturner F.M., Et al., Submillihertz magnetic spectroscopy performed with a nanoscale quantum sensor, Science, 356, 6340, pp. 832-837, (2017); Yuan H., Yang X., Zhang N., Et al., Frequency-tunable and circularly polarized microwave resonator for magnetic sensing with NV ensembles in diamond, IEEE Sens J., 20, 15, pp. 8477-8482, (2020); Taylor J.M., Cappellaro P., Childress L., Et al., High-sensitivity diamond magnetometer with nanoscale resolution, Nat Phys, 4, 10, pp. 810-816, (2008); Zhang N., Yuan H., Zhang C., Et al., Microwave field uniformity impact on DC magnetic sensing with NV ensembles in diamond, IEEE Sens J, 19, 2, pp. 451-456, (2019); Pham L.M., Magnetic Field Sensing with Nitrogen-Vacancy Color Centers in Diamond.

This paper focuses on the application of this technique to achieve reliable communication in an ever-evolving and increasingly vulnerable environment. Designers of cryptosystems have three basic objectives; designing cryptographic algorithms that adequately scramble the target data, developing strong encryption keys to lock and unlock the algorithm, and securely distributing the keys between communicating devices. The advance of quantum computing technologies threatens to expose the world's most prolific key method overnight. Though quantum computing is not yet a reality, the basic principles have been proven in laboratories. Furthermore, quantum computing has been shown to be especially suited for computations of complex mathematic equations; such as distilling the private keys from the public keys used in public key infrastructures (PKI). In this environment, it's comforting to know that the most advanced technology in the broad field of quantum communications just happens to be a new method of creating and distributing encryption keys. This technology is referred to as quantum key distribution (QKD). QKD technologies shift the current paradigm on two plains. The first is that it uses quantum principles, rather than conventional means, for distributing keys between devices. The quantum principles guarantee the key can not be intercepted during transmission without alerting the users of a compromise. The second shift is derived from the fact that encrypted data can not be intercepted today and decrypted at a later date when the computing power exists to crack the code. This shift is dependant on the use of a combination of QKD and one-time pad. Because of the quantum principles that QKD relies on, when a key is successfully created and shared, it can not be cracked using intercepted data. The keys are derived from a convergence of random operations conducted at the sender and receiver stations. Indeed, neither the sender nor the receiver can determine what the key will be until the entire process is completed. As a piece of our security infrastructure, QKD significantly raises our security posture. This paper explains the application of quantum principals used to enable QKD systems. ©2008 IEEE.","","Applications; Communication; Light measurement; Military communications; Public key cryptography; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum theory; Technology; Advanced technologies; Basic principles; Computing power; Crypto systems; Cryptographic algorithms; Encrypted datum; Encryption keys; Private keys; Public keys; Public-key infrastructures; Quantum communications; Quantum computing; Quantum key distributions; Random operations; Receiver stations; Reliable communications; Security infrastructures; Keys (for locks)","","","","","","","Bennett C.H., Brassard G., Quantum cryptography: Public-key distribution and coin tossing.

These advances in quantum information science have had a considerable impact on the development of standoff sensors such as quantum radar. In this paper we analyze the theoretical performance of low-brightness quantum radar that uses entangled photon states. We use the detection error probability as a measure of sensing performance and the interception error probability as a measure of stealthiness. We compare the performance of quantum radar against a coherent light sensor (such as lidar) and classical radar. In particular, we restrict our analysis to the performance of low-brightness standoff sensors operating in a noisy environment. We show that, compared to the two classical standoff sensing devices, quantum radar is stealthier, more resilient to jamming, and more accurate for the detection of low reflectivity targets. © 2015 SPIE.","Quantum Information; Quantum Radar; Quantum Sensing; Quantum Sensors; Stealth Sensing","Information science; Luminance; Optical radar; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Radar; Radar equipment; Classical information processing; Detection error probability; Quantum Information; Quantum information science; Quantum Sensing; Quantum sensors; Stealth Sensing; Theoretical performance; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2000); Lanzagorta M., Uhlmann J., Quantum Computer Science, (2008); Didomenico L.D., Lee H., Kok P., Dowling J.P., Quantum interferometric sensors, Proceedings of SPIE Quantum Sensing and Nanophotonic Devices, (2004); Dowling J.P., Quantum optical metrology - The lowdown on high-NOON states, Contemporary Physics, 49, 2, (2008); Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Quantum enhanced positioning and clock synchronization, Nature, 412, (2001); Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Quantum-enhanced measurements: Beating the standard quantum limit, Science, 306, (2004); Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Quantum metrology, Phys.

By coincidence, 1905 was also the year that Lenard's measurements of the photoelectric effect were explained by Albert Einstein, who postulated that light waves could also be thought of as particles, discrete packets or quanta of energy now known as photons. The advances in rocketry and aviation have been stunning with the fundamental understanding of the quantum world having given the transistor and Moore's Law, the Internet and cell phones. Remarkably, these two independent factors from the worlds of large and small may be multiplied.

When planning and setting up such an experiment, the following must be taken into consideration: type of sensor to be used, how many measurements (in space and time) to use, and the statistical reliability of the collected data. To answer these and other questions, an experiment was carried out in Scotland using containers-grown stands of three poplar clones. The transmittance data were not normally distributed. The mean and variance of hourly, daily and weekly values of transmittance, calculated using tube solarimeters or quantum sensors, were computed. The relationship between the mean and the variance, for both types of sensor, showed a good fit to the model S2 = aχ(b) (where S2 is the variance, χ is the mean, and a and b are equation parameters). The parameters of this equation have been used to determine the required sample size for the two types of sensor on the basis of the standard error of the mean. The reliability of the average transmittance does not change when considering the hourly, daily or weekly data. The standard error stabilises with 2-3 tube solarimeters and with 3-5 quantum sensors. There are high standard errors only with very high transmittance using the quantum sensors. The average seasonal ratio between the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and solar irradiance (SI) of the incoming radiation was 1.90 mmolJ-1 . With closed canopies (LAI > 2.5), the transmittance measured with tube solarimeters was as much as 4-8 times higher than that measured with quantum sensors. As a consequence, the fraction of intercepted solar irradiance was lower than the fractional PPFD interception.

With so much on the line, it is imperative to find a new quantum encryption method before quantum technology catches up with current cryptography. This study examines one of the very few experiments on encryption that has already been conducted and analyzes the results of the tests run on the IBM Cloud Server. It attempts to recreate the sample experiment and make comprehensive adjustments for a real-world environment. This study also looks at the possible application of quantum public key encryption and the theoretical importance of quantum key distribution. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Encryption algorithm; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum encryption; Quantum key distribution; Quantum public key encryption","Public key cryptography; Quantum computers; Qubits; Cloud servers; Encryption algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum encryption; Quantum public keys; Quantum technologies; Real world environments; Quantum cryptography","","","","","","","Quantum Computing Report: Where Qubits Entangle with Commerce, (2018); Cartlidge E., Europe’se 1 Billion Quantum Flagship Announces Grants, (2018); Chen S., Quantum Cryptography Explained; Furuta A., One thing is certain: Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is not dead, Scientific American, (2012); Grimes R., The Quantum Break is Coming Will You Be Ready?; Harrow A.W., Hassidim A., Lloyd S., Quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations, Phys.

However, the direct integration of an SPS into on-chip photonic systems remains challenging due to low coupling efficiencies between the SPS and the photonic circuitry that often involve size mismatch and dissimilar materials. Here we develop an adjoint topology optimization scheme to design high-efficiency couplers between a photonic waveguide and an SPS in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The algorithm accounts for fabrication constraints and SPS location uncertainty. First, a library of designs for the different positions of the hBN flake containing an SPS with respect to a Si3N4 waveguide is generated, demonstrating an average coupling efficiency of 78%. Then, the designs are inspected with a dimensionality reduction technique to investigate the relationship between the device geometry (topology) and the performance. The fundamental, physics-based intuition gained from this approach could enable the design of high-performance quantum devices.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.","on-chip; single-photon emitter; topology optimization","Dissimilar materials; Efficiency; Elementary particle sources; Particle beams; Photons; Quantum communication; Silicon; Silicon compounds; Waveguides; Coupling efficiency; On chips; On-chip photonics; Performance; Quantum applications; Quantum communication systems; Quantum sensors; Single photon emitters; Single-photon source; Topology optimisation; III-V semiconductors","","","","","DSO Extreme Optics and Imaging, (HR00111720032); National Quantum Information Science Research Center; Quantum Science Center; National Science Foundation, NSF, (2029553-ECCS); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; Office of Science, SC","This work is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science through the Quantum Science Center (QSC), a National Quantum Information Science Research Center (developing ML algorithms), the DARPA/DSO Extreme Optics and Imaging (EXTREME) Program (HR00111720032) (O.Y., A.V.K., Z.A.K., TO techniques), and National Science Foundation award 2029553-ECCS.","O'Brien J.L., Furusawa A., Vuckovic J., Photonic Quantum Technologies, Nat.

The advantages stem from advanced system miniaturization, thus, requiring far less sample volume while allowing for complex functionality, increased reproducibility, and high throughput. However, LOC applications necessitate extensive sensor miniaturization to leverage these inherent advantages fully. Atom-sized quantum sensors are highly promising to bridge this gap and have enabled measurements of temperature, electric and magnetic fields on the nano- to microscale. Nevertheless, the technical complexity of both disciplines has so far impeded an uncompromising combination of LOC systems and quantum sensors. Here, we present a fully integrated microfluidic platform for solid-state spin quantum sensors, like the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Our platform fulfills all technical requirements, such as fast spin manipulation, enabling full quantum sensing capabilities, biocompatibility, and easy adaptability to arbitrary channel and chip geometries. To illustrate the vast potential of quantum sensors in LOC systems, we demonstrate various NV center-based sensing modalities for chemical analysis in our microfluidic platform, ranging from paramagnetic ion detection to high-resolution microscale NV-NMR. Consequently, our work opens the door for novel chemical analysis capabilities within LOC devices with applications in electrochemistry, high-throughput reaction screening, bioanalytics, organ-on-a-chip, or single-cell studies. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Microfluidics; Reproducibility of Results; Biocompatibility; Lab-on-a-chip; Microfluidics; Miniature instruments; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Quantum theory; fluorine 18; nanodiamond; nitrogen; polyetheretherketone; High-throughput; Lab-on-a-chip applications; Lab-on-a-chip systems; Life-sciences; Microfluidic platforms; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Physical science; Quantum sensors; Science tools; Sensing platforms; Article; biocompatibility; bright field microscopy; chemical analysis; chemical vapor deposition; computer aided design; confocal microscopy; electric field; equipment design; fluorescence intensity; fluorescent lighting; fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance; Fourier transform; high performance liquid chromatography; high throughput screening; magnetic field; microfluidic analysis; microwave irradiation; non invasive procedure; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; optomechanics; photodegradation; process control; quantitative analysis; quantum chemistry; software; solid state; spatial analysis; temperature; three dimensional printing; validation study; microfluidics; reproducibility; Chemical detection","","fluorine 18, 13981-56-1; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; polyetheretherketone, 31694-16-3","Fusion360, Autodesk, United States","Autodesk, United States","Fraunhofer Lighthouse Project Quantum Magnetometry; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Research Council, ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (412351169, EXC 2089/1 – 390776260, EXC-2111 390814868); Horizon 2020, (948049)","This work was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No 948049) and by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) – 412351169 within the Emmy Noether program.

In this paper, a novel method to estimate the parameter of the freeinduction-decay signal based on the adaptive internal model (AIM) controller is proposed and it is verified by the free induction decay data collected from the gyro prototype. In the proposed methods, the AIM con troller can provide estimates of the FID signal, such as the amplitude, the frequency, and the relaxation time. The feasibility of the scheme is proven by theoretical analysis and the reliability of the method is verified by the test results.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The computing technique demands quantum computers that have been theoretically proved for getting computational speed-ups and proposes quick solution for existing classical problems. The problem of searching an element over an indexed based unstructured database is intentionally taken, that can be efficiently solvable by linear search algorithm over classical computers, and the algorithm at worst requires O(N) time to search deterministic existence of an element. Relatively, Grover’s quantum search algorithm guarantees to find probabilistic existence of such element at worst O(√N) time over quantum computers, and can be proven to get the quadratic speed-up.

This work explores the use of regression to infer a machine-learned point estimate of an unknown parameter. Although the analysis is necessarily frequentist - relying on repeated estimates to build up statistics - the authors clarify that this machine-learned estimator converges to the Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimator (subject to some regularity conditions). When the number of training measurements is large, this is identical to the well-known maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE), and using this fact, the authors argue that the Cramér-Rao sensitivity bound applies to the mean-square error cost function and can therefore be used to select optimal model and training parameters. The machine-learned estimator inherits the desirable asymptotic properties of the MLE, up to a limit imposed by the resolution of the training grid. Furthermore, the authors investigate the role of quantum noise in the training process and show that this noise imposes a fundamental limit on the number of grid points. This manuscript paves the way for machine-learning to assist the calibration of quantum sensors, thereby allowing maximum-likelihood inference to play a more prominent role in the design and operation of the next generation of ultra-precise sensors.  © 2021 Author(s).","","","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (820419)","We would like to thank V.

An algorithm utilizing symmetric key is presented, taking into account the fundamental principles of both classical and quantum computing. Messages in this algorithm consist of blocks, each of which consists of 32 bits of space. To begin with, the process of classical encryption is divided into two processes, rotation process and permutation process, all controlled by the key that determines the order in which the bits of the block message are rotated. Secondly, encrypting block messages in bits is converted to qubits. In the third step, the quantum bits are applied to a certain quantum gate, such as Not(x), Control Not (CNot) and Toffoli (T), to change the value of that quantum bits. Fourth, in order to create non-orthogonal ciphertext states, Pauli gates are utilized and controlled by a key in the second stage. Eavesdroppers cannot detect the encryption of messages that have changed from orthogonal states to non-orthogonal states because quantum computing is based on quantum mechanical principles. It has been demonstrated that the proposed algorithm increases message space. In addition, various algorithm analyses have proven the improved strength of our proposed algorithm against various attacks, including brute force attacks. © 2023 IEEE.","Pauli gates; Quantum Bits; Quantum computing; Quantum Cryptography; Quantum Gates; Toffoli Gate; Trojan Horse Attack","Logic gates; Malware; Quantum cryptography; Qubits; Non-orthogonal; Orthogonal state; Pauli gate; Quantum bit; Quantum Computing; Quantum encryption algorithm; Quantum gates; Real- time; Toffoli gates; Trojan Horse attacks; Process control","","","","","","","Bennett C., Brassard G., Quantum cryptography: Public-key distribution and coin tossing, Proceedings of ieee International Conference on Computers, Systems and Signal Processing, Bangalore, India, pp. 175-179, (1984); Vajner D.A., Rickert L., Gao T., Kaymazlar K., Heindel T., Quantum communication using semiconductor quantum dots, Advanced Quantum Technologies, 5, 7, (2022); Pirandola S., Andersen U.L., Banchi L., Berta M., Bunandar D., Colbeck R., Englund D., Gehring T., Lupo C., Ottaviani C., Pereira J.L., Advances in quantum cryptography, Advances in optics and photonics, 12, 4, pp. 1012-1236, (2020); Wang S., Yin Z.Q., He D.Y., Chen W., Wang R.Q., Ye P., Zhou Y., Fan-Yuan G.J., Wang F.X., Chen W., Zhu Y.G., Twin-field quantum key distribution over 830-km fibre, Nature Photonics, 16, 2, pp. 154-161, (2022); Cao Y., Zhao Y., Wang Q., Zhang J., Ng S.X., Hanzo L., The evolution of quantum key distribution networks: On the road to the qinternet, IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 24, 2, pp. 839-894, (2022); Zhou N., Zeng G., Nie Y., Xiong J., Zhu F., A Novel Quantum Block Encryption Algorithm Based on Quantum Computation, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 362, 2, pp. 305-313; Moussa K.H., Abd-Elbaset M., Abouelseoud Y., Elkamchochi H.M., A symmetric key dynamic gates encryption algorithm based on quantum computing, 2021 38th National Radio Science Conference (NRSC), 1, pp. 109-116, (2021); Moussa K.H., Abd-Elbaset M., Abouelseoud Y., Elkamchochi H.M., A New 16 Bit Symmetric Key Quantum Encryption Algorithm Based On Dynamic Pauli Gates, 2021 International Telecommunications Conference (ITC-Egypt), pp. 1-4, (2021); Deraz S.A., Soliman M.A., Moussa K.H., Enhancing the Performance of MIMO-NOMA Systems Based on Peak to Peak Data Rate Difference, 2021 International Telecommunications Conference (ITC-Egypt), pp. 1-4, (2021); Deraz S.A., Rizk M.R., Shaaban S., Moussa K.H., Performance Analysis of MIMO-NOMA Systems Based on Dynamic User Pairing Scheme, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1447, 1, (2020); Coopmans T., Knegjens R., Dahlberg A., Maier D., Nijsten L., De Oliveira Filho J., Papendrecht M., Rabbie J., Rozpdek F., Skrzypczyk M., Wubben L., Netsquid, a network simulator for quantum information using discrete events, Communications Physics, 4, 1, (2021); Patterson B., Quantum Gates; Nguyen Q.C., Tran L.N., Nguyen H.Q., Qsun: an open-source platform towards practical quantum machine learning applications, Machine Learning: Science and Technology, 3, 1, (2022); Hilbe J.M., Mathematica 5.2: a review, The American Statistician, 60, 2, pp. 176-186, (2006); Touchette H., Dumai P., QuCalc-The quantum computation package for Mathematica, (2000)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 International Telecommunications Conference, ITC-Egypt 2023","18 July 2023 through 20 July 2023","Alexandria","191626","","979-835032606-2","","","English","Int.

Reliable simulation models are required to design complex circuits, but CMOS transistor electrical characteristics at cryogenic temperatures substantially deviate from the behavior at room temperature, and no standard physics-based model exists for cryo-CMOS devices. To circumvent those limitations, this paper proposes the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and an associated training (extraction) procedure that automatically generates cryo-CMOS device models directly from experimental data. A device model for the DC characteristics of 40-nm CMOS transistors over a wide range of bias conditions, device geometries and temperatures from 4 K to 300 K has been generated and used to simulate voltage-reference circuits over a wide temperature range (4 K - 300 K). The potential application to dynamic/high-frequency circuits is demonstrated by enhancing the basic model with ANN-based nonlinear multi-terminal capacitive elements to simulate a ring oscillator. Preliminary results showing a good match between simulations and experiments demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed approach.  © 2021 IEEE.","CMOS integrated circuits; cryo-CMOS; cryogenics; quantum computing; quantum sensing; semiconductor device models","CMOS integrated circuits; Cryogenics; Neural networks; Oscillators (electronic); Timing circuits; Transistors; Artificial neural network modeling; CMOS devices; CMOS transistors; Cryo-CMOS; Cryogenic temperatures; Device modelling; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Quantum computers","","","","","Intel Corporation","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank the legal teams of the TU Delft and Keysight Technologies, and Keysight Laboratories and Keysight Quantum Engineering Solutions organizations for encouragement and support.

So far, the world has not found a substitute product, so wire rope detection has become an essential part of daily maintenance. As a non-destructive testing technology, magnetic flux leakage (MFL) testing technology can quickly and efficiently detect the wire rope without damaging its structure. Conventional hall sensors and TMR sensors are used to collect magnetic field signals in traditional magnetic flux leakage detection. Diamond N-vacancy (NV) color center, a new quantum sensor developed in recent years, greatly improves sensitivity and detection accuracy compared with the traditional magnetic sensor. This work will build a measurement system with an NV color center quantum sensor, then detects the magnetic leakage field caused by defects on the surface of the wire rope and judge the location of defects through signal processing and drawing images. According to the experimental results, the system can accurately detect the defects of steel wire rope and provide a new method for industrial safety. © 2022 IET Conference Proceedings.

It works as a form of quantum computation to improve the security and confidentiality of quantum programs. Although some quantum encryption schemes have been discussed, any quantum asymmetric scheme based on quantum obfuscation is not still proposed. In this paper, we construct an asymmetric encryption scheme based on quantum point function, which applies the advantages of quantum obfuscation to quantum public-key encryption. As a start of the study on applications of quantum obfuscation to asymmetric encryption, our work will be helpful in the future quantum obfuscation theory and will therefore promote the development of quantum computation. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Quantum asymmetric encryption; Quantum computation; Quantum obfuscation","Public key cryptography; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Asymmetric encryption; Quantum encryption; Quantum point; Quantum public keys; Computation theory","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61571024, 61971021); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFC1000307)","Acknowledgments.

The Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET’s) are created based on the principles of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks. The VANET’s are the subset of MANET’s which are used for intelligent transport systems. The VANET’s are network of vehicles which warn the passengers, drivers and vehicles regarding road safety and traffic congestion besides infotainment. The On Board Unit (OBU), Road Side Unit (RSU), and Trusted Authority make up the VANETs (TA). Experience with the VANET varying network density brought on by fast moving automobiles. The network may face frequent or irregular node disconnections when there is heavy traffic or even bad weather. In such circumstances, the V2I infrastructure may provide the nodes with the appropriate guidance. Vast computational processing resources are integrated into VANETs to give real-time vehicle location, speed, and route information. In VANETs, security concerns and issues are particularly important because they guarantee the safety of both drivers and passengers. This is necessary to ensure safety and protection when designing crucial algorithms. Availability, authentication, integrity, secrecy, nonrepudiation, pseudonymity, privacy, mobility, data and location verification, access control, and key management difficulties are just a few of the security challenges that VANETs face. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC.","On board unit (OBU); Quantum advantage; Quantum internet; Road side unit (RSU); Trusted authority (TA); VANET security; Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs)","","","","","","","","Cacciapuoti A.S., Caleffi M., Tafuri F., Cataliotti F.S., Gherardini S., Bianchi G., Quantum internet: Networking challenges in distributed quantum computing, IEEE Network, 34, 1, pp. 137-143, (2020); Bhaskar M.K., Riedinger R., Machielse B., Levonian D.S., Nguyen C.T., Knall E.N., Park H., Englund D., Loncar M., Sukachev D.D., Lukin M.D., Experimental demonstration of memory-enhanced quantum communication, Springer Nat, 580, 7801, pp. 60-64, (2020); Aguado A., Lopez V., Lopez D., Peev M., Poppe A., Pastor A., Folgueira J., Martin V., The engineering of software-defined quantum key distribution networks, IEEE Commun.

This advantage, however, relies on refined data postprocessing, assessed based on the variance of the estimated parameter. When Bayesian techniques are adopted, more elements become available for assessing the quality of the estimation. Here we adopt generalized classical Cramér-Rao bounds for looking in detail into a phase-estimation experiment performed with quantum light. In particular, we show that the third-order absolute moment can give a superior capability in revealing biases in the estimation, compared to standard approaches. Our studies point to the identification of an alternative strategy that brings a possible advantage in monitoring the correct operation of high-precision sensors. © 2020 American Physical Society.","","Bayesian techniques; Data post-processing; Estimated parameter; High-precision; Phase estimation; Quantum metrology; Quantum resources; Quantum sensors","","","","","Dipartimenti di Eccellenza, (B81I18001170001); Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; Amaldi Research Center, ARC","We thank A.

Such scheme allows suppressing Stark shift components when a certain pumping light polarization is applied. As a result, long-term stability of a quantum sensor increases. However, when low-frequency (LF) and microwave fields are attached to a single vapor cell a coherence circulation in hyperfine structure of alkali atoms takes place. Physical origin of this effect is associated with the so called ""dressed"" atom theory, when atom is ""dressed"" by LF field. It yields in multiphoton absorption and resonance frequency shift. First estimates for this shift based on density matrix evolution formalism are provided in the paper. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Atoms; Magnetometers; Multiphoton processes; Pumping (laser); Hyperfine structure; Long term frequency stability; Long term stability; Multi-photon absorption; Pumping light polarization; Quantum sensors; Resonance frequency shift; Self-oscillating; Atom lasers","","","","","","","Ermak S.V., Zimnitskij P.V., Smolin R.V., Semenov V.V., Tech.

Photothermal heating can limit the utility of NV- center nanodiamonds, especially under high laser irradiances4-6. A composite of nanodiamonds with NV- defects and ytterbium-doped cubic sodium yttrium fluoride (Yb:α-NaYF4 or NaYF) could offset the photothermal heating of nanodiamonds by the anti-Stokes fluorescence cooling of Yb3+ ions7. We present a novel preparation method for generating a NV- diamond NaYF composite material based on a hydrothermal synthesis approach. Particle size was determined to be 230 ± 90 nm by SEM, and DLS data show a permanent connection between nanodiamonds and NaYF. Nanodiamonds are observed on the surfaces of NaYF materials. Nanodiamonds may also be incorporated within the body of individual NaYF grains, however the question of whether nanodiamonds are fully incorporated into the host NaYF material remains to be answered. The temperatures of host material and NV- defects are accessed using mean fluorescence wavelength shifts and Debye-Waller factor thermometry respectively. The obtained temperature changes with increasing 1020 nm irradiance show good agreement. Two data sets showed photothermal heating of around 10 and 13 K at 6.3 MW/cm2. Increased particle smoothness and sizes could lead to coolable composite materials.

Quantum error correction (QEC) can enhance sensitivity by suppressing decoherence, but it has a side effect: it biases a sensor's output in realistic settings. If unaccounted for, this bias can systematically reduce a sensor's performance in experiment, and also give misleading values for the minimum detectable signal in theory. We analyze this effect in the experimentally motivated setting of continuous-time QEC, showing both how one can remedy it, and how incorrect results can arise when one does not. © 2022 American Physical Society.","","Continuous time systems; Error correction; Continous time; Decoherence; Detectable signal; Quantum error corrections; Quantum sensors; Sensor output; Sensor performance; Side effect; Time quantum; article; Quantum theory","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; National Center of Competence in Research Quantum Science and Technology, NCCR QSIT, (51NF40–160591, PZ00P2_186040)","I. R. thanks D.

We consider the performance of W-type quantum states as the probe for the networked quantum sensors. Providing an analytic result on the metrological performance of networked quantum sensors, we attain a criterion for the enhancement of the distributed phase estimations in networked quantum sensors. This insight enables us to compare the metrological power of certain quantum states. We also consider schemes that enable the generation and utility of such entangled quantum probes in practical settings. © 2022 American Physical Society.","","Gravity waves; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Biological measurement; Gravitational-wave detection; Metrological performance; Nanoscale microscopy; Performance; Phase-estimation; Quantum probe; Quantum sensors; Quantum state; W-Types; Probes","","","","","Qatar National Research Fund, QNRF","This research was supported by the project NPRP No. 13S-0205-200258 of the Qatar National Research Fund.","Tse M., Yu H., Kijbunchoo N., Fernandez-Galiana A., Dupej P., Barsotti L., Blair C., Brown D., Dwyer S., Effler A., Phys.

There is a need for wide spectral-bandwidth photon pairs (for high-resolution sensing) with high brightness (for fast sensing). Here, the generation of photon-pairs with flexible spectral-bandwidth even using single-frequency, continuous-wave diode laser enabling high-precision, real-time sensing is showed. Using 1-mm-long periodically-poled KTP crystal, degenerate, photon-pairs with spectral-bandwidth of 163.42±1.68 nm are produced resulting in a HOM-dip width of 4.01±0.04 (Formula presented.) m to measure a displacement of 60 nm, and sufficiently high brightness to enable the measurement of vibrations with amplitude of 205 ± 0.75 nm and frequency of 8 Hz. Fisher-information (FI) and maximum likelihood estimation enables optical delay measurements as small as 4.97 nm with precision (Cramér–Rao bound) and accuracy of 0.89 and 0.54 nm, respectively, therefore showing HOM sensing capability for real-time, precision-augmented, in-field quantum sensing applications. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","Cramér–Rao bound; Fisher information; Hong–Ou–Mandel interference; nonlinear optics; parametric processes; quantum optics; quantum sensing","Bandwidth; Fisher information matrix; Luminance; Nonlinear optics; Photons; Quantum optics; Crame Rao bounds; Fisher information; Frame-rate; High brightness; Hong-Ou-mandel interferences; Parametric process; Photon pairs; Quantum sensing; Spectral bandwidth; Video frame; Maximum likelihood estimation","","","","","","","Pirandola S., Bardhan B.R., Gehring T., Weedbrook C., Lloyd S., Nat.

In particular, these spin defects have shown promise as sensors for temperature, pressure, and static magnetic fields. However, their short spin coherence time limits their scope for quantum technology. Here, we apply dynamical decoupling techniques to suppress magnetic noise and extend the spin coherence time by two orders of magnitude, approaching the fundamental T 1 relaxation limit. Based on this improvement, we demonstrate advanced spin control and a set of quantum sensing protocols to detect radiofrequency signals with sub-Hz resolution. The corresponding sensitivity is benchmarked against that of state-of-the-art NV-diamond quantum sensors. This work lays the foundation for nanoscale sensing using spin defects in an exfoliable material and opens a promising path to quantum sensors and quantum networks integrated into ultra-thin structures. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","boron; quantum dot; boron; noise; quantum mechanics; Article; benchmarking; controlled study; magnetism; radiofrequency","","boron, 7440-42-8","","","NQSTI; National Quantum Science and Technology Institute; NextGenerationEU, (2022-RTDA-4445); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (412351169, RI 3319/1-1); Università di Bologna, UNIBO, (2022, EXC-2111 390814868, Strategy-EXC 2089/1-390776260); Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Wissenschaft und Kunst, STMWK","R.R. and D.B.B. would like to thank Dr. Steffen Glaser for stimulating discussions.

We introduce quantum enhanced protocols to directly measure any (scalar) field with a specific spatial dependence by placing sensors at appropriate positions and preparing a spatially distributed entangled quantum state. Our scheme has optimal Heisenberg scaling and filters out noise with different spatial dependence than the signal. We provide states, spatial sensor configurations, and protocols to achieve optimal scaling. We explicitly demonstrate how to measure coefficients of spatial Taylor and Fourier series, and show that our approach can offer an exponential advantage as compared to strategies that do not make use of entanglement between different sites.  © 2020 authors.","","Fourier series; And filters; Distributed sensing; Heisenberg; Noisy environment; Nonlocal; Quantum state; Spatial dependence; Spatial sensors; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Nat.

Designing an instrument to fly on a satellite requires particular attention to a number of aspects for the instrument hardware, which are inherent to space missions. To arrive at a viable mission and spacecraft design, the science performance requirements and instrument needs have to be analyzed, drivers for the mission design need to be identified and numerical simulations of measurement performance have to be run. This iterative process of maximizing the science return while optimizing the instrument and spacecraft designs will be illustrated with examples from a study of the fundamental physics mission STE-QUEST - comprising atom interferometry and clock comparisons - carried out at the European Space Agency. © 2015 Proceedings of the 50th Rencontres de Moriond - 2015 Gravitation: 100 years after GR.

The free-space quantum communication can be extended to ground-to-satellite or satellite-satellite quantum communication and can be used in near-Earth communication as well. One of the main advantages of the usage of space for future quantum communication is the loss-free and distortion-free optical communication. The main element of the free-space quantum communications is a quantum or a classical channel. There are many quantum error coding algorithms which are based on some redundancy. In our paper we show how a given type of error can be corrected with certain probability without any knowledge about the communication channel.

Examples of a photon interacting with linear systems of mirrors and beamsplitters are simulated. Nonlinear simulations of the interaction of three photons resulting in photon momentum entanglement is presented. The modeling presented here is more general than the classical linear optics. The wavefunction is expanded in Fock states. Fock states cannot be represented by classical modeling and therefore, the results of our modeling can in general represent phenomena in both the linear and nonlinear cases which cannot be modeled by classical linear optics.

Besides challenging demands on alignment precision, and thermo-mechanical durability, we specifically address ultra-high vacuum (UHV) compatibility of our integration technologies and optical components. A prototype design of an UHV-compatible, crossed beam optical dipole trap setup and its application within a cold atomic quantum sensor is described. First qualification efforts on adhesive micro-integration technologies are presented. These tests are conducted in application-relevant geometries and material combinations common for micro-integrated optical setups. Adhesive aging will be investigated by thermal cycling or gamma radiation exposure. For vacuum compatibility testing, a versatile UHV testing system is currently being set up, enabling residual gas analysis and measurement of total gas rates down to 5•10-10mbar l/s at a base pressure of 10-11 mbar, exceeding the common ASTM E595 test. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.","Adhesive; Cold atoms; Environmental testing; Micro-integration; Miniaturized optical setups; Outgassing; Qualification; Quantum sensors; Residual gas analysis; Ultra-high vacuum","Adhesives; Atoms; Degassing; Environmental testing; Integration; Integration testing; Small satellites; Ultrahigh vacuum; Cold atoms; Micro integration; Optical set-up; Qualification; Quantum sensors; Residual gas analysis; Photonic integration technology","","","","","German Space Agency DLR; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi, (DLR 50WM1648)","This work is supported by the German Space Agency DLR with funds provided by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy under grant number DLR 50WM1648.","Oi D.K.L., Et al., Nanosatellites for quantum science and technology, Contemporary Physics, 58, 1, pp. 25-52, (2017); Wicht A., Et al., Narrow linewidth diode laser modules for quantum optical sensor applications in the field and in space, Proc.

Quantifying intercepted PAR requires accurate measurements of total incident PAR above canopies and direct beam and diffuse PAR components. While some regional data sets include these data, e.g. from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program sites, they are not often applicable to local research sites because of the variable nature (spatial and temporal) of environmental variables that influence incoming PAR. Currently available instrumentation that measures diffuse and direct beam radiation separately can be cost prohibitive and require frequent adjustments. Alternatively, generalized empirical relationships that relate atmospheric variables and radiation components can be used but require assumptions that increase the potential for error. Our goal here was to construct and test a cheaper, highly portable instrument alternative that could be used at remote field sites to measure total, diffuse and direct beam PAR for extended time periods without supervision. The apparatus tested here uses a fabricated, solar powered rotating shadowband and other commercially available parts to collect continuous hourly PAR data. Measurements of total incident PAR had nearly a one-to-one relationship with total incident radiation measurements taken at the same research site by an unobstructed point quantum sensor. Additionally, measurements of diffuse PAR compared favorably with modeled estimates from previously published data, but displayed significant differences that were attributed to the important influence of rapidly changing local environmental conditions. The cost of the system is about 50% less than comparable commercially available systems that require periodic, but not continual adjustments. Overall, the data produced using this apparatus indicates that this instrumentation has the potential to support ecological research via a relatively inexpensive method to collect continuous measurements of total, direct beam and diffuse PAR in remote locations. © 2015 Cruse et al.","","Carbon Cycle; Ecology; Photosynthesis; Radiometry; Solar Energy; Sunlight; Article; cost; diffuse photosynthetically active radiation; direct beam photosynthetically active radiation; equipment design; mathematical analysis; photosynthetically active radiation; point quantum sensor; radiation detector; radiation measurement; radiological parameters; remote sensing; rotating shadowband system; sensor; total photosynthetically active radiation; carbon cycle; devices; ecology; economics; evaluation study; photosynthesis; physiology; procedures; radiation response; radiometry; solar energy; sunlight","","","","","National Science Foundation, (DEB-1038759); U.S. Department of Agriculture, (WIS01419); Directorate for Geosciences, GEO, (1038759)","","Bondeau A., Smith P.C., Zaehle S., Schaphoff S., Lucht W., Et al., Modelling the role of agriculture for the 20th century global terrestrial carbon balance, Glob Chang Biol, 13, pp. 679-706, (2007); Kucharik C.J., Evaluation of a Process-Based Agro-Ecosystem Model (Agro-IBIS) across the U.S. Corn Belt: Simulations of the Interannual Variability in Maize Yield, Earth Interact, 7, pp. 1-33, (2003); Dai Y., Dickinson R., Wang Y.-P., A Two-Big-Leaf Model for Canopy Temperature, Photosynthesis, and Stomatal Conductance, Am Meteorol Soc, 17, pp. 2281-2299, (2004); Chen J., Liu J., Cihlar J., Goulden M., Daily canopy photosynthesis model through temporal and spatial scaling for remote sensing applications, Ecol Modell, 124, pp. 99-119, (1999); Campbell G., Norman J., An Introduction to Environmental Biophysics, (1998); De Pury D.G.G., Farquhar G.D., Simple scaling of photosynthesis from leaves to canopies without the errors of big-leaf models, Plant, Cell Environ, 20, pp. 537-557, (1997); Alton P.B., North P.R., Los S.O., The impact of diffuse sunlight on canopy light-use efficiency, gross photosynthetic product and net ecosystem exchange in three forest biomes, Glob Chang Biol, 13, pp. 776-787, (2007); Givnish T.J., Adaptation to Sun and Shade: A Whole-plant Perspective, Aust J Plant Physiol, 15, pp. 63-92, (1988); Knohl A., Baldocchi D.D., Effects of diffuse radiation on canopy gas exchange processes in a forest ecosystem, J Geophys Res, 113, (2008); Norman J., Scaling processes between leaf and canopy levels, Scaling Physiological Processes: Leaf to Globe., pp. 41-76, (1993); Liu B.Y.H., Jordan R.C., The interrelationship and characteristic distribution of direct, diffuse and total solar radiation, Sol Energy, 4, pp. 1-19, (1960); Jacovides C.P., Boland J., Asimakopoulos D.N., Kaltsounides N.A., Comparing diffuse radiation models with one predictor for partitioning incident PAR radiation into its diffuse component in the eastern Mediterranean basin, Renew Energy, 35, pp. 1820-1827, (2010); Reindl D.T., Beckman W.A., Duffie J.A., Diffuse fraction correlations, Sol Energy, 45, pp. 1-7, (1990); Bristow K.L., Campbell G.S., On the relationship between incoming solar radiation and daily maximum and minimum temperature, Agric for Meteorol, 31, pp. 159-166, (1984); Twomey S., Aerosols, clouds and radiation, Atmos Environ, 25, pp. 2435-2442, (1991); Wesely M., Simplified techniques to study components of solar radiation under haze and clouds, J Appl Meteorol, 21, pp. 373-383, (1982); Michalsky J.J., Perez R., Stewart R., LeBaron B.A., Harrison L., Design and development of a rotating shadowband radiometer solar radiation/daylight network, Sol Energy, 41, pp. 577-581, (1988); Ross J., Sulev M., Sources of errors in measurements of PAR, Agric For Meteorol, 100, pp. 103-125, (2000); Grant R.H., Shadow-band corrections for photosynthetically-active radiation under clear and overcast conditions, Agric For Meteorol, 87, pp. 213-222, (1997); Brock T.D., Calculating solar radiation for ecological studies, Ecol Modell, 14, pp. 1-19, (1981); Average Weather for Madison, Wisconsin, USA, (2013); Monthly Climate Madison WI: 1, (2013); Spitters C.J.T., Toussaint H.A.J.M., Goudriaan J., Separating the diffuse and direct component of global radiation and its implications for modeling canopy photosynthesis part i.

They apply a new kind of optics based on matter waves. Today, atomic clocks are the standard for time and frequency measurement at the highest precisions. Inertial and rotational sensors using atom interferometers have already shown similar potential for replacing state-of-the-art sensors in other fields. With BoseEinstein condensates, also referred as atom lasers, the traditional experiments with atom interferometers can be greatly improved. Testing of fundamental principles, studies of atomic properties, applications as inertial sensors, and measurements of fundamental constants can benefit from the brightness (intensity and small momentum spread) of these coherent sources. In addition, the coherence properties of condensates may allow BEC-based atom interferometers to approach the Heisenberg detection limit. This corresponds to a measurement precision which scales like 1/N for N atoms and not like 1/√N as for independent measurements on N atoms. We present here the recent progress toward the acheivement of new coherent atomic sources, i.e. atom lasers, that will be use in space-based atom interferometers. We introduce new concepts of atom accelerometers and gyrometers that take advantage of the high collimation and coherence properties of atoms lasers and report on the development of a 0-g coherent atom interferometer (ICE) that will be used to test the ultimate performances of atom accelerometers in space. © 2007 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Atom interferometry; Atom laser; Bose-Einstein condensates","","","","","","","","","P.

This scientific direction is currently relevant, since it is related to the problem of security and data protection in current information and communication networks. The article is devoted to quantum cryptography; it describes the development of quantum protocols as quantum key distribution systems. Grounded on the laws of quantum mechanics, the elaboration of modifications of secure data transfer protocols is shown. The authors considered the best-known protocol to be BB84 of quantum key distribution; a more modern modification of this protocol is BB84 Info-Z. Comparative analysis of these has also been carried out. It has been established that the BB84-Info-Z quantum protocol works more efficiently than BB84 since its lower error threshold allows the interceptor to obtain much less information about the secret key. The authors put forward a new idea to improve the BB84 protocol (which has been quite outdated for almost 40 years), due to the increase in modern requirements for quantum cryptography protocols. The modification is called CSLOE-2022. It enables significant intensification of cryptographic strength and the entanglement degree of the interceptor (cryptanalyst), which greatly complicates the very possibility of intercepting information. The ultimate goal of the CSLOE-2022 modification is to complicate the eavesdropping process so much that it can be considered completely useless for an attacker in terms of wasting time and resources. The modification allows exceeding the known speed limit of key generation without repeaters since it uses two sources, the phases of which, in addition to the hundreds of kilometers of fiber between them, are very difficult to stabilize. Comparison of the protocols by working distance showed that for BB84, this distance does not exceed 70 km; for BB84-Info-Z it is similar, at no more than 70 km, and the modification of CSLOE-2022 proposed by the authors theoretically allows increasing the working distance of the quantum protocol to 511 km (7.3 times). © 2022 by the authors.","error threshold; modification of the quantum protocol BB84; quantum cryptography; quantum key distribution; quantum protocol","","","","","","","","Bennett C.H., Brassard G., Quantum Cryptography: Public Key Distribution and Coin Tossing, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computers, Systems and Signal Processing; Aiello C.D., Hirose M., Cappellaro P., Composite-pulse magnetometry with a solid-state quantum sensor, Nat.

Using entanglement for quantum enhancement will allow us to construct the next generation of sensors that can approach the fundamental limits of precision allowed by quantum physics. However, determining how state-of-the-art sensing platforms may be used to converge to these ultimate limits is an outstanding challenge. Here we merge concepts from the field of quantum information processing with metrology, and successfully implement experimentally a programmable quantum sensor operating close to the fundamental limits imposed by the laws of quantum mechanics. We achieve this by using low-depth, parametrized quantum circuits implementing optimal input states and measurement operators for a sensing task on a trapped-ion experiment. With 26 ions, we approach the fundamental sensing limit up to a factor of 1.45 ± 0.01, outperforming conventional spin-squeezing with a factor of 1.87 ± 0.03. Our approach reduces the number of averages to reach a given Allan deviation by a factor of 1.59 ± 0.06 compared with traditional methods not using entanglement-enabled protocols. We further perform on-device quantum-classical feedback optimization to ‘self-calibrate’ the programmable quantum sensor with comparable performance. This ability illustrates that this next generation of quantum sensor can be used without previous knowledge of the device or its noise environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Physics; detection method; experimental study; operations technology; optimization; performance assessment; precision; sensor; sensory system; accuracy; Article; information processing; mathematical computing; mathematical model; mean squared error; process optimization; quantum mechanics; physics","","","","","ELQO; IQI GmbH; US ARO, (W911NF-16-1-0070, W911NF-20-1-0007); National Science Foundation, NSF; Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-19-1-7044, I04426, RSF/Russia 2019); Simons Foundation, SF, (651440); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (731473, 817482, 820495, 840450, 884471); Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ODNI; Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, IARPA; European Commission, EC, (H2020-FETFLAG-2018-03); Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (F7109); Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG, (872766); Universität Innsbruck, uibk","Funding text 1: We acknowledge funding from the EU H2020-FETFLAG-2018-03 under grant agreement no. 820495.

The 3D arrayed VSi’s were created by proton beam writing using different ion (proton) energies. The photoluminescence (PL) mapping analysis indicates that the features of the luminescent spot, such as size and depth, can be estimated by a Monte Carlo simulation (SRIM). This suggests that assessment at any location within the SiC device can be realized using VSi quantum sensors. Luminescent spots, with depth ranging 4-60 µm, showed similar ODMR spectra including contrast which indicates that similar sensor sensitivity can be realized. This suggests that the 3D arrayed VSi implemented in this work can act as quantum sensor elements with uniform sensitivity in SiC devices. © 2020 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.","Color center; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Pn diode; Proton beam writing; Three-dimensional array","Luminescence; Magnetic resonance; Monte Carlo methods; Silicon carbide; Mapping analysis; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Proton beam writing; Quantum sensors; Sensor sensitivity; SiC devices; Silicon vacancies; Threedimensional (3-d); Vanadium compounds","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (17H01056, 18H03770); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (JPMXS0118067395)","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI 17H01056 and 18H03770, MEXT Quantum Leap Flagship Program (MEXT Q-LEAP) Grant Number JPMXS0118067395.

Two main obstacles prevent the extension of laser cooling techniques to a variety of atomic species and molecules. The first is associated with technical difficulties in creating cw laser light in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectral range - the absence of those laser sources prevents laser cooling of simple atoms such as hydrogen, deuterium, and antihydrogen. The second obstacle is associated with complex energy level structure of many atoms and almost all molecules - it permits decay of an excited state into a number of lower-lying states that can be widely separated in energy, which makes laser cooling of such species inefficient and experimentally very challenging. © 2019 IEEE","","Atom lasers; Atoms; Continuous wave lasers; Excited states; Molecules; Continuous-wave lasers; Energy level structures; High-precision spectroscopy; Laser cooling of atoms; Laser sources; Laser-cooling techniques; Optical frequency combs; Optical-frequency combs; Quantum sensors; Simple++; Laser cooling","","","","","","","Kielpinski D., Laser cooling of atoms and molecules with ultrafast pulses, Phys.

The problem is depicted as a two-player game, where the two players, i.e. the host and the participant share an entangled three-qubit quantum state between them. The quantum state of three qubits is closely knit with the fact that behind which door would one expect the prize of the game to be. The two players are part of one team as they share a quantum communication channel amongst them by sharing the entangled state as a quantum resource. The article shows a unique way of utilizing the effectiveness and entanglement features of the W state as a source of communication in disguise for solving the Monty Hall problem. It is shown that by sharing the W state, the players always win the prize. Moreover, since Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum technology is the need of the hour, the effects of decoherence are also observed on the winning prospects of the game. © 2022 IEEE.","host; Monty Hall; noise; participant; quantum; qubits; winning chances","Quantum communication; Quantum Hall effect; Qubits; Decoherence effects; Host; Monty hall; Noise; Participant; Quantum; Quantum Computing; Quantum state; W state; Winning chance; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2010); Feynman R.P., Simulating physics with computers, Int J Theor Phys, 21, pp. 467-488, (1982); Horodecki R., Horodecki P., Horodecki M., Horodecki K., Quantum entanglement, Rev.

Constrained by the obstacles of building practical quantum computers, quantum circuit simulation has become a feasible approach to develop and verify quantum algorithms. Although there are many quantum simulators available, they either achieve low performance on CPUs, or limited simulation scale (e.g., number of qubits) on GPUs due to limited memory capacity. Therefore, we propose dgQuEST, a novel acceleration method that utilizes hybrid CPU-GPU memory hierarchies for large-scale quantum circuit simulation across multiple nodes. dgQuEST adopts efficient memory management and communication schemes to leverage the distributed CPU and GPU memories for accelerating large-scale quantum simulation. Our evaluation demonstrates that dgQuEST achieves an average speedup of 403 × compared to QuEST on quantum circuit simulation with 32 qubits, and scales to quantum circuit simulation with 35 qubits on two GPU nodes, far beyond the state-of-the-art implementation HyQuas can support. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Distributed GPU acceleration; Memory and communication optimization; Quantum simulation","Graphics processing unit; Program processors; Quantum chemistry; Quantum optics; Qubits; Timing circuits; Communication optimization; Distributed GPU acceleration; GPU accelerations; Large-scales; Memory hierarchy; Memory optimization; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum simulations; Circuit simulation","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62072018); State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment, SKLSDE, (SKLSDE-2021ZX-06); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), (2020YFB1506703)","Acknowledgements.

Although quantum sensors offer potentially better sensitivity than classical sensors, they are bulky and often require cooling to cryogenic temperatures or operation in vacuum. Here we propose a technical realization of a quantum sensor for magnetic field detection based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, which is compatible with miniaturization and offers potential sub-picotesla sensitivity. The miniaturization is based on recently developed electric readout of the NV center electron spin resonance. Our engineering platform allows to use diamond chip as a portable magnetic field sensor. We have designed and tested a miniaturized prototype and describe all key components for technical miniaturization. We achieved a power consumption down to 3.5 W, a weight of the fully integrated sensor of only 27g and small dimensions of 45 x 25 x 25 mm including all driving and readout components. We have proved the chip functionality in vacuum and explored its thermal behavior. The system will be further used for on-board stratospheric balloon experiment. The miniaturized sensor we developed has potential applications in a wide range of fields including navigation, bio-signal measurement, material analysis or space weather monitoring and planetary observation.

The underpinning scientific principles of QT systems are largely developed, but for QT to fulfill its potenti Then orders of magnitude reduction in size, cost and power consumption of the enabling technologies is required. Stabilized laser systems are key ingredients of many quantum sensors. In many cases multiple lasers, each with specific wavelength, power and linewidth requirements, are needed for cooling, trapping, imaging and the clock references. In this paper we describe the design and packaging of a compact, frequency-stabilized 780nm laser module with integrated vapor reference cell. This stabilized source addresses the D2 transition of 87Rb that connects the ground and excited states, which is used for laser cooling, trapping and repumping in a rubidium interferometer. Component packaging techniques more normly employed in telecoms component packaging are utilized to minimize size and maximize stability. The resulting laser module lends itself to usage in applications in portable instruments outside of the lab. © 2019 Downloading of the abstract is permitted for person use only.","Laser cooling; Miniaturization; Quantum technologies; Stabilized laser; Telecoms packaging","Clocks; Laser cooling; Petroleum prospecting; Quantum cryptography; Surveying; Acceleration sensors; Enabling technologies; Miniaturization; Narrow linewidth lasers; Quantum technologies; Scientific principles; Scientific researches; Stabilized lasers; Packaging","","","","","","","Takamoto M., Hong F.-L., Higashi R., Katori H., An optic lattice clock, Nature, 435, (2005); Peters A., Chung K.Y., Chu S., High-precision gravity measurements using atom interferometry, Metrologia, 38, (2001); Geiger R., Meacute;noret V., Stern G., Zahzam N., Cheinet P., Battelier B., Villing A., Moron F., Lours M., Bidel Y., Bresson A., Detecting inerti effects with airborne matter-wave interferometry, Nature Communications, 2, (2011); Steck D.A., Rubidium 87 D Line Data, (2001); Buus J., Amann M.C., Blumenth D.J., Tunable laser diodes and related optic sources, Wiley-Interscience, pp. 79-106, (2006); Preston D.W., Doppler?free saturated absorption: Laser spectros&copy, American Journ of Physics, 64, 11, pp. 1432-1436, (1996); Hieta T., Vainio M., Moser C., Ikonen E., Extern-cavity lasers based on a volume holographic grating at norm incidence for spectros&copy in the visible range, Optics Communications, 282, 15, pp. 3119-3123, (2009)","W.

We present a dilation-based algorithm to simulate nonunitary operations using probabilistic quantum computing with only one ancilla qubit. We utilize the singular-value decomposition (SVD) to decompose any general quantum operator into a product of two unitary operators and a diagonal nonunitary operator, which we show can be implemented by a diagonal unitary operator in a one-qubit dilated space. While dilation techniques increase the number of qubits in the calculation, and thus the gate complexity, our algorithm limits the operations required in the dilated space to a diagonal unitary operator, which has known circuit decompositions. We use this algorithm to prepare random subnormalized two-level states on a quantum device with high fidelity. Furthermore, we present the accurate nonunitary dynamics of two-level open quantum systems in a dephasing channel and an amplitude-damping channel computed on a quantum device. The algorithm presented will be most useful for implementing general nonunitary operations when the SVD can be readily computed, which is the case for most operators in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing era. © 2022 American Physical Society.","","Computational complexity; Quantum optics; Qubits; Ancilla; Open quantum systems; Probabilistics; Quantum Computing; Quantum device; Quantum operators; Quantum state; Quantum state preparation; Unitary gates; Unitary operators; Singular value decomposition","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMR-2037783); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Basic Energy Sciences, BES, (CHE-2035876, DE-SC0019215)","This work is supported by the NSF RAISE-QAC-QSA, Grant No. DMR-2037783, and the Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Grant No. DE-SC0019215.

With the arrival of the quantum computation, both methods become vulnerable, thanks to its exponential-growing calculation capacity. To solve this lack of security, quantum physics nowadays offers us two satisfactory methods which have been proposed successfully from a theoretical point of view: the two non-commuting observables, based on the Bennet and Brassard protocol, and the quantum entanglement combined with the Bell's inequality theorem, based on the Ekert protocol. Since some experiments have demonstrated the viability of the conduction of free space quantum cryptography at the surface of the Earth, we propose that this could be a boost for secure ground-to-satellite or satellite-to-satellite communications. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Osbeck) were measured in the field during the growing season of 1977/78 to ascertain if, as in the leaf, stomata control photosynthesis and transpiration under changing environmental conditions. Measurements were made on 15 year old trees grown in a sandy loam soil and receiving either a dry or a wet treatment. Fruit diffusive conductance was measured with a modified water vapour diffusion conductance meter and gross photosynthesis was measured with a 14CO2 uptake meter. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was measured with a quantum sensor. Fruits exposed to light assimilated CO2 at a rate which was 25-50% of that assimilated by leaves. The uptake was dependent on fruit size, PAR, chlorophyll content, and on diffusive conductance of the fruit epidermis. Epidermal conductance showed a diurnal trend which was similar in shape to that of the leaf except in the late afternoon. Cuticular conductance of the fruit was calculated and ranged between 0.22 and 0.30 mm s-1. It was speculated that the CO2 uptake by the fruit could support the growth of flavedo cell layers when exposed to light. Dry soil caused an increase in the 14CO2 uptake by fruit possibly caused by the increased potential area of the stomatal opening per unit of fruit surface area. © 1980 Oxford University Press.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00220957","","JEBOA","","English","J.

Generically, the sensitivity of a quantum sensor consisting of N independent particles is proportional to N. However, interactions invariably occurring at high densities lead to a breakdown of the assumption of independence between the particles, posing a severe challenge for quantum sensors operating at the nanoscale. Here, we show that interactions in quantum sensors can be transformed from a nuisance into an advantage when strong interactions trigger a dissipative phase transition in an open quantum system. We demonstrate this behavior by analyzing dissipative quantum sensors based upon nitrogen-vacancy defect centers in diamond. Using both a variational method and a numerical simulation of the master equation describing the open quantum many-body system, we establish the existence of a dissipative first order transition that can be used for quantum sensing. We investigate the properties of this phase transition for two- and three-dimensional setups, demonstrating that the transition can be observed using current experimental technology. Finally, we show that quantum sensors based on dissipative phase transitions are particularly robust against imperfections such as disorder or decoherence, with the sensitivity of the sensor not being limited by the T2 coherence time of the device. Our results can readily be applied to other applications in quantum sensing and quantum metrology where interactions are currently a limiting factor. © 2018 American Physical Society.","","Quantum optics; Vacancies; First order transitions; High-density quantum; Nitrogen vacancies; Open quantum systems; Quantum many-body systems; Quantum technologies; Strong interaction; Variational methods; Numerical methods","","","","","Volkswagen Foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (SFB 1227)","We thank D. D. B.

The rate achieved using a linear chain of quantum repeaters equipped with quantum memories, probabilistic Bell state measurements (BSMs), and switches used for spatial multiplexing, but no quantum error correction, was shown to surpass the direct-transmission capacity. However, this rate still decays exponentially with the end-to-end distance, viz., R∼e-sαL, with s<1. We show that the introduction of temporal multiplexing - i.e., the ability to perform BSMs among qubits at a repeater node that were successfully entangled with qubits at distinct neighboring nodes at different time steps - leads to a subexponential rate-vs-distance scaling, i.e., R∼e-tαL, which is not attainable with just spatial or spectral multiplexing. We evaluate analytical upper and lower bounds to this rate and obtain the exact rate by numerically optimizing the time-multiplexing block length and the number of repeater nodes. We further demonstrate that incorporating losses in the optical switches used to implement time multiplexing degrades the rate-vs-distance performance, eventually falling back to exponential scaling for very lossy switches. We also examine models for quantum memory decoherence and describe optimal regimes of operation to preserve the desired boost from temporal multiplexing. Quantum memory decoherence is seen to be more detrimental to the repeater's performance over switching losses.  © 2021 American Physical Society.","","Error correction; Light transmission; Optical fiber communication; Optical fibers; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Time division multiplexing; Time switches; Bell-state measurements; Decoherence; Performance; Quantum memory; Quantum repeaters; Scalings; Spatial multiplexing; Temporal multiplexing; Time multiplexed; Time multiplexing; Optical switches","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1941583); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (SP0020412-PROJ0005188); Northwestern University, NU, (W31P4Q-13-1-0004); L3Harris Technologies, (A000483213)","P.D. and S.G. would like to acknowledge funding support from L3Harris Technologies, under Contract No. A000483213, to develop the detailed analysis of time-multiplexed quantum repeaters.

However, high-dimensional quantum gates are rarely investigated both theoretically and experimentally even that high-dimensional quantum systems exhibit remarkable advantages over two-level systems for some quantum information and quantum computing tasks. Here we experimentally demonstrate the four-dimensional X gate and its unique higher orders with the average conversion efficiency 93%. All these gates are based on orbital-angular-momentum degree of freedom (DoF) of single photons. Besides, a set of controlled quantum gates is implemented by use of polarization DoF.

Light intensity distribution on the canopy surface was estimated as a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) histogram using reflection images. Reflection images of the tomato canopy surface were acquired from three different directions using a digital camera through a blue-green band-pass filter. PPFD was measured at one point on the canopy by a quantum sensor simultaneously with imaging and was used for determining a regression model for calculating PPFD on leaves from image pixel values. The PPFD histograms estimated from the reflection images were compared with the histograms of actual PPFD determined by measuring all leaves in the target canopy surface using a quantum sensor. The histograms showed similar patterns, with the mean estimated values being close to the measured values. The pattern of the PPFD histograms estimated from the reflection images changed over time during the day. The changes in the mean values calculated from the estimated PPFD histograms corresponded to those in PPFD measured on the horizontal plane. These results suggest that reflection image-based estimation of PPFD distribution on a plant canopy surface can be used for simple evaluation of the light environment in a greenhouse. © ISHS 2012.","Digital camera; Light control; Light intensity distribution; Reflection image; Tomato canopy","","","","","","","","Atkinson C.J., Dodds P.A.A., Ford Y.Y., Miere J.L., Taylor J.M., Blake P.S., Paul N., Effects of cultivar, fruit number and reflected photosynthetically active radiation on Fragaria × ananassa productivity and fruit ellagic acid and ascorbic acid concentrations, Ann.

This paper presents the simulation for implementation of a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol BB84, the pioneering, and most basic and fundamental protocol. We use the quantum computing platform developed by IBM named as Qiskit for the simulation of the BB84 protocol, implementing it with and without an Eve eavesdropper for studying the relative outcomes. Recently, Qiskit is globally very popular for quantum simulations because it provide us the opportunity to simulate quantum logic circuit on classical computer as well as real quantum computers owned by IBM. As per our best knowledge, there is no any proposal published for quantum circuit by anyone for BB84 QKD. We performed experimentation on local as well as cloud simulators: 1) The ""qasm-simulator""was used as local machine simulator, and 2) The ""ibmqx2""simulator was used as IBM cloud quantum simulator. The outcome of local as well as IBM simulator with and without an eavesdropper, between the two parties involved in key exchange were recorded and presented in the results section.  © 2022 IEEE.","BB84 Protocol; Quantum Cryptography; Quantum Key Distribution; Qubits","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Quantum chemistry; Quantum optics; Qubits; Simulation platform; BB84 protocol; Computing platform; Eavesdroppe; Practical method; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Quantum logic; Quantum simulations; Quantum-key- distribution protocol; Secret communications; Quantum cryptography","","","","","","","Shor P.W., Algorithms for quantum computation: Discrete logarithms and factoring, Proc.-Annu.

A derivation of the closed form expression for the detection operator that is optimal subject to constraints is provided. The raising and lowering properties of the detection operator and its square are developed. The expectations of the optimal detection operator and its square are derived. The expression for the visibility, the maximum expectation of the optimal detection operator, is developed. From the expectation of the square of the detection operator and the visibility, the phase error and the minimum phase error for the detection operator are derived. The optimal resolution for the maximum visibility and minimum phase error are found. For the visibility, comparisons between PMMSs, LCMMS and N00N states are provided. For the minimum phase error comparisons between LCMMS, PMMSs, N00N states, separate photon states (SPSs), the shot noise limit (SNL), and the Heisenberg limit (HL) are provided. A representative collection of computational results illustrating the superiority of LCMMS when compared to PMMSs and N00N states is given. It is found for a resolution 12 times the classical result LCMMS has visibility 11 times that of N00N states and four times that of PMMSs. For the same case, the minimum phase error for LCMMS is 10.7 times smaller than that of PMMS and 29.7 times smaller than that of N00N states. © 2010 SPIE.","M and M states; N00N states; Quantum entanglement; Quantum imaging; Quantum interferometer; Quantum metrology; Quantum radar; Quantum sensors; Super resolution; Super sensitivity","Error detection; Interferometers; Optimization; Quantum optics; Radar; Radar imaging; Radar theory; Sensors; Visibility; Quantum imaging; Quantum interferometer; Quantum metrology; Quantum radar; Quantum sensors; Super resolution; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., MacCone L., Quantum-enhanced measurements: Beating the standard quantum limit, Science, 306, pp. 1330-11310, (2004); Lee H., Kok P., Dowling J.P., A quantum rosetta stone for interferometry, J.

Starting from the first two-photon experiment by Hong-Ou-Mandel [1], it has been shown that multiphoton interference lies at the heart of computational complexity in linear optical interferometers, the most notable example being provided by the Boson Sampling model [2]. This model corresponds to sampling from the evolution of n indistinguishable photons in a multimode linear network, and has been shown to be hard to simulate classicaly thus representing a promising route to experimentally reach the quantum advantage regime. It has been shown, however, that genuine multiparticle interference is necessary for high computational complexity. Hence, appropriate methods for detection of such feature should be developed since the complexity of problem prevents the application of trivial methods. © 2019 IEEE.","","","","","","","","","Hong C.K., Ou Z.Y., Mandel L., Measurement of subpicosecond time intervals between two photons by interference, Phys.

The analysis of the definitions of “quantum communications” available in the current legislation is carried out, their legal nature as a variety of information and digital technologies is determined. The legal concept of “quantum communications” is formulated. The current legislation in the field of quantum communications is analyzed. The main directions of legal regulation of quantum communications in Russia, the key problems that arise in this case are identified. The development of the Concept of regulatory legal regulation of the quantum communications industry in the Russian Federation is proposed. The analysis of the legal regulation of relations arising in connection with the use of quantum communications indicates a clear lack of methodological support for these processes, the absence of a unified approach to understanding what constitutes “quantum communications”, how it is necessary to develop Russian legislation to ensure the breakthrough introduction of quantum communications. An analysis of the regulation of the quantum communications industry in the world indicates that regulation at the level of strategies, concepts, road-maps and development programs is predominant in this process. An im-portant mechanism of state regulation of the development of quantum communications – the state financing of support for projects in the field of quantum communications. The authors have identified several approaches that have developed abroad to the regulation of quantum technologies, including quantum communications, at the level of strategic regulation. The key promising issues in the field of quantum communications that have found legal regulation in foreign countries, which can be applied in Russia, are identified. The key measures of state support for the quantum communications industry, which should find regulatory re-flection in the near future, are identified and systematized. © 2022, Russian Academy of Sciences.

In this work, the H/O/OH mixed terminations on hexagonal diamond (100) surfaces to host NV centers are investigated by first-principles calculations. Results indicate that H–O, O–OH, and H–O–OH mixed surfaces produce positive electron affinity with neither spin noise nor surface-related state. It is concluded that the surface-connected ether bonds should be maintained, and unconnected ether bonds should be avoided, preserving the shallow NV centers unaffected. Based on the surface stability analysis, we further confirm that the H–O surface has a higher possibility to be fabricated. Moreover, we make an intensive study by placing an NV center ∼12 Å from the hexagonal (100) surface, and the results elucidate that the H–O surface has no obvious effect on the defect states of the NV center. Therefore, we identify a combination of surface terminators that is a prospective candidate for NV-based quantum sensors. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","","Diamonds; Electron affinity; Ethers; Hydrogen; Oxygen; Diamond surfaces; Ether bond; First principle calculations; Hexagonal diamond; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Positive electron affinities; Quantum sensors; Sensing applications; Spin noise; Nitrogen","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Jilin Province, (YDZJ202201ZYTS650)","This work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Jilin Province (Grant No. YDZJ202201ZYTS650 ).

However, the small volume available for the systems and the short distances from the LED array necessary in these applications create several unique problems. The discrete LEDS are small and the spacing between the lamps results in significant irradiance variation on surfaces near the array. These irradiance variations make it difficult to use traditional hand-held sensors to measure light levels under the array accurately. The usefulness of rear projection video camera imaging is investigated for the analysis of uniformity of irradiance from an LED array. Irradiance measurements were taken at a high mounting height from the array using both a 400-700-nm quantum sensor and a video camera. Additionally, video images were recorded at different mounting heights from the array. The rear projection imaging technique was suitable for analyzing the irradiance from LED arrays. Comparison of the readings from the video image and the sensor suggests that there is a nonlinear relationship between video image reading and sensor value (R(2) = 0.884). These data also show that the average photosynthetically active radiation level (PAR) does not change as mounting height varies, but that the spatial uniformity of the PAR does increase as mounting height increases. These results are consistent with geometrical analyses of the system.","","Ecological Systems, Closed; Evaluation Studies; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Life Support Systems; Light; Lighting; Photons; Photosynthesis; Plants; Video Recording; NASA Discipline Life Support Systems; Non-NASA Center; article; comparative study; evaluation; growth, development and aging; illumination; image processing; instrumentation; light; microclimate; NASA Discipline Life Support Systems; Non-NASA Center; photon; photosynthesis; plant; radiation exposure; videorecording","","","","","","","","D.E.

Moreover, it is also required that the PLLs should have low noise and low jitter for high stability and fast settling time. These requirements seek low phase noise voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) with small variation in its gain (KVCO) within the desired tuning range. In this paper, we present a technique for designing a low phase noise VCO with low KVCO and small KVCO variation. To validate the proposed technique, an LC VCO has been designed and implemented in 0.18 μ m CMOS process and post layout simulation results are presented. The simulation results show that the proposed LC VCO achieves KVCO variation of ±3.82% in the frequency range of 2.75 - 2.94 GHz and exhibits a phase noise of -118.64 dBc/Hz at an offset of 1 MHz, while consuming 9 mW of power from a 1.8 V supply.  © 2022 IEEE.","KVCO variation; low phase noise; oscillator; quantum sensing; VCO","Circuit oscillations; Oscillistors; Phase locked loops; Phase noise; Gain variations; KVCO variation; Low-phase-noise; Microwaves frequency; Narrow bands; Nitrogen vacancies; Noise voltage; Quantum sensing; Sensing applications; Voltage-controlled-oscillator; Variable frequency oscillators","","","","","","","Ibrahim M.I., Foy C., Englund D.R., Han R., High-Scalability cmos Quantum Magnetometer With Spin-State Excitation and Detection of Diamond Color Centers, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, 56, 3, pp. 1001-1014, (2021); Kim D., Ibrahim M.I., Foy C., Trusheim M.E., Han R., En-Glund D.R., A CMOS-Integrated Quantum Sensor based on Nitrogen-Vacancy Centres, Nature Electron., 2, 7, pp. 284-289, (2019); Razavi B., Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits, (2001); Razavi B., RF Microelectronics, (1997); Luo J., Zhang L., Zhang L., Wang Y., Yu Z., A 24GHz Low Power and Low Phase Noise pll Frequency Synthesizer with Constant kvco for 60GHz Wireless Applications, Proc.

Producers and operators ought to be assumed to have limited resources readily available for calibration, and yet, they should be able to trust the devices. Neural networks are almost ubiquitous for similar tasks for classical sensors: here we show the applications of this technique to calibrating a quantum photonic sensor. This is based on a set of training data, collected only relying on the available probe states, hence reducing overhead. We found that covering finely the parameter space is key to achieving uncertainties close to their ultimate level. This technique has the potential to become the standard approach to calibrate quantum sensors. © 2019 American Physical Society.","","Atomic physics; Physics; Laboratory conditions; Parameter spaces; Quantum photonics; Quantum sensors; Real-world problem; Training data; Calibration","","","","","Dipartimenti di Eccellenza, (B81I18001170001); Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; Amaldi Research Center, ARC","We acknowledge support from the Amaldi Research Center funded by the Ministero dell’istruzione dell’università e della ricerca (Ministry of Education, University and Research) program “Dipartimento di Eccellenza” (CUP:B81I18001170001).

The fundamental component of our scheme is the quantum circuit (QC), a linear network that optimally distributes the squeezing generated at one of its inputs among the d MZIs, where d unknown parameters θ1, . . ., θd are then imprinted and the number of photons at the outputs finally measured. For any given linear combination of the parameters, we can optimize the QC and achieve sub-shot-noise sensitivity. Our parallel strategy, based on the mode-entanglement created by the QC, outperforms the rival and more common sequential strategy, in which the same unknown parameters are estimated independently. It also saturates the ultimate sensitivity bound, the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, in a relevant regime of parameters, thus constituting an optimal estimation method in that regime. © 2023 SPIE.","distributed quantum sensing; entanglement; interferometry; Quantum phase estimation","Linear networks; Parameter estimation; Quantum optics; Shot noise; Distributed quantum sensing; Entanglement; Estimation theory; Fundamental component; Linear combinations; Multiphases; Phase-estimation; Quantum circuit; Quantum phase estimation; Squeezed state; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Loudon R., Knight P.

SJSU is a Minority and Hispanic Serving Institution at the heart of Silicon Valley. Its engineering graduates have been the major workforce supply in the semiconductor industry in the last few decades. As quantum technology is becoming more and more prominent in the industry, it is important to train the students to be quantum-aware. In the course of developing quantum technology classes, the balance needs to be taken by considering the education and social-economic backgrounds of the students and the ""return-on-investment""(ROI) from both the student and school resource perspectives. Therefore, to achieve the balance, a QCI specialization was introduced with three classes, namely, Introduction to Quantum Computing, Cryogenic Nanoelectronics, and Quantum Computing Architectures. We will discuss the design of the courses and how they provide the minimal knowledge engineering students need to learn to work in the quantum technology industry.  © 2022 IEEE.","Cryogenic Nanoelectronics; Introduction to Quantum Computing; Quantum Computing Architectures; Quantum Education","Computer architecture; Cryogenics; Curricula; Engineering education; Nanoelectronics; Quantum computers; Semiconductor device manufacture; Cryogenic nanoelectronic; Introduction to quantum computing; Master degree; Quantum Computing; Quantum computing architectures; Quantum education; Quantum Information; Quantum technologies; San Jose State University; Specialisation; Students","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2046220)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT Course EE226, Cryogenic Nanoelectronics was created based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2046220.","Asfaw A., Et al., Building a Quantum Engineering Undergraduate Program, IEEE Transactions on Education, 65, 2, pp. 220-242, (2022); Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2021); Wong H.Y., Introduction to Quantum Computing: From a Layperson to a Programmer in 30 Steps, Switzerland: Springer Nature, (2022); Morrell H.J., Wong H.Y., Study of using Quantum Computer to Solve Poisson Equation in Gate Insulators, 2021 International Conference on Simulation of Semiconductor Processes and Devices (SISPAD), pp. 69-72, (2021); Morrell H., Zaman A., Yung Wong H., Step-by-Step HHL Algorithm Walkthrough to Enhance the Understanding of Critical Quantum Computing Concepts; Zaman A., Yung Wong H., Study of Error Propagation and Generation in Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) Quantum Algorithm, 2022 IEEE Latin America Electron Devices Conference (LAEDC), (2022); Unified Undoped Bulk Silicon Electron and Hole Mobility Model, IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, (2022); Dhillon P., Cong Dao N., Leong W.P.H., Yung Wong H., TCAD Modeling of Cryogenic nMOSFET ON-State Current and Subthreshold Slope, 2021 International Conference on Simulation of Semiconductor Processes and Devices (SISPAD), pp. 255-258, (2021); Jiao T., Yung Wong H., Robust Cryogenic Ab-initio Quantum Transport Simulation for LG=10nm Nanowire, submitted to Solid-State Electronics, (2022); Yung Wong H., Calibrated Si Mobility and Incomplete Ionization Models with Field Dependent Ionization Energy for Cryogenic Simulations, IEEE 2020 International Conference on Simulation of Semiconductor Processes and Devices, pp. 193-196; Dhillon H., Jacob Rosen Y., Beck K., Yung Wong H., Simulation of Single-shot Qubit Readout of a 2-Qubit Superconducting System with Noise Analysis, 2022 IEEE Latin America Electron Devices Conference (LAEDC), (2022)","H.Y.

However, current NV sensing apparatuses use bulky off-the-shelf components, which greatly increase the system's scale. In [3], a compact platform, which attaches nanodiamond particles to a CMOS sensor, shrinks this spin-based magnetometer to chip scale; however, the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) curve it generates carries large fluctuation leading to inferior sensitivity. In this paper, we present a CMOS-NV quantum sensor with (i) a highly-scalable microwave-delivering structure and (ii) a Talboteffect-based photonic filter with enhanced green-to-red suppression ratio. The former enables coherent driving of an increased number of NV centers, and the latter reduces the shot noise of the photo-detector caused by the input green laser. In addition, the usage of a bulk diamond also enables vector magnetometry, which allows for the tracking of magnetic objects and navigation. The prototype sensor provides a measured vector-field sensitivity of 245nT/Hz {1/2}. © 2019 IEEE.","","Magnetic resonance; Magnetism; Magnetometers; Microwave sensors; Nanodiamonds; Shot noise; Nano-diamond particles; Nitrogen vacancies; Off-the-shelf components; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Room-temperature control; Spatial resolution; Suppression ratios; Vector magnetometry; CMOS integrated circuits","","","","","MIT Center for Integrated Circuits & Systems; Singaporean-MIT Research Alliance; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1839159); Army Research Office, ARO; National Science Foundation, NSF","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. 1839159); Funding text 2: This work is supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. 1839159), MIT Center for Integrated Circuits & Systems, Singaporean-MIT Research Alliance, and Master Dynamic Limited.

Quantum sensors attached to data loggers were operated continuously. Hemispherical photographs were taken monthly above the sensors. An additional quantum sensor was used to monitor PPFD outside the canopy. Sensor measurements show large differences between gap and closed-canopy locations and high daily and seasonal variability at each sensor location, with notable increases in solar radiation in gap stations during September and April. The photographs demonstrate that seasonal variation in PPFD results primarily from shifts in the solar angle relative to canopy openings and secondarily from variation in PPFD levels outside the canopy (cloudiness). Photographs also demonstrate an overall decrease in PPFD with time, for the gap stations, owing to vegetation regrowth. Analyses reveal excellent agreement between sensor PPFD measurements and estimates from hemispherical photographs. Long-term monitoring of PPFD enables calibration of hemispherical photography to permit estimation of PPFD with a high degree of reliability. © 1993.","","canopy opening; hemispherical photography; photosynthetic photon flux density; quantum sensor; solar radiation regime; tropical wet forest","","","","","","","Anderson, Studies of the woodland light climate I The photographic computation of light condition, The Journal of Ecology, 52, pp. 27-41, (1964); Becker, Monthly average solar radiation in Panama—daily and hourly relations between direct and global insolation, Sol.

The acceleration can be boosted by pooling compute infrastructures to either parallelize algorithm execution or solve bigger instances that are not feasible on a single quantum computer, which requires an underlying Quantum Internet: the interconnection of quantum computers by quantum links and repeaters to exchange entangled quantum bits. However, Quantum Internet research so far has been focused on provisioning point-to-point flows only, which is suitable for (e.g.) quantum sensing and metrology, but not for distributed quantum computing. In this paper, after a primer on quantum computing and networking, we investigate the requirements and objectives of smart computing on distributed nodes from the perspective of quantum network provisioning. We then design a resource allocation strategy that is evaluated through a comprehensive simulation campaign, whose results highlight the key features and performance issues, and lead the way to further investigation in this direction.  © 2022 IEEE.","Distributed Quantum Computing; Quantum Internet; Quantum Routing","Quantum entanglement; Qubits; 'current; Computing technology; Distributed quantum computing; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Quantum internet; Quantum network; Quantum routing; Resources allocation; Single quantum; Resource allocation","","","","","European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking, (101018180)","2020 FESR/FSC Project ARS01_00734 QUANCOM, and European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (JU) under grant agreement No 101018180 HPCQS.

Recently it was realized that for classical signals, precision and resolution of quantum spectroscopy is limited mainly by coherence of the signal and the stability of the clock used to measure time. The coherence time of the quantum probe, which can be significantly shorter, is not a major limiting factor in resolution measurements. Here, we address a similar question for spectroscopy of quantum signals, for example, a quantum sensor is used to detect a single nuclear spin. We present and analyze a novel correlation spectroscopy technique with performance that is limited by the coherence time of the target spins and the stability of the clock. © 2018 American Physical Society.","","Clocks; Classical clocks; Coherence time; Correlation spectroscopy; Nuclear spins; Quantum sensors; Quantum signals; Resolution measurements; Two-level system; Quantum theory","","","","","European Commission, EC; Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, (1287/15); Israel Science Foundation, ISF, (039-8823)"," We thank Amit Rotem, Daniel Louzon and Nati Aharon for fruitful discussions.

Although quantum computing simulation is parallel by nature, spatial complexity and memory access patterns are major performance hazards. A new methodology employs reduction and decomposition optimizations, exploring properties such as the sparsity of the Id-Operator and the partiality of dense unitary transformations to improve storage and distribution of quantum states. In this work, Shor's and Grover's algorithms are simulated in both CPU and GPU in the Distributed Geometric Machine environment. Additionally, they are compared to LIQUi's results. In all cases, our simulation was faster and allowed for an improved number of qubits when compared to the academic release version of LIQUi|, with relative speedups up to 118×. © 2017 IEEE.","GPU; quantum computing; simulation","Fuzzy systems; Graphics processing unit; Quantum computers; Exponential increase; Machine environment; Memory access patterns; Parallel simulations; Quantum Computing; Quantum transformation; simulation; Unitary transformations; Quantum optics","","","","","Distributed Geometric Machine","Quantum simulations are supported by the Distributed Geometric Machine (D-GM) project.

One approach to achieve these objectives involves developing quantum repeaters as devices that will store and entangle quantum states in a way that allows entanglement to be distributed over larger distances. Professor Nicolas Gisin of the Group of Applied Physics at the University of Geneva and a team of researchers from France, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland have made significant progress in realizing quantum repeaters in the European Commission-funded Quantum repeaters for long-distance fiber-based quantum communication (QuReP) project. The QuReP project aims to produce a quantum repeater similar to the repeaters used in standard communications and their role is to boost an incoming signal and repeat it on the other side.","","Particle beams; Quantum communication; Quantum theory; Applied physics; Quantum encryption; Quantum repeaters; Quantum state; Single-photon detectors; Space satellites; Switzerland; Erbium doped fiber amplifiers","","","","","","","","M.

The wide bandwidth requirement often necessitates high laser power, but this induces significant laser fluctuation noise that affects the detection magnetic field resolution severely. Therefore, enhancement of the magnetic field resolution of wide-bandwidth NV center magnetic sensors is highly important because of the reciprocal effects of the bandwidth and magnetic field resolution. In this article, we develop a common mode rejection (CMR) model to eliminate the laser noise effectively. The simulation results show that the noise level of the light-detected magnetic resonance signal is significantly reduced by a factor of 6.2 after applying the CMR technique. After optimization of the laser power and modulation frequency parameters, the optimal system bandwidth was found to be 75 Hz. Simultaneously, the system’s detection magnetic field resolution was enhanced significantly, increasing from 4.49 nT/Hz1/2 to 790.8 pT/Hz1/2, which represents an improvement of nearly 5.7 times. This wide-bandwidth, high-magnetic field resolution NV color center magnetic sensor will have applications including power systems, geomagnetic navigation, and diamond NV color center current transformers. © 2023 by the authors.","bandwidth; common mode rejection; magnetic field resolution; NV center","Color; Color centers; Electric instrument transformers; Geomagnetism; Magnetic field effects; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic sensors; Nitrogen; Colour centers; Common-mode rejection; Geomagnetic navigation; High magnetic fields; Magnetic-field resolution; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Noise suppression; Power; Wide bandwidth; Diamonds","","","","","Shanxi Outstanding Youth Fund, (202103021221007); Shanxi province key laboratory of quantum sensing and precision measurement, (201905D121001, 202204041101015); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62220106012); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFC2204104)","This research was funded by the International Cooperation and Exchange Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (62220106012), Shanxi Outstanding Youth Fund (202103021221007), Shanxi province key laboratory of quantum sensing and precision measurement (201905D121001), Shanxi international joint laboratory of quantum sensing and precision measurement (202204041101015), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFC2204104).","Xie Y., Yu H., Zhu Y., Qin X., Rong X., Duan C.-K., Du J., A hybrid magnetometer towards femtotesla sensitivity under ambient conditions, Sci.

But as the photons transporting in atmosphere, the environmental interaction causes quantum de-coherence and results in the reduction of super-sensitivity range of the quantum sensors. The most significant effect of atmospheric transmission is photon loss along with phase fluctuation. In this letter, we introduce both the photon loss and phase fluctuation by adding a fictitious beam splitter in the signal arm of Mach- Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The density matrix with N00N and M&M' entangled states being the input states under the condition of photon loss and phase fluctuation is given respectively. Then as the optimal detection schemes parity operator is used as the detector and the formula of the sensitivity is derived. The super-sensitivity range of M&M' and N00N states with de-coherence are simulated. As a consequence, with high photon loss M&M' states shows the better phase sensitivity than N00N states but the N00N state is better when the loss is smaller than 20%. And with pure phase fluctuations N00N states get the longer range. M&M' states is sensitive to the transmittance difference between two arms of the interferometer. © 2015 SPIE.","atmosphere transmission; Mach-Zehnder interferometer; quantum de-coherence; quantum sensing","Interferometers; Light; Mach-Zehnder interferometers; Optical radar; Optical testing; Photons; Quantum entanglement; Atmospheric transmissions; Environmental interactions; Machzehnder interferometers (MZI); Optimal detection; Phase fluctuation; Phase sensitivity; quantum sensing; Standard quantum limits; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Zerom P., Chan K.W.C., Howell J.C., Et al., Entangled-photon compressive ghost imaging, Physical Review A, 84, 6, pp. 14717-14719, (2011); Peng C.Z., Yang T., Bao X.H., Et al., Experimental free-space distribution of entangled photon pairs over 13 km: Towards satellite-based global quantum communication, Physical Review Letters, 94, 5, (2005); Rozema L.A., Bateman J.D., Mahler D.H., Et al., Scalable spatial superresolution using entangled photons, Physical Review Letters, 112, 22, pp. 770-777, (2014); Dorner U., Demkowicz-Dobrzanski R., Smith B.J., Et al., Optimal Quantum Phase Estimation, (2008); Kok P., Lee H., Dowling J.P., Creation of large-photon-number path entanglement conditioned on photodetection, Physical Review A, 65, 5, pp. 882-886, (2001); O'Brien J.L., Pryde G.J., Gilchrist A., Et al., Quantum process tomography of a controlled- NOT gate, Phys.rev.lett, 93, 8, pp. 8193-8195, (2004); Mitchell M.W., Lundeen J.S., Steinberg A.M., Super-resolving phase measurements with a multiphoton entangled state, Nature, 429, 6988, pp. 161-164, (2004); Huver S., Wildfeuer C., Dowling J., Entangled Fock states for robust quantum optical metrology, imaging, and sensing, Physical Review A, 78, 6, pp. 063828-063834, (2008); Bardhan B.R., Jiang K., Dowling J.P., Effects of phase fluctuations on phase sensitivity and visibility of path-entangled photon fock states, Phys.rev.a, 88, 2, pp. 195-201, (2013); Bardhan B.R., Dowling J.P., Effects of phase fluctuations on the sensitivity of NOON state in a noisy environment, Conference on Coherence and Quantum Optics, M6, 19, (2013); Chiruvelli A., Lee H., Parity Measurements in Quantum Optical Metrology, (2009); Gerry C., Mimih J., The parity operator in quantum optical metrology, Contemporary Physics, 51, 6, pp. 497-511, (2010); Andrews L.C., Phillips R.L., Laser beam propagation through random media, Storage and Retrieval for Image and Video Databases, (2005); Bollinger J.J., Itano W.M., Winel D.J., Et al., Optimal frequency measurements with maximally correlated states, Physical Review A, 54, 6, pp. R4649-R4652, (1996); Gerry C.C., Heisenberg-limit interferometry with four-wave mixers operating in a nonlinear regime, Phys, "" Rev A, (2000); Jiang K., Brignac C.J., Weng Y., Et al., Strategies for choosing path-entangled number states for optimal robust quantum optical metrology in the presence of loss, Phys.rev.a, 86, 1, pp. 1934-1935, (2012); Bohmann M., Sperling J., Vogel W., Entanglement and Phase Properties of Noisy N00N States, (2014); Ruizhong R., Light Propagation in the Turbulent Atmosphere, (2005)","","Ellis J.D.; Guo Y.; Han S.; Guo J.","SPIE","Chinese Society for Optical Engineering","Applied Optics and Photonics, China: Optical Test, Measurement, and Equipment, AOPC 2015","5 May 2015 through 7 May 2015","Beijing","117015","0277786X","978-162841902-3","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84950335579"

The arrays consist of hundreds of platelet feed horns assembled from gold-coated stacks of micro-machined silicon wafers. As a first step, Au-coated Si waveguides with a circular, corrugated cross section were fabricated; their attenuation was measured to be less than 0.15 dB/cm from 80 to 110 GHz at room temperature. To ease the manufacture of horn arrays, electrolytic deposition of Au on degenerate Si without a metal seed layer was demonstrated. An apparatus for measuring the radiation pattern, optical efficiency, and spectral band-pass of prototype horns is described. Feed horn arrays made of silicon may find use in measurements of the polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation.","MEMs; Millimeter wave optics; Observational cosmology","","","","","","","","Yoon K.W., Appel J.W., Austermann J.E., Beall J.A., Becker D., Benson B.A., Bleem L.E., Britton J., Carlstrom J.E., Chang C.L., Cho H.M., Crites A.T., Everett W., Essinger-Hileman T., Halverson N.W., Henning J.W., Hilton G.C., Irwin K.D., McMahon J., Mehl J., Meyer S.S., Niemack M.D., Parker L.P., Simon S.M., Staggs S.T., Visnjic C., Yoon K.Y., Zhao Y., LTD-13 Proceedings, (2009); Clarricoats P.J.B., Olver A.D., Corrugated Horns for Microwave Antennas, (1984); Antenna Handbook - Theory, Applications and Design, (1988); Bock J., Gundersen J., Lee A., Richards P., Wollack E., Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 155, (2009); McAuley S.A., Ashraf H., Atabo L., Chambers A., Hall S., Hopkins J., Nicholls G., Journal of Physics D-Applied Physics, 34, (2001); Kaye G.W.C., Laby T.H., Tabes of Physical and Chemical Constants, (2009); Fuller A.J.B., Microwaves, (1979); Munoz R.C., Vidal G., Mulsow M., Lisoni J.G., Arenas C., Concha A., Mora F., Espejo R., Kremer G., Moraga L., Esparza R., Haberle P., Physical Review B, 62, (2000); Tischer F.J., IEEE T.

Motivated by distributed quantum computing and communication, quantum repeaters that relay discrete-variable quantum information have been extensively studied; while continuous-variable (CV) quantum information underpins a variety of quantum sensing and communication application, a quantum-repeater architecture for genuine CV quantum information remains largely unexplored. This paper reports a CV quantum-repeater architecture based on CV quantum teleportation assisted by the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code to significantly suppress the physical noise. The designed CV quantum-repeater architecture is shown to significantly improve the performance of entanglement-assisted communication, target detection based on quantum illumination and CV quantum key distribution, as three representative use cases for quantum communication and sensing.  © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","entanglement distribution; Gottesman-Kitaev-Perskill state; quantum error corrections; quantum information; quantum photonics; quantum repeaters; teleportation","Architecture; Error correction; Network architecture; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Continuous variables; Entanglement distribution; Errors correction; Gottesman-kitaev-perskill state; Quantum error corrections; Quantum Information; Quantum network; Quantum photonics; Quantum repeaters; Teleportation; Quantum optics","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CCF-1907918, ECCS-1920742, EEC-1941583); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (N660012014029)","This research is supported by National Science Foundation Grant Nos.

However, the frequency range of AC sensing protocols based on dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences has not been thoroughly explored experimentally. In this work, we aimed to determine the sensitivity of the ac magnetic field as a function of frequency using the sequential readout method. The upper limit at high frequency is clearly determined by Rabi frequency, in line with the expected effect of finite DD-pulse width. In contrast, the lower frequency limit is primarily governed by the duration of optical repolarization rather than the decoherence time (T (Formula presented.)) of NV spins. This becomes particularly crucial when the repetition (dwell) time of the sequential readout is fixed to maintain the acquisition bandwidth. The equation we provide successfully describes the tendency in the frequency dependence. In addition, at the near-optimal frequency of 1 MHz, we reached a maximum sensitivity of 229 pT/ (Formula presented.)  by employing the XY4-(4) DD sequence. © 2023 by the authors.","AC frequency limit; AC sensing; diamond; nitrogen-vacancy color center; sequential readout","Color centers; Electric impedance measurement; Magnetic fields; Nitrogen; Alternating current; Alternating-current frequency limit; Alternating-current sensing; Colour centers; Current frequency; Current sensing; Frequency limits; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy color center; Sequential readout; Diamonds","","","","","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2019-000296); Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, KRISS; Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP","This research was supported by a grant (GP2022-0010) from Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, and the Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2019-000296).","Glenn D.R., Bucher D.B., Lee J., Lukin M.D., Park H., Walsworth R.L., High-resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopy using a solid-state spin sensor, Nature, 555, pp. 351-354, (2018); Deans C., Cohen Y., Yao H., Maddox B., Vigilante A., Renzoni F., Electromagnetic induction imaging with a scanning radio frequency atomic magnetometer, Appl.

The cnot operation is performed by applying a protocol of five laser pulses of appropriate frequency and polarization. The laser-pulse protocol exploits auxiliary levels, and its imperfect implementation leads to unitary as well as non-unitary errors affecting the cnot operation. We provide a characterization of such imperfections, which are physically realistic and have never been considered before to the best of our knowledge. Our characterization shows that imperfect laser pulses unavoidably cause a leak of information from the states which alone should be transformed by the ideal gate, into the ancillary states exploited by the experimental implementation. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2010.","Cirac-Zoller CNOT gate; Decoerence; Error models; Ion-trap quantum computing","Characterization; Laser pulses; Logic gates; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Telecommunication networks; Ancillary state; Auxiliary levels; CNOT gate; Decoerence; Error model; Ion traps; Quantum Computing; Quantum communication","","","","","","","Cirac J.I., Zoller P., New frontiers in quantum information with atoms and ions, Phys.

However, when trying to detect weak signals that are hidden by background noise, the signal-to-noise ratio is a more relevant metric than raw sensitivity. We identify, under modest assumptions about the statistical properties of the signal and noise, the optimal quantum control to detect an external signal in the presence of background noise using a quantum sensor. Interestingly, for white background noise, the optimal solution is the simple and well-known spin-locking control scheme. Using numerical techniques, we further generalize these results to the case of background noise with a Lorentzian spectrum. We show that for increasing correlation time, pulse based sequences, such as CPMG, are also close to the optimal control for detecting the signal, with the crossover dependent on the signal frequency. These results show that an optimal detection scheme can be easily implemented in near-term quantum sensors without the need for complicated pulse shaping. © 2021, The Author(s).","","Pulse shaping; Quantum theory; Signal detection; Signal to noise ratio; Estimating parameters; External perturbations; Lorentzian spectrum; Numerical techniques; Optimal detection; Optimal quantum control; Signal frequencies; Statistical properties; Correlation detectors","","","","","ARO-MURI; Applied Physics Laboratory; National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Army Research Office, ARO; Office of Science, SC; Advanced Scientific Computing Research, ASCR, (ERKJ347)","The authors would like to thank Mohammad Hafezi, Jeff Barnes, Colin Trout, and Timothy Sweeney for useful discussions.

Based on this, this paper aims to give an overview and glimpse of the potential horizon of this area of study that has become increasingly robust in computing over the recent past. It is beyond our scope to address deep concepts of quantum mechanics on which quantum computing is based and reveals. It is rather to form a simple, comprehensive and consistent intellectual scope, not only for specialists but targeted common interest.

However, generation of these photons usually requires atomic ensembles with high optical depth or spontaneous parametric down-conversion with sophisticated optical cavity. By manipulating the two-component biphoton wave function generated from a low-optical-depth (low-OD) atomic ensemble, we demonstrate biphotons with subnatural linewidth in the sub-MHz regime. The potential to shape and manipulate the quantum wave packets of these temporally long photons is also demonstrated and discussed. Our work has potential applications in realizing quantum repeaters and large cluster states for LDQC and LOQC, respectively. The possibility to generate and manipulate subnatural-linewidth biphotons with low OD also opens up the opportunity to miniaturize the biphoton sou  © 2020 American Physical Society.","","Linewidth; Optical properties; Photons; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Wave functions; Linear optical quantum computing; Narrow bandwidth; Optical cavities; Quantum interference; Quantum repeaters; Quantum wave packets; Spontaneous parametric down conversion; Subnatural linewidth; Optical communication","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (107-2112-M-007-004-MY3, 107-2745-M-007-001)","The authors thank P.

In this paper, based on quantum and classical computation principles, a new quantum encryption algorithm using the symmetric key is presented. It is a block-cipher algorithm which means that each message contains blocks in which 4 bits for each. Firstly, keyed rotations and permutation of the message bits are used. Secondly, the encrypted message is converted to qubits then several dynamic quantum gates are applied to them key dependently to make the ciphertext state reach the state of non-orthogonality. In consequence of the principles of quantum mechanics, the eaves cannot distinguish the non-orthogonal states of the encrypted message. The proposed algorithm is proofed to increase the message space, the various algorithm analysis proofed that our proposed algorithm has an improved strength against various attacks, including the brute force attack.  © 2021 IEEE.","Pauli Gates; Quantum Bits (Qubits); Quantum Cryptography; Trojan Horse Attack","Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Algorithm analysis; Block cipher algorithms; Brute-force attack; Encrypted messages; Encryption algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum encryption algorithm; Quantum properties; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Bennett C., Brassard G., Quantum cryptography: Public-key distribution and coin tossing, Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computers, Systems and Signal Processing, Bangalore, India, pp. 175-179, (1984); Shor P.W., Preskill J., Simple proof of security of the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol, Phys.

But an emerging class of quantum sensors that use Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) to detect rf electric fields have yet to reach the SQL. In this work we prove that this discrepancy is due to fundamental limitations in the EIT probing mechanism. We derive the optimum sensitivity of a three-level quantum sensor based on EIT, or more generally coherent spectroscopy, and compare this to the SQL. We apply a minimal set of assumptions, while allowing strong probing fields, thermal broadening, and large optical depth. We derive the optimal laser intensities and optical depth, providing specific guidelines for sensitive operation under common experimental conditions. Clear boundaries of performance are established, revealing that ladder-EIT cannot achieve the SQL due to unavoidable absorption loss. The results may be applied to any EIT-based quantum sensor, but we particularly emphasize our results' importance to the growing field of Rydberg quantum sensing. © 2021 Published by the American Physical Society","","Electric fields; Quantum optics; Transparency; Coherent spectroscopies; Electromagnetically-induced transparency; Fundamental limitations; Optical depth; Optimum Sensitivity; Quantum sensors; Rf electric fields; Rydberg; Standard quantum limits; Three-level; Quantum entanglement","","","","","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Office of Naval Research Naval Air Warfare Center; Weapons Division; Office of Naval Research, ONR; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division, NAWCWD","Funding text 1: The authors thank Clement Wong for helpful discussions and recognize financial support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Quantum Apertures program.

In the proposed quantum copy-protection system, classical data are stored in the secret rotation angles of non-orthogonal quantum states. The decryption of the stored information is not possible in the classical representation and the decryption mechanism of data qubits is realised by secret unitary rotations. The data protection system uses a quantum-based data storage system and quantum media authentication method to distinguish between original and forged data media. This paper discusses the working mechanism of quantum copy protection and analyses the success probabilities of the quantum probabilistic authentication steps.

Observation of free induction decays is an essential ingredient for high resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance, and the present work extends it to the atomic scale. We also discuss the origin of the proton as incorporation during chemical vapor deposition growth, which provides an opportunity to use protons in diamond as built-in quantum memories coupled with the NV center.  © 2020 Author(s).","","Chemical vapor deposition; Diamonds; Coherent control; Detection and controls; Electronic spins; Free induction decay; Hyperfine parameters; Multi-pulse sequence; Nitrogen vacancies; Proton nuclear magnetic resonance; Chemical detection","","","","","Spintronics Research Network of Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (18H01502, 19H02547, 26220602, JP17J05890); Development of Advanced Measurement and Analysis Systems, SENTAN","K.S. was supported by the JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Research Fellowship for Young Scientists (DC1), Grant No. JP17J05890.

The former is the minimum size of the initially shared state σ on which local operations by the two parties (without communication) can generate the target state ρ, and the latter is the minimum amount of communication needed when initially sharing nothing. In this paper, we generalize these two concepts to multipartite cases, for both exact and approximate state generation. Our results are summarized as follows.1.For multipartite pure states, the correlation complexity can be completely characterized by local ranks of sybsystems.2.We extend the notion of PSD-rank of matrices to that of tensors, and use it to bound the quantum correlation complexity for generating multipartite classical distributions.3.For generating multipartite mixed quantum states, communication complexity is not always equal to correlation complexity (as opposed to bipartite case). But they differ by at most a factor of 2. Generating a multipartite mixed quantum state has the same communication complexity as generating its optimal purification. But the correlation complexities of these two tasks can be different (though still related by less than a factor of 2).4.To generate a bipartite classical distribution P(x, y) approximately, the quantum communication complexity is completely characterized by the approximate PSD-rank of P. The quantum correlation complexity of approximately generating multipartite pure states is bounded by approximate local ranks. © 2016, Springer International Publishing.","multipartite system; PSD-rank; Quantum communication complexity; quantum correlation complexity","","","","","","","","Moody C., Robert P., Nonnegative matrix factorization and applications, Bulletin of the International Linear Algebra Society, 34, pp. 2-7, (2005); Kremer I., Quantum Communication.

Collisions in the channel and unused timeslots result in poor performance. On the other hand, quantum superdense coding proved that entanglement-assisted quantum communications can improve the data transmission rates compared with classical systems. It allows sending two classical bits from one party to another in exchange of one quantum bit and a pre-shared entangled Bell pair. This paper introduces a new protocol, which involves a modified version of superdense coding to medium access control of distributed communication systems. Using a pre-shared entangled Bell pair and one classical bit, 2.5 classical bits can be transmitted in average between the parties in each timeslot.

Since quantum computers have exponential calculation acceleration compared with traditional computers, the main problems in implementing quantum computing simulation on traditional computers are low computational efficiency and long time-consuming. A quantum circuit which is a sequence of quantum gates acting on a collection of qubits is the general quantum computing model. So by the means of quantum circuit optimization, the calculation speed can be significantly increased while keeping the calculation result unchanged. The existing empirical rules of quantum circuit optimization methods have limitations and there is no common and automatic quantum circuit optimization method. In this paper, a general and automatic quantum circuit optimization method based on the genetic algorithm is proposed, by which the equivalent optimal quantum circuit is obtained through a finite number of searching in a large searching space. This method is not limited by the hardware of the quantum computing simulation and the composition of the quantum circuit. The experimental results show that for the QFT algorithm of 29 qubits, the running time can be shortened by 41.4% and for the variational circuit of 6 qubits, the running time can be shortened by 18.8% compared with the state-of-the-art quantum circuit optimization method. So this method can improve the quantum computing simulation capability and operating efficiency and provide a rapid development way for quantum algorithms and applications.  © 2021 IEEE.","automatic optimization; genetic algorithm; quantum circuits; Quantum simulation","Computational efficiency; Computer hardware; Computer software; Efficiency; Quantum chemistry; Quantum efficiency; Quantum optics; Qubits; Simulation platform; Timing circuits; Automatic optimization; Circuit optimization; Optimization method; Quanta computers; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum simulations; Running time; Simulation platform; Traditional computers; Genetic algorithms","","","","","Qian Xuesen Youth Innovation Foundation; China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, CASC, (2019JY39)","Funding: The Qian Xuesen Youth Innovation Foundation from China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (grant number 2019JY39).
