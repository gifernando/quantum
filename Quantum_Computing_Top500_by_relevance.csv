As the scale of the quantum processors increases, the inaccuracy in the RF circuit becomes an increasingly significant source of non-idealities that impacts the qubit operations. In this paper, we propose a closed-form model to characterize the effects of inaccuracies in the controlling RF circuits on the fidelity of single-qubit control operation of superconducting qubits. Different from previous works, our model allows characterization of multiple inaccuracies at the same time, significantly enhancing the guidance capabilities for practical quantum computing hardware design and optimization. In addition, the accuracy of the proposed model is also verified by a quantum-classical co-simulator.

A quantum processor executes algorithms by applying a programmable sequence of gates to an initialized state of qubits, which coherently evolves into a final state containing the result of the computation. Although quantum processors with a few qubits have been demonstrated on multiple quantum computing platforms, realization of solid-state programmable quantum processor under ambient conditions remains elusive. Here we report a programable quantum processor that can be programmed with fifteen parameters to realize arbitrary unitary transformations on two spin qubits in a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. We implemented the Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover search algorithms with average success rates above 80%. The results pave the way to implement the programmable method in a large-scale quantum processor. © 2019, The Author(s).","","Quantum optics; Qubits; Ambient conditions; Classical counterpart; Grover search algorithm; Nitrogen vacancies; Physical state; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; Unitary transformations; Quantum entanglement","Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (QYZDB-SSW-SLH005, QYZDY-SSW-SLH004); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST, (Grants 2018YFA0306600); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFB0501603, 2018YFA0306600)","We are grateful to D.

Domains such as high-energy-physics and remote-sensing hyperspectral imagery require high compute capabilities and can benefit from applying QWT for dimension reduction of multidimensional data. However, quantum circuits for QWT include permutations that contribute to large overall circuit depth. Deep circuits pose a critical challenge for state-of-the-art quantum computers because of quantum decoherence. In this work, we propose QWT circuits, which are optimized in terms of circuit depth, to account for the effects of decoherence, and resulting in high fidelity and efficient implementation on quantum processors. We present the circuits in generalized forms and show that they can be used for multilevel decomposable, multidimensional wavelet operations. Experimental evaluation of the proposed circuits is performed through simulation using MATLAB and IBM-Q qasm, and implemented on a real 15-qubit quantum processor from IBM. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","Quantum Computing; Quantum Wavelet Transform","Computation theory; Computer circuits; High energy physics; MATLAB; Program processors; Quantum computers; Remote sensing; Signal reconstruction; Spectroscopy; Timing circuits; Decoherence; Multi dimensional; Multilevels; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum computing, quantum wavelet transform; Quantum processors; Qubit; Wavelets transform; Discrete wavelet transforms","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","10897801","","IICOF","","English","IEEE Internet Comput","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121351298"

Since the launch of the IBM Quantum Experience project in 2016, the research activities in this area are strongly increased. This project provides the public access to quantum processors composed of superconducting physical computing elements known as qubits. Unfortunately, qubits are sensitive to noise and, for this reason, quantum computation can be affected by errors. As a consequence, there is a strong emergence for so- called quantum error mitigation methods aimed to attenuate the quantum error as much as possible, without requiring a strong additional computational effort. Among the most error- prone operations, there is surely the quantum measurement. Conventionally, mitigation methods for quantum measurement error compute a so-called mitigation matrix capable of correcting results outputted by a quantum processor. In this paper, a new measurement error mitigation approach based on genetic algorithms whose fitness function uses Bhattacharyya distance is proposed to learn an appropriate mitigation matrix. As shown in the experimental session, the proposed measurement error mitigation method outperforms the traditional approach.  © 2021 IEEE.","","Matrix algebra; Measurement errors; Quantum optics; Qubits; Bhattacharyya distance; Computing performance; Error mitigation; matrix; Mitigation methods; Quantum Computing; Quantum error; Quantum measurement; Quantum processors; Research areas; Genetic algorithms","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1062922X","978-166544207-7","PICYE","","English","Conf.

The multiscale process takes a bottom-up approach, which integrates device-level simulations into quantum circuit simulations for semiconductor QD array processors. This process allows essential device physics to be incorporated in the assessment of quantum circuit performance for a Si- or Ge-QD- based quantum processor. The results show that the Ge hole array provides a promising semiconductor platform to enhance entanglement between neighboring QDs for two-qubit quantum gates. Furthermore, a two-qubit quantum gate based on holes in Ge can achieve fast gate speed, and smaller device variability compared to its Si counterpart. Design and multiscale simulation of the Ge QD array processor shows its potential to achieve high fidelity in preparing the ansatz state of quantum chemistry simulations based on variational quantum eigensolver.

Here, we propose a low-latency and time-deterministic FPGA-based network supporting execution of distributed quantum circuits. We focus on transmissions of measurement result and control messages as well as synchronization in a distributed network. We demonstrate that a message is transmitted with 361.60 ns between QPUs using optical Ethernet. Synchronization reaches 9.6 ns precision using only Ethernet frames and can reach 21 ps with an external clock. Further, a use-case example of an Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform is implemented to evaluate the impact in terms of latency for inter-QPU data transfers. Our theoretical error analysis and simulation results show that the latency added by our FPGA-controlled network has a negligible impact on the quantum algorithm performance for practical values of memory decoherence time.  © 2023 IEEE.","Distributed quantum computing; FPGA; FPGA control; Low latency network; Quantum algorithm","Data transfer; Distributed computer systems; Ethernet; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Deterministics; Distributed quantum computing; FPGA control; Large scale quantum computers; Latency control; Low latency; Low-latency networks; Performance; Processing units; Quantum algorithms; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","Quantum Data Centre of Future UKRI, (10004793); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/T001011/1)","We acknowledge the funding support from the Quantum Communication Hub by the EPSRC grant ref.

It is not straight forward to transfer the current programming skill on a classical computer to a quantum computer. This work presents an example of programming a quantum computer. The compact genetic algorithm is used as a target as it is powerful and popular method in evolutionary computation. A quantum bit (qubit) concept was introduced as a basis for storing information. The representation of quantum register has benefits over classical computing, i.e. the quantum operation allows manipulating qubits in the way that it is impossible in a classical computer.

Here we demonstrate excellent qubit device uniformity and tunability from 300K down to mK temperatures. This is achieved, for the first time, by integrating an overlapping polycrystalline silicon-based gate stack in an 'all-Silicon' and lithographically flexible 300mm flow. Low-disorder Si/SiO2 is proved by a 10K Hall mobility of 1.5·104 cm2/Vs. Well-controlled sensors with low charge noise (3.6 μeV/√Hz at 1 Hz) are used for charge sensing down to the last electron. We demonstrate excellent and reproducible interdot coupling control over nearly 2 decades (2-100 GHz). We show spin manipulation and single-shot spin readout, extracting a valley splitting energy of around 150 μeV. These low-disorder, uniform qubit devices and 300mm fab integration pave the way for fast scale-up to large quantum processors. © 2021 JSAP.","300 mm quantum computing; polycristalline silicon; Si-MOS quantum dots; spin qubits","Electrospinning; Hall mobility; Magnetic moments; Polycrystalline materials; Silicon; VLSI circuits; Charge sensing; Electron spin qubits; Interdot coupling; Quantum processors; Qubit devices; Spin manipulation; Tunable coupling; Valley splitting; Qubits","FWO-Vlaanderen, (1S60020N)","selected devices (Fig.3). The narrow Vth distribution and smooth subthreshold turn-on indicate a high quality of the nanostructure. This is further confirmed by successful formation of an electron sensing island between the left (LB) and right (RB) barrier gates, (Fig.4,5a). Noise characterization returns an expected 1/f noise power density spectrum with a low amplitude of 3.6 µeV/√Hz at 1 Hz (Fig.5b,c). SET sensing measurements verify device operation in single electron occupation for both the single-and double quantum dot mode (Fig.6,7). In the low electron-count regime, dynamic control of the tunnel coupling tc is crucial for high fidelity two-qubit gates. Coupling strength tc is extracted from the charge transition width, using a lever arm of 0.3 eV/V derived from the thermal broadening (Fig.8a,b) [7]. We show reproducible and symmetric tc control of up to 100 GHz, over nearly 2 decades, using the barrier gate voltage VB1 for two different charge transitions: (0,1)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(2,0) (Fig.8c,d). The excellent tunability and high tc achieved in the single electron regime further justify the exceptional interface quality, as required for high-fidelity qubits. For qubit operation, a static magnetic field B0 is applied, splitting the electron spin states by the Zeeman energy EZ. The spin of the last electron in the dot can be read out using a spin-to-charge conversion technique [8]. Spin lifetime T1 is extracted and shows an expected B0 dependency [9]. A relaxation hotspot, occurring when EZ matches the valley splitting EV, is measured for fields between 1.1 T and 1.3 T, corresponding to EV in the range of 127 to 150 µeV. Spin states are manipulated using Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) techniques with an on-chip antenna (Fig.9b). The extracted FWHM of ~2 MHz is consistent with that of donor bound electron spins in natural Si [10]. Conclusion & Outlook We use a novel ‘all-Silicon’ integration approach to demonstrate excellent Si-MOS spin qubit devices on natural-Si substates. Well-controlled process uniformity and high Si/SiO2 interface quality lead to reproducible electrical response across the entire temperature range (300K-mK). We demonstrate excellent tunnel coupling control in last electron regimes. This unprecedented reproducibility opens the path towards large-scale, spin-based quantum processors.

Such ideas are not only helping the advance towards practical quantum computation applications, but are also providing clearer understanding of quantum computation itself. Eventually, several new exploratory efforts to increase the efficiency beyond the inherent advantage of quantum computational systems to classical systems will materialize. As a part of these exploration efforts, this paper presents a modified version of the qubit, which we refer to as a ""Qubit"", that allows a smaller number of Qubits than qubits to reach the same result in applications such as Shor's algorithm for the factorization of large numbers. The current model of the qubit consists of a quantum bit with two states, a zero and a one in a quantum superposition state. The Qubit, which consists of more than two states, is introduced and explained. A mathematical analysis of the Qubit within Hubert space is given. We present examples of applications of the Qubit to several quantum computing algorithms, including discussion of the advantages and disadvantages that are involved. Finally a physical model to construct such a Qubit is considered.","Quantum; Quantum Computation; Qubit; Shor's Algorithm; Superposition","Computational methods; Computer simulation; Cryptography; Fourier transforms; Harmonic generation; Mathematical models; Oscillators (electronic); Quantum computation; Quantum computing; Qubit; Shor's algorithm; Superposition; Quantum theory","","","R.

The distinguishing feature of multi-qubit quantum control-gates is that they act on target qubits according to the state of control qubit(s). In this sense, there exist 2- and 3-qubit quantum gates such as Controlled-NOT, Toffoli (Controlled-Controlled-NOT), Controlled-Hadamard, Controlled-Swap and so on. In order to make complex quantum circuits easier and control more qubits, it is necessary to work out mathematical models of new control gates acting on more than three qubits depending on the state of control qubit. Therefore, in this work, mathematical model of multi-qubit universal control gate is worked out and some control gates are formulated in accordance with the proposed model, moreover the tests of these novel control gates are carried out using online open resource or virtual laboratory that is called ""Quirk"". Existing 2- and 3-qubit control gates can also be derived using this model. Matrix representations of Controlled-NOT-NOT, Controlled-Hadamard-Hadamard, Controlled-NOT-NOT-Hadamard, Controlled-Hadamard-Swap and Controlled-Hadamard-SWAP-NOT gates are derived using the proposed mathematical model. These quantum gates are unitary and reversible gates. Using the proposed model and novel quantum gates will help to reduce complexity of quantum circuits and develop new cryptographic algorithms.  © 2022 ACM.","mathematical modelling; multi-qubit control gate; quantum computing; quantum gates","Logic gates; Control gates; Controlled NOT; Hadamard; Mathematical modeling; Multi-qubit control gate; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum gates; State of control; Universal control; Qubits","","","B.A. Jumayev; State Energy Institute of Turkmenistan, Türkmenistanyň Döwlet Energetika Instituty, Mary, Bayramhan street No. 62, 745400, Turkmenistan; email: bayramtdei87@mail.ru","Vassilev T.; University of Ruse, Department of Informatics and IT, 8 Studentska St, Ruse; Trifonov R.; Technical University of Sofia, Department of IT in Industry, 8 St Kliment Ohridski blvd, Sofia","Association for Computing Machinery","","978-145039644-8","","","English","ACM Int.

Shor's algorithm has sparked a worldwide race to build a machine powerful enough to crack codes. The first step in building a quantum computer is to find a quantum bit or qubit. Since the discovery of trapped beryllium ions as qubit to perform logic operations, physicists have come up with at least half a dozen potential ways to do quantum computation. Qubit, being the heart of any quantum computer, has the ability to have two values simultaneously called the principle of superposition. It allows a register of qubits to hold exponentially more information than the register with the same number of classical bits. A set of requirements is needed if it were used as a quantum computer. These include setting the qubits to 0 at the start of the calculation, reading the answer after the calculation, qubits must last long enough to run a program, computer must carry out two fundamental operations and the system's basic architecture must be able to handle large number of qubits. The small scale quantum algorithms that scientists are running today and plan to run in the future will lead to insights that could make full-scale quantum computing.","","Beryllium; Cryptography; Decoding; Logic programming; Metal ions; Beryllium ions; Principle of superposition; Quantum bit; Quantum computers","","","","","","00189235","","IEESA","","English","IEEE Spectrum","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34548044268"

Such a QDN differs from existing quantum key distribution (QKD) networks in that the former must deliver data quantum bits (i.e., qubits) reliably between different quantum computers. Two families of QDNs are studied, one using teleportation, named Tele-QDN, and the other using tell-and-go (TAG), named TAG-QDN. In order to provide reliable delivery of data qubits, while addressing QDN-specific constraints imposed by quantum physics laws such as the no-cloning theorem, and limited availability of quantum memory, two corresponding transport layer protocols suitable for distributed implementation are designed and evaluated. Such distributed quantum transport protocols (DTPs), named Tele-DTP and TAG-DTP, are the first-of-its-kind and are complementary to existing works on the protocol stack for QDNs which are at the network layer and below. Both analysis and extensive simulations show that the proposed DTPs can achieve high throughput and fairness. This study also offers new insights into potential tradeoffs involved in using different types of QDNs.

Among proposed realizations of quantum bits nano-electronic circuits appear most promising for integration in electronic circuits and large-scale applications. We discuss Josephson junction circuits in two regimes where they can be used for quantum computing. In one limit, two logic states of the quantum bit differ by a Cooper pair charge, 2e, on a superconducting island. In the other limit different magnetic fluxes penetrate a superconducting loop in two states. Single-qubit and two-qubit logic operations can be performed by means of voltage or current pulses. Weak coupling to the environment allows a series of these elementary steps before the phase coherence is lost. To read out the result of the computation a quantum measurement is needed. For charge qubits this can be accomplished by coupling a single-electron transistor (SET) capacitively to the qubit. Monitoring the current in the transistor one can extract the information about the state of the qubit.

A current integrator and correlation double sampling circuit are implemented in the proposed current comparator since precise current sensing is required to achieve readout the states of qubits. The measurement results indicate the feasibility that the reduced readout time by a factor of 1/100 and 100-times better current resolution with the readout fidelity of 99.9 % compared to the conventional readout systems are achieved.

Runtime assertion is challenging in quantum computing for two key reasons. First, a quantum bit (qubit) cannot be copied, which is known as the non-cloning theorem. Second, when a qubit is measured, its superposition state collapses into a classical state, losing the inherent parallel information. In this paper, we overcome these challenges with runtime computation through ancilla qubits, which are used to indirectly collect the information of the qubits of interest.

Even though classical computers have become smaller and faster, they are still incapable of solving issues like factoring huge integers, messages are sent in coded form using large digit prime integers. Currently, hundreds of electrons are used to turn on or off a single transistor on a chip in classical computing. To achieve great performance, we must progress past the limitations of conventional computing using electrons as well as silicon and into the non-silicon era. One solution that is gaining some traction is quantum computing. Quantum computers typically built on quantum bits (qubits) and take advantage of quantum features like quantum superposition and quantum entanglement to overcome the miniaturization issues of classical computing. Quantum superposition simply states that a quantum unit can exist in 2 different places at once. According to this hypothesis, simultaneously qubits can represent a wide range of 1 and 0 combinations. Quantum computers are acquiring processing power at a twice exponential rate, according to this observation. To gain an exponential growth in power scaling, the qubits are replaced with bits. The best part is that there are numerous choices available, from quantum computing to miraculous materials such as nanotechnology, and customized processors. Regardless of which path we choose, the future of computers promises to be exciting. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Bijection; Classical computing; Exponential growth; Moore’s law; Non-silicon computers; Quantum computing; Quantum entanglement; Quantum scaling; Quantum superposition; Quantum tunneling; Qubits","","","","N.

While critical aspects of quantum computing are being demonstrated in laboratories across the world, a fully functional and practical quantum computer is still many years away. It therefore becomes of great interest to discover applications of small-scale quantum computers which are the subject of current theoretical and experimental research.

This process is called quantum state preparation, and its complexity for non-structured data is exponential on the number of qubits. Several works address this problem, for instance, by using variational methods that train a fixed depth circuit with manageable complexity. These methods have their limitations, as the lack of a back-propagation technique and barren plateaus. This work proposes an algorithm to reduce state preparation circuit depth by offloading computational complexity to a classical computer. The initialized quantum state can be exact or an approximation, and we show that the approximation is better on today&#x2019;s quantum processors than the initialization of the original state. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method enables more efficient initialization of probability distributions in a quantum state.

With long-lived qubits it is, however, inefficient to wait until the qubits have relaxed to their ground state after completion of an experiment. Moreover, for error-correction schemes it is important to rapidly reinitialize syndrome qubits. We present a simple pulsed qubit reset protocol based on a two-pulse sequence. A first pulse transfers the excited-state population to a higher excited qubit state and a second pulse transfer it into a lossy environment provided by a low-Q transmission-line resonator, which is also used for qubit read-out. We show that the remaining excited-state population can be suppressed to (1.7±0.1)% and that this figure may be reduced by further improving the pulse calibration. © 2018 American Physical Society.","","Error correction; Ground state; Quantum optics; Qubits; Error-correction schemes; Fixed frequency; Pulse calibration; Pulse transfer; Quantum Computing; State population; Superconducting qubits; Transmission line resonators; Excited states","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (765267)","","","","American Physical Society","23317019","","","","English","Phys.

Therefore, if a quantum computer could obtain algorithms by itself, the applicable field of QC would be extended greatly. In this study, we investigate a learning method for a quantum bit network (QBN) by utilizing the analogy between an artificial neural network and a QBN as described in the previous reports [1, 2]. According to this analogy, we can relate a synaptic weight matrix with a Hamiltonian. We propose a quantum version of Hebb learning as follows; we enhance both excitatory and inhibitory couplings according to the probability that arbitrary two quantum bits (qubits) take the same or opposite states when a QBN outputs a desired pattern. As a first step, we trained a QBN shown in Fig. 1 to learn the XOR problem. We updated the Hamiltonian only when the hidden qubit took the state “1” in order to break symmetry because the network always learns a pair of symmetric patterns whether these patterns are desired or not. A typical successful learning result is shown in Fig. 2. Though the success rate of learning with various initial Hamiltonians reaches only 50%, this preliminary result indicates certain possibility for implementing learning function with a QBN. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Hebb learning; Quantum computing","Hamiltonians; Learning systems; Quantum optics; Qubits; Computing power; Hebb learning; Inhibitory coupling; Learning functions; Learning methods; Quantum Computing; Symmetric patterns; Synaptic weight; Neural networks","","","Y.

As such, it is useful to benchmark the performance of such computers against specific tasks that may be of interest to users, ideally keeping both the circuit depth and width as free parameters. Here, we benchmark the IBM quantum experience using the deterministic quantum computing with 1 qubit (DQC1) algorithm originally proposed by Knill and Laflamme in the context of liquid-state NMR. In the first set of experiments, we use DQC1 as a trace estimation algorithm to benchmark performance with respect to circuit depth. In the second set, we use this trace estimation algorithm to distinguish between knots, a classically difficult task which is known to be complete for DQC1. Our results indicate that the main limiting factor is the depth of the circuit and that both random and systematic errors become an issue when the gate count increases. Surprisingly, we find that at the same gate count wider circuits perform better, probably due to randomization of coherent errors. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","DQC1; IBM; Jones polynomials; NISQ; Quantum benchmarking","Quantum theory; Qubits; Random errors; Systematic errors; User experience; DQC1; Estimation algorithm; Free parameters; Jones polynomial; NISQ; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; Specific tasks; Benchmarking","Quantum Foundations With Entangled Photons and Ultracold Atoms; Quantum Foundations With Entangled Photons and Ultracold Atoms?; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","Funding text 1:  We acknowledge use of the IBM Q for this work.

Multi-tenancy has a promise of allowing better utilization of the quantum computer hardware, but also opens up the quantum computer to new types of security attacks. As this and other recent research shows, it is possible to perform a fault injection attack using crosstalk on quantum computers when a victim and attacker circuits are instantiated as co-tenants on the same quantum computer. To ensure such attacks do not happen, this paper proposes that new techniques should be developed to help catch malicious circuits before they are loaded onto quantum computer hardware. Following ideas from classical computers, a compile-time technique can be designed to scan quantum computer programs for mali-cious or suspicious code patterns before they are compiled into quantum circuits that run on a quantum computer. This paper presents ongoing work which demonstrates how crosstalk can affect Grover's algorithm, and then presents suggestions of how quantum programs could be analyzed to catch circuits that generate large amounts of crosstalk with malicious intent.  © 2022 IEEE.","","Computer hardware; Electric network analysis; Program debugging; Qubits; Anti virus; Cloud-based; Compile time; Fault injection attacks; Malicious circuits; Multi tenancies; Multiple user; Quanta computers; Recent researches; Security attacks; Crosstalk","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1901901)","This work was supported in part by NSF grant 1901901.","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166548532-6","","","English","Proc.

The core of a quantum computer is a quantum processor, which is composed of quantum bits (qubits). Qubits are fragile and their state needs to be corrected in real time by a classical controller. Today, the control of qubits is done at room temperature by racks of instruments, while qubits operate at several tens of milli-Kelvin. To ensure compactness, and eventually scalability, we have proposed the use of controllers operating at a few Kelvin, so as to reduce the length of control cables, while potentially enabling superconductive interconnects, which enable virtually zero resistance and low thermal conductivity. We have chosen CMOS to achieve this functionality due to its scalable nature and overall miniaturization opportunities. Cryogenic CMOS, or cryo-CMOS, circuits and systems need to be carefully designed, so as to ensure low noise and high bandwidth, while operating at strict power budgets of a few milliwatts per qubit. In this paper, we outline the requirements of a classical controller and we show examples of such circuits and systems. Results and perspectives are presented discussing a roadmap for the future. © 2019 IEEE.","CMOS; cryo-CMOS; cryogenics; milli-Kelvin operation; quantum computing; qubit control; qubits","Budget control; CMOS integrated circuits; Controllers; Cryogenics; Quantum optics; Solid state devices; Thermal conductivity; Circuits and systems; Classical controllers; Complex problems; Low thermal conductivity; milli-Kelvin operation; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; Superconductive interconnects; Qubits","Intel Corp.; MOS-QUITO; European Commission, EC; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","The author is grateful to the members of the coolgroup: the analysis tools, circuits, and systems presented here have been designed and tested by them, and to Intel Corp., the EU-funded project MOS-QUITO, and the Swiss National Science Foundation for funding.","E.

It features so-called digital unit cells where each cell contains all the logic necessary to interact with a single superconducting qubit. The cell includes a custom-built RISC-V-based sequencer, as well as two signal generators and a signal recorder. Internal communication within the cell is handled using a modified Wishbone bus with custom 2-to-N interconnect and deterministic broadcast functionality.

Here we give an overview of important aspects of the QI full-stack. We illustrate QI's modular system architecture and we will touch on parts of the manufacturing and electrical characterization of its first generation two spin qubit quantum processor unit.

The core of a quantum computer is a quantum processor,which is composed of quantum bits (qubits). Qubits are fragile and their state needs to be corrected in real time by a classical controller. Today,the control of qubits is done at room temperature by racks of instruments,while qubits operate at several tens of milli-Kelvin. To ensure compactness,and eventually scalability,we have proposed the use of controllers operating at a few Kelvin,so as to reduce the length of control cables,while potentially enabling superconductive interconnects,which enable virtually zero resistance and low thermal conductivity. We have chosen CMOS to achieve this functionality due to its scalable nature and overall miniaturization opportunities. Cryogenic CMOS,or cryo-CMOS,circuits and systems need to be carefully designed,so as to ensure low noise and high bandwidth,while operating at strict power budgets of a few milliwatts per qubit. In this paper,we outline the requirements of a classical controller and we show examples of such circuits and systems. Results and perspectives are presented discussing a roadmap for the future. © 2019 IEEE.","CMOS; cryo-CMOS; cryogenics; milli-Kelvin operation; quantum computing; qubit control; qubits","Budget control; CMOS integrated circuits; Controllers; Cryogenics; Quantum optics; Thermal conductivity; Circuits and systems; Classical controllers; Complex problems; Low thermal conductivity; milli-Kelvin operation; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; Superconductive interconnects; Qubits","EU-funded; Intel Corp.; MOS-QUITO; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","The author is grateful to the members of the coolgroup: the analysis tools, circuits, and systems presented here have been designed and tested by them, and to Intel Corp., the EU-funded project MOS-QUITO, and the Swiss National Science Foundation for funding.","E.

While this algorithm offers a solution for the factorization problem, which makes it exponentially faster, it alongside becomes a critical threat for the encryption schemes since mostly their security mechanisms rely on the difficulty of integer factorization or discrete log problems. Despite it is not known when advanced quantum computers will show up, yet, once it is developed, most existing cryptography will be rendered useless, which means all existing information security will be vulnerable. Owing to this risky situation, The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization process for the development of PQC schemes. In this paper, we have chosen three key encapsulation mechanisms and two digital signature algorithms with different parameter sets from the round three submissions. We measured their TLS 1.3 handshake performance using two resource-constrained devices and compared it to that of classical encryption and digital signature schemes. Experiment results showed that post-quantum algorithms come with an extra message overhead while their handshake delay values are promising.  © 2022 IEEE.","digital signature; dilithium; falcon; key encapsulation mechanism; kyber; ntru; openssl; post-quantum cryptography; saber; shor's algorithm; tls","Authentication; Digital devices; Factorization; Network security; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Seebeck effect; Falcon; Key encapsulation mechanisms; Kyber; Ntru; Open SSL; Post quantum cryptography; Resourceconstrained devices; Saber; Shor's algorithms; Tls; Electronic document identification systems","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166547010-0","","","English","Proc. - Int.

The basic design of the computer will have a core that consist of a single chip, which will sit inside an ultracold receptacle called a dilution refrigerator, encircled by a powerful superconducting magnet. In 2004, researchers have achieved initialization and readout of spins of atoms. So far, all of the requirements for a quantum computer have been realized.

Such large-scale systems require local cryogenic electronics for qubit control and readout, leaving the digital controllers for algorithm execution and quantum error correction (QEC) at room temperature due to the limited cryogenic cooling budget. The entire process, including qubit readout, data transmission, QEC, and algorithm execution, should be completed well within the qubit decoherence time, thus requiring a low-power high-speed communication link between the cryogenic quantum processor and classical processor located at room temperature. To this end, this paper presents the first cryo-CMOS high-speed 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) wireline transmitter. Thanks to a power-efficient serializing architecture driving a 6-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC), the 40-nm CMOS chip achieves a data rate of 40 Gb/s PAM4 with an efficiency of 2.46pJ/b and a ratio of level mismatch (RLM) of 97.8% at 4.2 K.

We study a novel computing structure based on these Josephson Persistent Current (PC) Bits, starting from elementary logic gates to a Random Access Memory (RAM). The investigation shows that the Josephson PC Bit technology would not surpass semiconductor technology in term of the device density, while it is a promising candidate for unltra-fast memory, which can be integrated with other technologies. The classical computer might also serve as pre and post processor for the quantum computing performed in the heart of the array.

Quantum computing motivates to use of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement for making new standard of computation which will be far different than classical computer. The quantum computing concept need to understand Qubit which is nothing but Quantum Bit that differs quantum computing from classical computing. Classical bit, which can be either Zero 0 or One 1 in single state at a time moment, a Qubit or Quantum Bit can be Zero 0 and One 1 at same time called as in superposition state. Quantum Computers will use quantum superposition and quantum entanglement are the two basic laws of quantum physics principles. Computational tasks which are non-computable by classical machine can be solved by quantum computer and these computational tasks defines heavy computations those expects large size data processing. Machine learning on classical space is very well set but it has more computational requirements based on complex and high-volume data processing. This paper surveys and propose model with integration of quantum computation and machine learning which will make sense on quantum machine learning concept. Quantum machine learning helps to enhance the various classical binary machine learning methods for better analysis and prediction of big data and information processing. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Bloch Sphere; Entanglement; QML; Qubit; Superposition; Supervised ML","","","","M.

The major issues that are faced to run a quantum algorithm reliably on these systems are: (i) lower qubit coherence period, (ii) noisy primitive gate operations, (iii) limited number of available physical qubits, and (iv) support of restricted set of 2-qubit operations. Overcoming these issues mandates physical resources that exceeds the capabilities of these noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) systems. On the other hand, computation using bare qubits get further disturbed due to the inclusion of additional gates to mitigate the nearest neighbor constraints. In the present work, the 2-dimensional square, heavy-hex and fully hexagonal qubit coupling lattices are considered for mapping quantum circuits. The benefits are assessed in terms of minimal additional gates needed to satisfy the nearest neighbor (NN) constraint and the compilation complexity of mapping circuits on these architectures. From the experiments by mapping benchmark circuits on 16-qubit square and 65-qubit heavy-hex architectures from IBM as well as on a 64-qubit fully hexagonal architecture, it is observed that none of the square or heavy-hex lattice architecture provides uniform compilation advantage compared to the fully hexagonal architecture. It is expected that beyond the NISQ era, strongly connected lattices like hexagonal will become practically feasible. © 2022 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

Classical computers work on bits whereas quantum computers work on quantum bits or qubits. A state in a qubit can be represented as |0&#x232A;,|1&#x232A; or both in | 0 &#x232A; and | 1 &#x232A; at the same time, called a superposition state. The advantage of storing a qubit in a superposition state is one can perform computation on all values at the same time, which leads to quantum parallelism. Qubits can be represented using two-dimensional vectors and there are three computational bases called Z basis, X basis, and Y basis. The next part of the chapter will discuss the various quantum gates—single qubit and multi qubit quantum gates. Output of these gates when applied to various states such as |0&#x232A;,|1&#x232A;,|+&#x232A;,|-&#x232A;,|i&#x232A;,-|i&#x232A; are discussed. The last part of this chapter will discuss the code to generate Bell states also called as quantum entanglement, the output of quantum entanglement using various visualizations supported by Qiskit such as qsphere, state_city, state_hinton, bloch sphere, etc. are explored. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Bell state; Entanglement; IBM quantum experience; Parallelism; Qiskit; Quantum state; Qubit; Real quantum device; Simulators; Superposition","","","","S.

State-of-the-art quantum processors consist of arrays of quantum bits (qubits) operating at a very low base temperature, typically a few tens of mK, as shown in Fig. 15.5.1 The qubit states degrade naturally after a certain time, upon loss of quantum coherence. For proper operation, an error-correcting loop must be implemented by a classical controller, which, in addition of handling execution of a quantum algorithm, reads the qubit state and performs the required corrections. However, while few qubits (∼10) in today's quantum processors can be easily connected to a room-temperature controller, it appears extremely challenging, if not impossible, to manage the thousands of qubits required in practical quantum algorithms [1]. © 2017 IEEE.","","CMOS integrated circuits; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Classical controllers; Computation power; Quantum algorithms; Quantum coherence; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; Scalable quantum computing; Temperature controllers; Quantum theory","","","","Fujino L.C.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","01936530","978-150903757-5","DTPCD","","English","Dig Tech Pap IEEE Int Solid State Circuits Conf","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016299418"

As such, quantum error correction is needed to fully harness the power of quantum computing (QC). Current projections indicate that > 1,000 physical qubits will be required to encode one error-corrected qubit [1]. Implementing a system with 1,000 error-corrected qubits will likely require moving from the contemporary paradigm where control and readout of the quantum processor is carried out using racks of room temperature electronics to one in which integrated control/readout circuits are located within the cryogenic environment and connected to the quantum processor through superconducting interconnects [2]. This is a major challenge, as the cryo ICs must be high performance and very low power (eventually < 1 mW/qubit).

The classical electronic controller is used to correct and manipulate the qubits, the core components of a quantum processor. To enable quantum computers scalable to millions of qubits, as required in practical applications, the simultaneous optimization of both the classical electronic and quantum systems is needed. In this paper, a co-design methodology is proposed for obtaining an optimized qubit performance while considering practical trade-offs in the control circuits, such as power consumption, complexity, and cost. The SPINE (SPIN Emulator) toolset is introduced for the co-design and co-optimization of electronic/quantum systems. It comprises a circuit simulator enhanced with a Verilog-A model emulating the quantum behavior of single-electron spin qubits. Design examples show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in the optimization, design and verification of a whole electronic/quantum system. © 2018 EDAA.","","Circuit simulation; Economic and social effects; Electrospinning; Magnetic moments; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Circuit simulators; Classical controllers; Co-design methodology; Electronic controllers; Electronic interface; Quantum processors; Simultaneous optimization; Single electron spin; Integrated circuit design","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-398192631-6","","","English","Proc.

However, a major limitation in the design of a quantum algorithm is related to the proper mapping of the corresponding circuit to a specific quantum processor so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied. Moreover, current deterministic mapping algorithms suffer from high run times as the number of qubits to map increases. To bridge the gap in view of the next generation of quantum computers composed of thousands of qubits, this data paper proposes the first datasets that help address the quantum circuit mapping problem as a classification task. Each dataset is composed of random quantum circuits mapped onto a specific IBM quantum processor. In detail, each dataset instance contains some features related to the calibration data of the physical device and others related to the generated quantum circuit. Finally, the instance is labeled with a vector encoding the best mapping among those provided by deterministic mapping algorithms. Considering this, the proposed datasets allow the development of machine learning models capable of achieving mapping similar to those achieved with deterministic algorithms, but in a significantly shorter time. © 2021 The Author(s)","Machine learning for quantum computing; Quantum circuit mapping; Quantum computing","","","","R.

Conventionally this is achieved by generating the signals at 300 K, transmitting them along very long coaxial cables that span ≥ 4 m from 300 K to sub-K (30-500 mK) into a dilution refrigerator, and reading-out the final qubit states via similar lengths of cable. Here we fabricate the control-pulse generator circuits using a foundry-processed SOS-CMOS technology that is capable of operation down to sub-K temperatures so that control signals can be generated at cryogenic temperatures in the near vicinity of the qubits. We present two full-custom large-scale integrated (LSI) control-pulse generator circuits: (a) a mixed-mode; and (b) a digital design each comprising hundreds of devices, and show pulse characteristics at 4.2 K, demonstrating LSI circuit operation at low temperatures. The mixed-mode design showed lower power dissipation but had increasing jitter at longer dwell times. The digital design eliminated jitter but at the expense of increased power dissipation. Although power dissipation is higher in the digital design, it should be possible to thermally anchor such control circuits at the 1 K stage of a dilution refrigerator thereby minimizing heat propagation to the qubits. © 2008 IEEE.","","Cables; CMOS integrated circuits; Cryogenics; Design; Digital arithmetic; Digital circuits; Digital devices; Electric cables; Electric power utilization; Jitter; LSI circuits; Nanotechnology; Networks (circuits); Pulse circuits; Refrigeration; Refrigerators; Signal generators; Telecommunication cables; Circuit operations; Cmos technologies; Control circuits; Control signals; Cryogenic temperatures; Digital designs; Dilution refrigerators; Dwell times; Generator circuits; Heat propagations; Low temperatures; Operating temperatures; Power dissipations; Pulse characteristics; Pulse generations; Quantum bits; Qubit states; Pulse generators","","","S.

Here we demonstrate excellent qubit device uniformity and tunability from 300K down to mK temperatures. This is achieved, for the first time, by integrating an overlapping polycrystalline silicon-based gate stack in an 'all-Silicon' and lithographically flexible 300mm flow. Low-disorder Si/SiO2 is proved by a 10K Hall mobility of 1.5·104 cm2/Vs. Well-controlled sensors with low charge noise (3.6 µeV/√Hz at 1 Hz) are used for charge sensing down to the last electron. We demonstrate excellent and reproducible interdot coupling control over nearly 2 decades (2-100 GHz). We show spin manipulation and single-shot spin readout, extracting a valley splitting energy of around 150 µeV. These low-disorder, uniform qubit devices and 300mm fab integration pave the way for fast scale-up to large quantum processors. © 2021 JSAP","300 mm quantum computing; Polycristalline silicon; Si-MOS quantum dots; Spin qubits","Electrospinning; Magnetic moments; MOS devices; Qubits; Semiconductor quantum dots; 300 mm quantum computing; Electron spin qubits; Large arrays; Polycristalline silicon; Quantum Computing; Qubit devices; Si-MOS quantum dot; Spin qubit; Tunabilities; Tunable coupling; Silicon","FWO-Vlaanderen, (1S60020N)","selected devices (Fig.3). The narrow Vth distribution and smooth subthreshold turn-on indicate a high quality of the nanostructure. This is further confirmed by successful formation of an electron sensing island between the left (LB) and right (RB) barrier gates, (Fig.4,5a). Noise characterization returns an expected 1/f noise power density spectrum with a low amplitude of 3.6 µeV/√Hz at 1 Hz (Fig.5b,c). SET sensing measurements verify device operation in single electron occupation for both the single-and double quantum dot mode (Fig.6,7). In the low electron-count regime, dynamic control of the tunnel coupling tc is crucial for high fidelity two-qubit gates. Coupling strength tc is extracted from the charge transition width, using a lever arm of 0.3 eV/V derived from the thermal broadening (Fig.8a,b) [7]. We show reproducible and symmetric tc control of up to 100 GHz, over nearly 2 decades, using the barrier gate voltage VB1 for two different charge transitions: (0,1)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(2,0) (Fig.8c,d). The excellent tunability and high tc achieved in the single electron regime further justify the exceptional interface quality, as required for high-fidelity qubits. For qubit operation, a static magnetic field B0 is applied, splitting the electron spin states by the Zeeman energy EZ. The spin of the last electron in the dot can be read out using a spin-to-charge conversion technique [8]. Spin lifetime T1 is extracted and shows an expected B0 dependency [9]. A relaxation hotspot, occurring when EZ matches the valley splitting EV, is measured for fields between 1.1 T and 1.3 T, corresponding to EV in the range of 127 to 150 µeV. Spin states are manipulated using Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) techniques with an on-chip antenna (Fig.9b). The extracted FWHM of ~2 MHz is consistent with that of donor bound electron spins in natural Si [10]. Conclusion & Outlook We use a novel ‘all-Silicon’ integration approach to demonstrate excellent Si-MOS spin qubit devices on natural-Si substates. Well-controlled process uniformity and high Si/SiO2 interface quality lead to reproducible electrical response across the entire temperature range (300K-mK). We demonstrate excellent tunnel coupling control in last electron regimes. This unprecedented reproducibility opens the path towards large-scale, spin-based quantum processors.

Qubits can be implemented in many flavors, but they are fragile, and their state has a tendency to decay in time. To be usable for computation, qubits must be corrected in real time by a classical controller. The controller must also see that desired computations are executed. Today, the control of qubits is performed at room temperature (RT) by racks of instruments, while the qubits operate at several tens of milli-Kelvin. To ensure compactness and, eventually, scalability, we have proposed and implemented CMOS circuits designed to operate at a few degrees Kelvin. This makes complex thermalization circuits unnecessary, potentially enabling superconductive interconnects, which would enable virtually zero resistance and low thermal conductivity. Cryogenic CMOS, or cryo-CMOS, technology was chosen to achieve classical control due to its scalable nature and overall miniaturization opportunities. Cryo-CMOS circuits and systems need to be carefully designed to ensure strict power budgets, while achieving quite advanced specifications in terms of noise and bandwidth. We review the requirements of a classical controller and cryo-CMOS circuits and systems developed for spin qubits in our lab.

QCs process information stored in quantum bits (qubits) that must be typically cooled down to cryogenic temperatures. Since state-of-the-art QCs employ only a few qubits, those qubits can be driven and read out by room-temperature electronics connected to the cryogenic qubits by only a few wires. However, practical QCs will require more than thousands of qubits, making this approach impractical due to system complexity and reliability concerns. Although frequency multiplexing would reduce the interconnects to room temperature by fitting many qubit channels in the same physical interconnect, an excessive number of interconnects would still be required. An alternative, more scalable solution is a cryogenic electronic interface operating very close to the quantum processor to keep the whole control loop at cryogenic temperature, hence avoiding any high-speed interconnect to room temperature. This system must comprise drivers, readout circuits (LNAs, ADCs), and a digital controller to steer the quantum-algorithm execution [1]. While cryogenic CMOS (cryo-CMOS) wideband drivers and LNAs supporting qubit frequency multiplexing have been shown before [1] -[3], no wideband cryo-CMOS ADC has been demonstrated yet. © 2021 IEEE.","","CMOS integrated circuits; Control systems; Cryogenics; Integrated circuit interconnects; Quantum theory; Computational problem; Cryogenic electronics; Cryogenic temperatures; Digital controllers; Frequency multiplexing; High speed interconnect; Process information; Quantum algorithms; Qubits","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","01936530","978-172819549-0","DTPCD","","English","Dig Tech Pap IEEE Int Solid State Circuits Conf","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102362726"

Typically, quantum networks fall into two categories: those utilize quantum entanglements for quantum teleportation, and those directly transfer quantum message. In this paper, we present SurfaceNet, a quantum network in the second category that employs surface codes as logical qubits for preserving and transferring message. Our approach of using surface codes can fault-tolerantly correct both operational and photon loss errors within the network. We propose a novel one-way quantum communication procedure, designed to better integrate surface codes into our network architecture. We also propose an efficient routing protocol that optimizes resource utilization for our communication procedure. Simulation results demonstrate that SurfaceNet significantly enhances the overall communication fidelity.

Among those nanoscale devices appear most promising for integration in electronic circuits and large-scale applications. We discuss Josephson junction circuits in two regimes where they can be used for quantum computing. These systems combine intrinsic coherence of the superconducting state with control possibilities of single-charge circuits. In the regime where the typical charging energy dominates over the Josephson coupling, the low-temperature dynamics is limited to two states differing by a Cooper-pair charge on a superconducting island. In the opposite regime of prevailing Josephson energy, the phase (or flux) degree of freedom can be used to store and process quantum information. Under suitable conditions the system reduces to two states with different flux configurations. Several qubits can be joined together into a register. The quantum state of a qubit register can be manipulated by voltage and magnetic field pulses. The qubits are inevitably coupled to the environment. However, estimates of the phase coherence time show that many elementary quantum logic operations can be performed before the phase coherence is lost. In addition to manipulations, the final state of the qubits has to be read out. This quantum measurement process can be accomplished using a single-electron transistor for charge Josephson qubits, and a d.c.-SQUID for flux qubits.

As other quantum security primitives and protocols, QBC improves on cheating detection over its classical counterpart. The implementation of the QBC protocol below relies on the use of common quantum gates: the Hadamard gate used for orthonormal bases and the CNOT gate used to swap qubits. The protocol was run and tested on IBM quantum experience (IBM QX). IBM QX offers two different quantum environments: as a simulator and as a real quantum machine. In our implementation, honest and dishonest participants were considered. Results of both the simulation and the quantum execution were compared against the theoretical expectations. The IBM QX simulator gives results that match the theoretical model. The IBM QX real computer deviates from the expected behavior by a measurable amount. Using the standard deviation and the Hamming distance, the conclusion is that the quantum computer is usable as the difference to the simulator is within an acceptable margin of error. The QBC protocol of choice is fully secure against cheating by Bob. The only way Alice can cheat is using multi-dimensional entanglement. The cost for Alice to cheat is exponential in the number of qubits used, namely O(2 6 n + 3 k + 1). © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","IBM QX; Quantum; Quantum bit commitment; Quantum cryptography; Real quantum processor","Hamming distance; Logic gates; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Simulators; Cheating detection; Classical counterpart; IBM QX; Quantum; Quantum bits; Quantum processors; Security primitives; Theoretical modeling; Qubits","","","N.

Main obstacles to increase the size of quantum register are fast decoherence and difficulties to control many-qubits entanglement. The clusters of the Nd3+ ions formed in the Nd3+:LaF3 crystal can be a candidate for many-qubit CNOT-gate, because of their entangled states due to strong coherent interaction (Davydov's splitting; bright and dark states with their own lifetimes τb and τd), weak electron-phonon coupling and long coherence time of the excited states. It was shown earlier that satellite lines of the main spectral line for single-site optical center of absorption [2, 3] and fluorescence excitation spectra [2] of Nd3+:LaF3 crystals can be attributed to Nd3+ ion pairs. The direct measurement of the fluorescence decay times for various classes of Nd3+ pairs was made [2] since the pairs are well selected by fluorescence excitation wavelength. © 2019 IEEE","","Electron-phonon interactions; Excited states; Ions; Lanthanum compounds; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Qubits; CNOT gate; Coherent interaction; Davydov splitting; Decoherence; Entangled state; Ion cluster; Ion pairs; Quantum Computing; Quantum register; Qubit entanglement; Fluorescence","","","","","Optica Publishing Group (formerly OSA)","21622701","978-172810469-0","","","English","Opt.

A quantum processor executes algorithms by applying a programmable sequence of gates to an initialized register of qubits, which coherently evolves into a final state containing the result of the computation. Building a quantum processor is challenging because of the need to meet simultaneously requirements that are in conflict: state preparation, long coherence times, universal gate operations and qubit readout. Processors based on a few qubits have been demonstrated using nuclear magnetic resonance, cold ion trap and optical systems, but a solid-state realization has remained an outstanding challenge. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit superconducting processor and the implementation of the Grover search and Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithms. We use a two-qubit interaction, tunable in strength by two orders of magnitude on nanosecond timescales, which is mediated by a cavity bus in a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. This interaction allows the generation of highly entangled states with concurrence up to 94 per cent. Although this processor constitutes an important step in quantum computing with integrated circuits, continuing efforts to increase qubit coherence times, gate performance and register size will be required to fulfil the promise of a scalable technology. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, the current widely-using 2D interconnect forms are not capable to meet the interconnect demand of high integration quantum processor in practical use due to wiring congestion, electromagnetic crosstalk, mechanical stress concentration, limited interior space of dilution refrigerator, etc. Therefore, quantum packaging will also need to be updated from 2D planar to 3D vertical architecture for higher integration density of superconducting qubits. In view of the current chiplet development trends in IC industry, we propose a 3D integration architecture based on the partition strategy of qubit chiplet and bus chiplet for superconducting quantum computing. This chiplet solution respectively utilizes the TSV and microbump structure in superconducting constituent material scheme to achieve low-loss intra-layer and inter-layer connection, which provides a possible technical route for modular large-scale quantum processor. To verify the feasibility of the above architecture, we design a kind of TiN-based TSV test vehicle including daisy chain structure to inspect the stabilization of DC resistance and transmission line structure for evaluation of DC/microwave signal transporting performance during the cool-down process. The TSVs in this test vehicle possess high aspect ratio (10:1, 30 µm diameter) fabricated by DRIE, coating with ~200nm TiN layer by ALD. Subsequently, Al/TiN planar wiring layer is patterned by secondary lithography and ICP process. Then morphology observation, R.T./cryogenic electrical tests are successively carried out to evaluate the performance of TSV test vehicle. SEM along with EDS reveal that the TiN coating is conformal and defect-free with nearly vertical sidewall profile. Electrical tests show that TSV structures possess satisfactory linear ohmic characteristics and a wide range of process uniformity and repeatability at R.T. Additionally, the DC resistance and S21 loss amplitude both exhibit abrupt drop during the cooling process, indicating that certain degree of superconducting transition has probably occurred. Therefore, the TiN-based TSV interposer elaborated in this paper combined with indium-based flip-chip TCB methods provides the possibility to implement 3D quantum integration architecture based on chiplet design.  © 2023 IEEE.","chiplet; flip chip; qubit; superconducting; TSV","Aspect ratio; Atomic layer deposition; Coatings; Computer architecture; Electric power transmission; Integrated circuit design; Integrated circuit interconnects; Network architecture; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Thermal management (electronics); Thermoelectric equipment; Three dimensional integrated circuits; Tin; Titanium nitride; 'current; 3-D integration; Chiplet; Flip chip; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; Superconducting; Superconducting qubits; Test vehicle; TSV; Silicon","Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, (NSFC61734004)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to appreciate the financial support from Natural Science Foundation (No.) NSFC61734004.

As shown in Fig.1-top, a frequency synthesizer is one of the main building blocks of such a cryogenic CMOS (cryo-CMOS) controller. However, designing a cryo-CMOS PLL for QC applications presents several challenges. Firstly, <60 fsec integrated jitter (σj) is required to achieve a single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.999% [2]. Secondly, to control multiple qubits with a single cable, a frequency multiplexed controller demands <-60dBc reference spur (SREF) to avoid interfering with other qubits. Thirdly, as the dilution fridge cooling power is limited, a low power consumption (PDC) is necessary to simultaneously control more qubits. Finally, PLL must be extremely robust against PVT variations, as it operates at a physical temperature of 4.2K, where no mature models are available.

However, in every research book and video that we found, the assumption is made that the student will automatically understand how those two classical bits at the end come to their values when they started as two qubits. This vagueness was unavoidable when quantum computers were purely theoretical. After exhaustive search of every quantum superdense coding Bob and Alice example in the research literature since late 2017, we found not one that presented evidence from a real quantum computer. However, moving from theory to practice is necessary.

Among them, superconducting quantum computers, with their high scalability and mature processing technology based on traditional silicon-based chips, have become the preferred solution for most commercial companies and research institutions to develop QC. However, superconducting quantum computers suffer from fluctuation due to noisy environments. To maintain reliability for every execution, calibration of the quantum processor is significantly important. During the long procedure to calibrate physical quantum bits (qubits), quantum processors must be turned into offline mode. In this work, we propose a real-time calibration framework (RCF) to execute quantum program tasks and calibrate in-demand qubits simultaneously, without interrupting quantum processors. Across a widely used noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) evaluation benchmark suite such as QASMBench, RCF achieves up to 18% reliability improvement for applications. For reliability on different physical qubits, RCF achieves an average gain of 15.7% (up to 36.7%). For cloud quantum machines, the throughput can be improved up to 9.5 throughput per minute (6.5 on average) based on baseline calibration time. In conclusion, RCF offers a reliable solution for large-scale, long-serving quantum machines.  © 2020 IEEE.","Compiler; multiprogramming; noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ); quantum computing (QC)","Benchmarking; Computation theory; Job analysis; Logic gates; Program processors; Quantum computers; Reliability analysis; Compiler; Multiprogrammings; Noise measurements; Noisy intermediate-scale quantum ,; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Quantum machines; Real-time calibration; Task analysis; Calibration","National Stroke Foundation, NSF, (CCF-1900904, CCF-2130688, CNS-210705)","This work was supported in part by the NSF under Grant CCF-2130688, Grant CCF-1900904, and Grant CNS-210705.","S.L.

We address the problem of determining a preferable adiabatic trajectory along which the qubit frequency is tuned and apply this to the flux-tunable transmon model. The especially minimal anharmonic nature of these quantum processors makes them good candidates for qubit control using non-computational states as long as higher-level leakage is properly addressed. While the statement of this method has occurred multiple times in the literature, there have been few discussions on which trajectories may be used.

Superconducting single-flux quantum (SFQ) circuits are a promising building block for qubit interface circuits because SFQ circuits can operate with high clock frequencies and low power dissipation. In the present study, we developed an SFQ-based qubit interface circuit that we refer to as a pulse-pair microwave pulse generator (PP-MPG). The PP-MPG can generate microwave pulses for qubit control, with the microwave amplitude controlled based on the delay between paired SFQ pulses. By finely adjusting the delay with delay controlling circuits, the microwave amplitude can be controlled over a wide range. We fabricated a PP-MPG chip and tested it at 4.2 K, showing that the microwave amplitude can be controlled over a range of approximately 30 dB. Our results show that the PP-MPG has the potential for use in future large-scale quantum processors. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","microwave pulse generator; qubit control; SFQ","Delay circuits; Pulse generators; Refrigerators; Interface circuits; Large-scales; Microwave amplitude; Microwave pulse; Microwave pulse generator; Pulse pairs; Quantum processors; Quantum-bit control; Single flux quantum; Single-flux quantum pulse; Low power electronics","National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, AIST; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP19H05614); New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, NEDO","This paper was based on results obtained from a project, JPNP16007, commissioned by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Japan.

A key question addressed is what such a quantum computer is and how it relates to the classical processor that controls the entire execution process. In this paper, we present explicitly the idea of a quantum accelerator which contains the full stack of the layers of an accelerator. Such a stack starts at the highest level describing the target application of the accelerator. The next layer abstracts the quantum logic outlining the algorithm that is to be executed on the quantum accelerator. In our case, the logic is expressed in the universal quantum-classical hybrid computation language developed in the group, called OpenQL, which visualised the quantum processor as a computational accelerator. The OpenQL compiler translates the program to a common assembly language, called cQASM, which can be executed on a quantum simulator. The cQASM represents the instruction set that can be executed by the micro-architecture implemented in the quantum accelerator. We propose that the industrial and societal application developers use perfect qubits that have no decoherence or error-rates. The perfect qubits offers facilities to the quantum application developer and they are not blocked by issues such as decoherence. © 2020 EDAA.","","Acceleration; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Program compilers; Quantum theory; Qubits; Application developers; Computational devices; Hybrid computation; Micro architectures; Quantum applications; Quantum processors; Quantum simulators; Target application; Computer architecture","","","","Di Natale G.; Bolchini C.; Vatajelu E.-I.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-398192634-7","","","English","Proc.

Is it possible to experimentally demonstrate algorithmic cooling usingexisting technology? To allow experimental algorithmic cooling, thethermalization time of the reset qubits must be much shorter than thethermalization time of the computation qubits.

This transformation involves multi-partite transformations. On the other hand some quantum information protocols such as the quantum teleportation and quantum dense coding are based on ce of some classes of states of bi-partite systems under the action of local (one-particle) unitary operations. In this paper we adress the question: ""Under what conditions are the two states states, ρ and σ, of a multi-partite system locally unitary equivalent?"" We present a set of conditions which have to be satisfied in order that the two states are locally unitary equivalent. In addition, we study whether it is possible to prepare a state of a multi-qudit system. Which is devided into two parts A and B, by unitary operations acting only on the systems A and B, separately.","","","","","","","","00158208","","","","English","Fortschr.

It is known that deep defects in wide-band gap semiconductors can have spin states and long coherence times suitable for qubit operation. We theoretically investigate from ab-initio density functional theory (DFT) that the defect states in the hexagonal silicon carbide (4H-SiC) are potential qubit materials. The DFT supercell calculations were performed with the local-orbital and pseudopotential methods including hybrid exchange-correlation functionals. Di-vacancies in SiC supercells yielded defect levels in the gap consisting of closely spaced doublet just above the valence band edge, and higher levels in the band gap. The divacancy with a spin state of 1 is charge neutral. The divacancy is characterized by C-dangling bonds and a Si-dangling bonds. Jahn-teller distortions and formation energies as a function of the Fermi level and single photon interactions with these defect levels will be discussed. In contrast, the anti-site defects where C, Si are interchanged have high formation energies of 5.4 eV and have just a single shallow defect level close to the valence band edge, with no spin. We will compare results including the defect levels from both the electronic structure approaches.

Quantum computers operate according to the laws of quantum physics and have the ability to be in multiple states simultaneously, and capable of performing all possible permutations at the same time. Compared with classical computers, it has achieved remarkable success in certain specific tasks. A qubit could be realized from the outermost electron of a phosphorus atom. Over the silicon crystal, an atom of phosphorus was embedded right next to a transistor. This spin of the electron is a magnetic dipole. It has two orientations, up and down, which correspond to the classical 1 and 0. To distinguish between an electron's spin up and spin down energy state, application of a strong magnetic field is required. A pulse of microwave energy can be used to write information onto a qubit by spinning it up, but the frequency must be extremely precise. Electrons oscillate at a specific frequency depending on the magnetic field they are in. As a spin down, the energy is lower, whereas that of a spin up is higher. Now, in this transistor, there is in fact a little pool of electrons; this pool of electrons is filled up to certain energy level. With 50–100 qubits, quantum computers may be able to perform tasks that are beyond the capabilities of today's classical computers. © 2023, The Institution of Engineers (India).","Classical computer; Encryption; Information; Quantum computer; Qubit; States; Superimposition","Electrons; Magnetic fields; Phosphorus; Qubits; Standardization; Classical computer; Human perception; Information; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Quantum physics; Spin-down; Spin-up; State; Superimposition; Cryptography","","","A.

At the same time, this kind of qubit exhibits high-performance fidelity and decoherence time and requires a programmable arbitrary waveform generator (AWG). This paper presents the implementation of an AWG with a sampling rate of two-gigabit samples per second as well as 16-bit vertical resolution digital-to-analog converters. The AWGs are designed for a scaled-up usage scenario by integrating them with separate microwave devices onto a single backplane. A special waveform sequence output controller is designed to realize seamless waveform switching and arbitrary waveform generation. The jitter of multiple AWG channels is around 10 ps, and the integral nonlinearity and differential nonlinearity are both about 2 least significant bits. This customizable AWG has been used in several superconducting quantum processors, and the result of multiple qubits' measurement verifies that the AWG is qualified for controlling tens of superconducting qubits. © 2019 Author(s).","","Digital to analog conversion; Electric generators; Microwave devices; Qubits; Waveform analysis; Arbitrary waveform generation; Arbitrary waveform generator; Differential nonlinearity; Integral nonlinearity; Least significant bits; Semiconductor process; Superconducting qubits; Vertical resolution; Quantum optics","Center for Excellence and Synergetic Innovation Center in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (U1738202); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, (2017500); University of Science and Technology of China, USTC","This work has been supported by Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Center for Excellence and Synergetic Innovation Center in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, Shanghai Branch, University of Science and Technology of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1738202); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2017500).","","","American Institute of Physics Inc.","21583226","","","","English","AIP Adv.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075268722"

In parallel to the physical implementation of quantum processors, quantum algorithms have been actively developed for real-life applications to show quantum advantages, many of which benefit from quantum arithmetic algorithms and their efficient implementations. As one of the most important operations, quantum addition has been adopted in Shor's algorithm and quantum linear algebra algorithms. Although various least-significant digit-first quantum adders have been introduced in previous work, interest in investigating the efficient implementation of most-significant digit-first addition is growing. In this work, we propose a novel design method for most-significant digit-first addition with several quantum circuit optimisations to reduce the number of quantum bits (i.e. qubits), quantum gates, and circuit depth. An open-source library of different arithmetic operators based on our proposed method is presented, where all circuits are implemented on IBM Qiskit SDK. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed design, together with the optimisation techniques, reduces T-depth by up-to 4.0×, T-count by 3.5×, and qubit consumption by 1.2×.  © 1968-2012 IEEE.","Most-significant digit-first arithmetic; quantum circuits; quantum computing","Adders; Computation theory; Computer architecture; Computer circuits; Linear algebra; Logic circuits; Quantum efficiency; Quantum optics; Qubits; Timing circuits; Arithmetic; Design space exploration; Efficient implementation; Most significant digit first; Most-significant digit-first arithmetic; Optimisations; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; Logic gates","","","H.

It harnesses the law of quantum mechanics that aids in solving highly complex problems. The law incorporates the concept of superposition and entanglement, which are the primary properties of quantum. The qubits are those involved in quantum, with the feasibility that a bit can represent any of the two states, unlike classical computers. With the advent of the new technology, it is important to enhance the other units that support in building up the technology of the future. This chapter proposes the different aspects involved in quantum computing, such as quantum sensors, the processing of quantum, the networks established, etc. It also emphasizes on the importance of moving from the classical computers to quantum, with comparisons. The focus is on knowing that there is the possibility of quantum computing in solving problems that cannot be solved in polynomial time. All these aid in uplifting the classic computing power to quantum. As it is understood that this technology is still in the research stage, the chapter provides information on what it is to actually build a quantum system.

We here report on recent experimental advancements towards a quantum computer with such a system. Laser-cooled trapped ions are ideally suited systems for the investigation and implementation of quantum information processing as one can gain almost complete control over their internal and external degrees of freedom. The combination of a Paul type ion trap with laser cooling leads to unique properties of trapped cold ions, such as control of the motional state down to the zero-point of the trapping potential, a high degree of isolation from the environment and thus a very long time available for manipulations and interactions at the quantum level. The very same properties make single trapped atoms and ions well suited for storing quantum information in long-lived internal states, e.g. by encoding a quantum bit (qubit) of information within the coherent superposition of the S1/2 ground state and the metastable D5/2 excited state of Ca+. Recently we have achieved the implementation of simple algorithms with up to 3 qubits on an ion-trap quantum computer. We will report on methods to implement single qubit rotations, the realization of a two-qubit universal quantum gate (Cirac-Zoller CNOT-gate), the deterministic generation of two-ion entangled states (Bell states) and three-ion entangled states (GHZ- and W-states [1]), the realization of a quantum register, the full tomographic reconstruction of the density matrix of such entangled states, the realization of deterministic quantum teleportation [2], quantum process tomography of this teleportation protocol and the encoding of quantum information in decoherence-free subspaces with decoherence times on a second-timescale. © 2005 IEEE.","","Algorithms; Encoding (symbols); Image reconstruction; Ion sources; Tomography; Ion traps; Quantum computers; Quantum computing; Quantum information processing; Quantum electronics","Institut für Quanteninformation Ges.mbH; Army Research Office, ARO; Marie Curie; European Commission, EC; Austrian Science Fund, FWF","We thank Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler, Wolfgang Hänsel, Stephan Gulde, Mark Riebe, Gavin Lancaster, Jürgen Eschner, Christoph Becher, Michael Chwalla, Jan Benhelm, Umakant Rapol, Timo Körber, Thomas Monz, Philipp Schindler, Kihwan Kim and Piet Schmidt for their ideas, work on the ion trap apparatus and moral support.

Quantum error correction provides this protection by distributing a logical state among many physical quantum bits (qubits) by means of quantum entanglement. Superconductivity is a useful phenomenon in this regard, because it allows the construction of large quantum circuits and is compatible with microfabrication. For superconducting qubits, the surface code approach to quantum computing is a natural choice for error correction, because it uses only nearest-neighbour coupling and rapidly cycled entangling gates. The gate fidelity requirements are modest: the per-step fidelity threshold is only about 99 per cent. Here we demonstrate a universal set of logic gates in a superconducting multi-qubit processor, achieving an average single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.92 per cent and a two-qubit gate fidelity of up to 99.4 per cent. This places Josephson quantum computing at the fault-tolerance threshold for surface code error correction. Our quantum processor is a first step towards the surface code, using five qubits arranged in a linear array with nearest-neighbour coupling. As a further demonstration, we construct a five-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state using the complete circuit and full set of gates. The results demonstrate that Josephson quantum computing is a high-fidelity technology, with a clear path to scaling up to large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum circuits. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","","quantum dot; array; computer simulation; database; error analysis; linearity; quantum mechanics; threshold; tolerance; article; microprocessor; microtechnology; priority journal; quantum mechanics; quantum theory; scale up; superconductor; surface property","Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-09-1-0375, W911NF-10-1-0334); Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ODNI; Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, IARPA","Acknowledgements We thank F.

It becomes one of the most promising candidates for realizing practical quantum computer/simulator, because of its scalability, easy to coupling and control, compatibility to semiconductor technologies, etc. As the complicated electromagnetic environment in solid state metal and insulator, superconducting quantum bits (qubits) suffered from shot coherence time since its early development. In this review, we described some recently developed superconducting qubit structures, including Transmon/Xmon, Fluxonium and C-shunt flux qubit. Although these new qubit structures have very different circuit parameters and energy scales, they all find their way to effectively suppress environmental noises. As a result, their coherence time were improved significantly. Transmon, a transmission-line shunted plasma oscillation qubit, was now among the most popular structures for building a multi-qubit superconducting quantum circuit. It introduced a relatively large shunt capacitor to remarkably reduce the charge dispersion. Although the non-linearity is also decreased, by operating in a properly chosen EJ/Ec, transmon can greatly reduce the charge noise while only sacrificing a small amount of non-linearity. Xmon can be considered as a modified version of transmon. It is designed and optimized for multi-qubit operation and measurement with separate X/Y and Z control lines for each qubit, and a readout bus (a transmission line or a low-Q bandpass filter) for simultaneous readout of all the qubits. Fluxonium provide another solution for suppressing the charge noise in Cooper-pair box (CPB). It introduces a large shunt inductance to filter low-frequency offset charge in the small capacitor of the phase-slip junction (the small junction). To keep the qubit operating in the charge region, the shunt inductor should be large enough to keep the impedance larger than the superconducting impedance quantum RQ~1 kΩ. As a result, the inductance can only be provided by a large series of Josephson junctions. Fluxonium keeps the advantage of high anharmonicity of CPB. In addition, it introduces another degree of freedom: external flux Φext. Quasiparticles (electrons or holes) tunneling at the small junction add coherently to produce a ""1+cosφ"" term. As a result, when Φext=Φ0/2, dissipation caused by quasiparticle tunneling is suppressed and the energy relaxation time (T1) increases drastically. C-shunt flux qubit (CSFQ) decreases α and EJ to suppress flux noise in the qubit. While the charge noise becomes the dominant noise source, a large shunt capacitor is added to suppress the charge noise, similar to that in a transmon qubit. It is worth to notice that in CSFQ, the α decreases to below but near ½. As a result, the double-well potential no longer exists. The energy structure become similar to transmon, with the anharmonicity be opposite. CSFQ can get a much improved coherence time, while its anharmonicity can be larger than that of transmon. Those new superconducting qubit structures provide different solutions to improve the coherence time. Although it looks much different in circuit models and parameters, they have ideas in common, and may act as guides to other novel designs with longer coherence time. We can summarize as below. (1) The qubit circuit should be free of small superconducting islands. Charge fluctuation in small islands is a major source of decoherence. As a result, increase the area of the islands, that is, increase the capacitance becomes a straight forward way to suppress the charge noise. In Fluxonium, the small junction is connected with a large series of large junctions that there is also no small islands in the whole loop. (2) Remove superconducting loops in the qubit circuit, or minimize the loop size and loop current to suppress flux noise. (3) Bias the phase difference of the small junction to π, where dissipation caused by quasiparticle tunneling can be suppressed coherently. (4) Decrease the coupling bandwidth of qubit to the environment. In a circuit-QED readout scheme, a high-Q readout resonator that dispersively coupled to the qubit protects the qubit from exposed to the electromagnetic environment of the readout circuit. A ""Purcell filter"" can also be added to suppress such decoherence further. In conclusion, we overviewed some qubit engineering techniques or ideas to improve the coherence time, which is a very important figure for building practical quantum computer/simulator. We hope that someone can combine and optimize these ideas, while interact with developments in materials and micro-fabrication technologies, to develop novel new generation superconducting qubit structures in the near future. © 2017, Science Press.

Circulators are widely used in readout circuits, however they are typically discrete bulky devices, thus preventing miniaturization. To address this issue, we propose a fully integrated 40-nm CMOS 6.5-GHz circulator operating from 300 K to 4.2 K. At 300 K, it achieves a 2.2-dB insertion loss, an 18-dB isolation, and a 2.4-dB noise figure over the 1-dB bandwidth from 5.6 GHz to 7.4 GHz, with a core power of only 2.5 mW. This improves to 2.1 mW core power at 4.2 K, while showing 1.3-dB insertion loss and 17-dB isolation over the 1-dB bandwidth from 5.8 GHz to 7.6 GHz. The circuit achieves a record-low core power and a 1.6× wider fractional bandwidth than the state-of-the-art, thus allowing its use for multiple channels in power-constrained cryogenic refrigerators. These advances are enabled by a fully-passive architecture based on LC all-pass filters, allowing the use of a lower clock frequency than in prior art. © 2019 IEEE.","circulator; Cryo-CMOS; quantum computing; qubit; qubit readout; spin qubit; superconducting qubit","Bandwidth; CMOS integrated circuits; Cryogenics; Insertion losses; Light polarization; Microwave filters; Noise figure; Passive filters; Quantum theory; Qubits; Radio waves; Readout systems; circulator; Quantum Computing; qubit; Qubit read-out; Spin qubit; Superconducting qubits; All-pass filters","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (688539)","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15292517","978-172811701-0","","","English","Dig.

We present our calculations of the decoherence of the coupled ion-charge system due to the charge fluctuations in the solid-state system and the dissipation of the superconducting cavity under laser radiation. A gate scheme that exploits rapid state flips of the charge qubit to reduce decoherence by the charge noise is designed. We also study a superconducting switch that is inserted between the cavity and the charge qubit and provides tunable coupling between the qubits.

The decoherence times of transitions corresponding to the same quantum order (single quantum, respectively two-quantum order) are approximately equal. But the higher the quantum order, the faster the decoherence. It is discussed that this is due to the dipolar interactions between the spins.

Low ambient temperature is also favorable to lower the noise of electronics, which is critical for quantum computing applications. Qubit control requires microwave signals modulated by baseband arbitrary waveform envelopes, so as to generate 10ns-to-100ns periodic pulsed signals to manipulate the qubit state [1].In order to prevent qubit state dephasing, the carrier should have a precision better than 1.9kHz (rms). The signal noise bandwidth should be limited from above by the qubit operation speed and from below by the echo-period [1]. To ensure scalability, signal sources should be tunable in a wide range, e.g., 3-to-9GHz for superconducting qubits, assuming enough margin to adapt to PVT variations. To address these constraints, a cryo-CMOS class F2, 3 LC-tank voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) was first reported in [1], with a precision of 3.95kHz (rms) at 4.2K and a power consumption of 7-to-19mW with FTR of 5.7-to-7.3 GHz. In [2], a cryo-CMOS 4.4-to-5.3GHz class D/F2 VCO with an automatic common-mode resonance calibration was presented. Both VCOs suffer from the near-carrier phase noise (PN), i.e., flicker noise region, increasing at CT.Although harmonic-rich tanks have been employed in these designs to suppress flicker noise, the 1/f corners were still easily increased from hundreds of kHz at room temperature (RT) to several MHz at CT. The deterioration of 1/f noise for VCOs can cause difficulties in cryo-CMOS PLL designs for quantum interface applications.  © 2022 IEEE.","","BiCMOS technology; Circuit oscillations; Cryogenics; Deterioration; Phase noise; Qubits; Si-Ge alloys; Variable frequency oscillators; Class B; Control electronics; Cryogenic temperatures; Flicker noise; Frequency tuning range; Low ambient temperatures; Mode-switching; Quantum control; Quantum processors; Qubit state; Oscillistors","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","01936530","978-166542800-2","DTPCD","","English","Dig Tech Pap IEEE Int Solid State Circuits Conf","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128282593"

The states of the qubits, manipulated with magnetic fields and measured with a SQUID, can be brought into quantum coherence to perform quantum computing. Classical bits can also be obtained from these superconducting loops by increasing its critical current, making it possible to base a processor array architecture on these cubits (quantum bits used in a classical way). Such a classical computer might also serve as pre and post processor for the quantum computing performed in the heart of the array. Because classical and quantum computing based on the same device can be studied now simultaneously, architecture of arrays of qubits and cubits seems a good vehicle for studying the quantum computer paradigm, independently from the question whether superconducting loops will be the ultimate implementation vehicle. Other (e.g. spin-based) devices may be more successful. In this paper, the architectural issues of a heterogeneous quantum/classical computer for an implementation of Shor's factoring algorithm based on arrays of qubits and cubits, are presented.","","Critical currents; Magnetic field effects; SQUIDs; Superconducting electric lines; Quantum bit; Quantum computing; Quantum electronics","","","","","","","","00221","","English","Comput Archit Mach Percept CAMP Proc","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033725019"

Independent high-resolution DACs that set the amplitude and pulse-width of the control signals were integrated for each qubit,enabling both a programmable semiconductor qubit operation and a per-qubit individual calibration that compensates for the process variability. The lower deco-herence time of the semiconductor charge-qubits as compared to their spin-qubit counterparts was mitigated by using a high frequency of control unit operation. This is facilitated by the co-integration on the same die of the semiconductor quantum structures together with their corresponding classic control circuitry. The main challenge of achieving deep cryogenic operation for the mixed-signal classic control circuit was surpassed by using programmable local heating DACs that slightly boost the local temperature of the control blocks above the average temperature of the die,which needs to be maintained around 4 K to enable a reliable quantum operation. A staged multi-phase operation was adopted for the digital core in order to minimize the quantum decoherence originated in digital noise injection. The high-frequency clock tree and divider allows the generation of sub-20 ps fast edge control pulses with programmable widths down to 166 ps. This offers a wide quantum computation window when compared with the 1μs decoherence time of the charge-qubit structures. © 2019 IEEE.","","Application specific integrated circuits; Computer control systems; Mixed signal integrated circuits; Programmable logic controllers; Quantum optics; System-on-chip; Cryogenic operations; High frequency clocks; Individual calibrations; Process Variability; Quantum decoherence; Quantum operations; Quantum processors; Semiconductor quantum structures; Qubits","","","I.

Therefore, the result generated will be the superimposition of the qubits as if all the instructions within the group were executed simultaneously.

The use of quantum computing allows accelerating the solution of several economic problems, logistics, virology, and many high technologies, which determines the financing of this area's basic research around the world. The goal of the article is to study algorithms for solving routing problems on quantum computers. It should be noted that modern quantum computers have significant limitations on both the number of qubits and the number of connections between qubits or the limited depth of the circuit. In addition, modern quantum computers can give only approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, which is a consequence of the imperfection of technologies for creating and maintaining the stability of quantum states and many other physical limitations. This means that many routing algorithms will not soon be able to run on quantum computers. Therefore, the authors limited the review of quantum algorithms for solving the problem of vehicle routing to a list of algorithms that have been tested on real quantum computers and for which the source code for programs is given by their developers. Algorithms and computational schemes for solving the problem of vehicle routing on modern hybrid quantum-classical cloud services of IBM and D-wave, as well as quantum computer simulators, are studied and discussed. © 2022 CEUR-WS.

The proposed method avoids this problem by eliminating a part of elements in the density matrices.

Even we cannot clearly envision at present what the hardware of that machine will be like. Nevertheless, we can be quite confident that it will be much easier to build any practical quantum computer operating on a few number of quantum bits rather than one operating on a huge number of quantum bits. It is therefore of big practical impact to use the resource of quantum bits very spare, i. e., to find quantum algorithms which use as few as possible quantum bits. Here, we present a method to reduce the number of actually needed qubits in Shor's algorithm to factor a composite number N. Exploiting the inherent probabilism of quantum computation we are able to substitute the continued fraction algorithm to find a certain unknown fraction by a simultaneous Diophantine approximation. While the continued fraction algorithm is able to find a Diophantine approximation to a single known fraction with a denominator greater than N2, our simultaneous Diophantine approximation method computes in polynomial time unusually good approximations to known fractions with a denominator of size N1+ɛ, where ɛ is allowed to be an arbitrarily small positive constant. As these unusually good approximations are almost unique we are able to recover an unknown denominator using fewer qubits in the quantum part of our algorithm. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.","","Cryptography; Factorization; Polynomial approximation; Quantum optics; Qubits; Composite numbers; Continued fraction algorithm; Diophantine approximation; Factorization algorithms; Positive constant; Quantum algorithms; Shor's algorithms; Simultaneous Diophantine approximation; Approximation algorithms","","","","Naccache D.; Gemplus Card International, 34 rue Guynemer, Issy les Moulineaux, 92447","Springer Verlag","03029743","3540418989; 978-354041898-6","","","English","Lect.

Here, for the first time, we demonstrate a recently introduced method that breaks a circuit into smaller subcircuits or fragments, and thus makes it possible to run circuits that are either too wide or too deep for a given quantum processor. We investigate the behavior of the method on one of IBM's 20-qubit superconducting quantum processors with various numbers of qubits and fragments. We build noise models that capture decoherence, readout error, and gate imperfections for this particular processor. We then carry out noisy simulations of the method in order to account for the observed experimental results. We find an agreement within 20% between the experimental and the simulated success probabilities, and we observe that recombining noisy fragments yields overall results that can outperform the results without fragmentation. © 2020 IEEE.","Fragmentation; Noise models; Noisy simulation; Quantum algorithms; Quantum computing","Quantum optics; VLSI circuits; Decoherence; Decoherence time; Noise models; Quantum processors; Sub-circuits; Qubits","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC, (DE-AC02-06CH11357, DE-AC05-00OR22725)","This research used resources of the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, which is a DOE Office of Science User Facility supported under Contract DE-AC05-00OR22725.

Conventionally, for solid-state qubits, this is achieved by generating the control signal at 300 K and transmitting it along very long coaxial cables that span from 300 K to sub-K (typically < 500 mK), then reading out the response from charge proximity sensors such as single-electron transistors along similar lengths of cable. Our approach is to fabricate the classical controller and observer circuits using a commercial foundry processed silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) RF-CMOS technology for operation at low temperatures (either at 4.2 K, 1 K, or sub-K). We have demonstrated SOS-CMOS NFET and PFET device operation at 4.2 K, and sub-K that showed deviations from their 300 K characteristics, but with further experiments these were shown to have minimal effects on control circuit function. Using these results, we have fabricated and demonstrated a low-power proof-of-concept SOS-CMOS controller circuit (monostable 100 ps voltage-pulse generator) that can operate at sub-K temperatures in a dilution refrigerator. We briefly discuss experimental and conceptual schemes with which we can develop qubit control systems for cryogenic and lower temperatures. These low temperature experiments also demonstrate that commercial SOS RF-CMOS technology can be feasible for other low temperature and low power applications. © 2007 IEEE.","CMOSFETs; Control systems; Cryogenic electronics; Quantum effect semiconductor devices","Cables; Control theory; Corundum; Electric cables; Experiments; Nanotechnology; Networks (circuits); Nonmetals; Observability; Optical design; Pulse circuits; Pulse generators; Semiconductor switches; Signal generators; Silicon; Silicon on sapphire technology; Technology; Telecommunication cables; CMOS technologies; CMOSFETs; Control circuits; Control signalling; Cryogenic electronics; Device operations; Dilution refrigerators; International conferences; Low power applications; Low powers; Low temperature; Low temperature experiments; Low temperatures; Minimal effects; Monostable; Observer systems; Proof of concepts; Quantum bit; Quantum effect semiconductor devices; Qubit gates; Rapid control; RF-CMOS; Silicon-on-sapphire; Single-electron transistors; Solid-state qubits; Control systems","","","S.

We have developed a single-flux-quantum (SFQ) microwave chopper for high-speed switching of microwave pulses. The proposed chopper is composed of a DC/SFQ convertor, an SFQ switch, a PTL driver, and a superconducting low-pass filter (LPF). The chopper converts an input microwave, which is generated by an external microwave generator at the room temperature, into microwave pulses by using start/stop SFQ control signals. We designed and implemented a microwave chopper module, which can be attached to dilution refrigerators. SFQ chips were fabricated using the ISTEC 2.5 kA/cm2 Nb process. We tested the microwave chopper module at 4.2 K, and demonstrated that a 5-GHz microwave whose amplitude ranging from 0 μV to 150 μV can be chopped by the SFQ control signals.. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, their quantum coherence time is usually too short for that purpose. In the quantronium circuit, a built-in decoupling of the qubit from its environment allows one to circumvent this limitation. For this device, qubit states are prepared by applying resonant microwave pulses, and the read-out is performed by monitoring the switching of a large Josephson junction. The phenomena that limit quantum coherence, and strategies to fight them, are discussed. © 2005 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte.

A quantum program is modeled as a Clifford+T quantum circuit that needs to be optimized in order to comply with quantum technology constraints. Most of the optimization algorithms aim at reducing the number of T gates. Nevertheless, a secondary optimization objective should be to minimize the number of two-qubit operations (the CNOT gates) as they show lower fidelity and higher error rate when compared to single-qubit operations. We have developed an exact SAT-based algorithm for quantum circuit rewriting that aims at reducing CNOT gates without increasing the number of T gates. Our algorithm finds the minimum {CNOT, T} circuit for a given phase polynomial description of a unitary transformation. Experiments confirm a reduction of CNOT in T-optimized quantum circuits. We synthesize quantum circuits for all single-target gates whose control functions are one of the representatives of the 48 spectral equivalence classes of all 5-input Boolean functions.

In such systems, the control electronics is expected to operate in the proximity of the qubits at extremely low temperature (e.g. \leq 4\ \mathrm{K}). While MOSFET devices from commercial technologies would still function as transistors at cryogenic temperatures, their behaviors deviate from what are expected by the current models developed and characterized for higher temperatures.

Increasing the qubit count to run meaningful quantum algorithms would require multiple traps where ions need to shuttle between traps to communicate. The existing compiler has several limitations, which result in a high number of shuttle operations and degraded fidelity. In this paper, we target this gap and propose compiler optimizations to reduce the number of shuttles. Our technique achieves a maximum reduction of 51.17% in shuttles (average 33%) tested over 125 circuits. Furthermore, the improved compilation enhances the program fidelity up to 22.68X with a modest increase in the compilation time. © 2022 EDAA.","Compiler; Quantum Computing; Qubit; Shuttle; Trapped-Ion","Program compilers; Quantum theory; Qubits; Ion qubits; Ion systems; Multiple traps; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Qubit; Shuttle; Shuttle operations; Trapped ion; Trapped ions","Penn State Huck Institute of the Life Sciences; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DGE-2113839, OIA-2040667); Institute for Computational and Data Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, ICDS","This work is supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) (OIA-2040667 and DGE-2113839) and seed grants from Penn State Institute for Computational and Data Sciences (ICDS) and Penn State Huck Institute of the Life Sciences.","","Bolchini C.; Verbauwhede I.; Vatajelu I.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-398192636-1","","","English","Proc.

Distributed quantum computing provides a scalable path to execute more complicated computational tasks that a single quantum processor cannot handle. Yet, distributed quantum computing needs a new compiler to map logical qubits of a quantum circuit to different quantum processors in the system. This paper formulates and studies the qubit allocation problem for distributed quantum computing (QA-DQC). We prove the NP-hardness of the formulated problem. Moreover, we show there is no polynomial-time na-approximation algorithm for any a < 1 unless P = NP, where n is the number of processors in the quantum network. We first propose a heuristic local search algorithm for QA-DQC. Furthermore, we design a multistage hybrid simulated annealing algorithm (MHSA) by combining the local search algorithm and a simulated annealing meta-heuristic algorithm. Lastly, we perform extensive simulations to evaluate the proposed MHSA under various real quantum circuits and different network topologies. Results show that MHSA outperforms popular baselines. © 2023 IEEE.","","Approximation algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Local search (optimization); Polynomial approximation; Program compilers; Quantum communication; Quantum optics; Qubits; Allocation problems; Computational task; Distributed quantum computing; Hybrid simulated annealing algorithm; Local search algorithm; Multi-stages; Quantum circuit; Quantum computing systems; Quantum processors; Single quantum; Simulated annealing","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS-2231040)","IX.

An optical quantum computer, which encodes quantum information in single photons, has emerged as a leading approach. Single photons make excellent quantum bits, or qubits (two level quantum mechanical systems), because they are very well isolated from their environment. This approach is quite opposite to all other physical systems exhibiting-mechanical phenomena, which are typically very small and very cold as they are subject to numerous disturbances from their environment. Knill, Laflamme and Milburn (KLM) scheme model, which is based on inducing such a nonlinearly via single photon detection, was proposed in 2001.

So when Lov Grover developed a search for Quantum Computers that could obtain results that were not only faster but impossible to obtain on classical computers (Grover 1996), researches began to look for more ways to utilize this new computing paradigm for Artificial Intelligence. Work has been done with Quantum Neural Networks and various learning problems (Ventura & Martinez 2000) and applications of quantum searches (Grover 1997). Unfortunately, quantum computation is very different than classical computation. Quantum bits, qubits, can exist in a super position of both 1 and 0, something roughly equivalent to being both 1 and 0 at the same time. This new type of Information has forced researchers to develop new gates to manipulate qubits. There are also many new issues that must be dealt with as a result of the Quantum Mechanical nature of these computers. All of this makes developing new quantum mechanical algorithms difficult to approach. What this paper presents is a general framework for quantum mechanical gates that allows for a unified way in approaching quantum algorithm design.","","Artificial intelligence; Quantum computers; Computing paradigm; Learning problem; Quantum algorithms; Quantum bits; Quantum mechanical; Quantum neural networks; Quantum search; Super position; Quantum theory","","","","","","","","","","English","Proc.

Quantum sorting plays a critical role in creating ordered sets of data that can be better utilized, e.g., quantum ordered search or quantum network switching. In this paper, we propose a quantum sorting algorithm that combines highly parallelizable bitonic merge networks with perfect shuffle permutations (PSP), for sorting data represented in the quantum domain. The combination of bitonic networks with PSP improves the temporal complexity of bitonic merge sorting which is critical for reducing decoherence effects for quantum processing. We present space-efficient quantum circuits that can be used for quantum bit comparison and permutation. We also present a reconfigurable hardware quantum emulator for prototyping the proposed quantum algorithm. The emulator has a fully-pipelined architecture and supports double-precision floating-point computations, resulting in high throughput and accuracy. The proposed hardware architectures are implemented on a high-performance reconfigurable computer (HPRC). In our experiments, we emulated quantum sorting circuits of up to 31 fully-entangled quantum bits on a single FPGA node of the HPRC platform. To the best of our knowledge, our effort is the first to investigate a reconfigurable hardware emulation of quantum sorting using bitonic networks and perfect shuffle. © 2019 IEEE.","High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing; Quantum Computation; Quantum Emulation","Digital arithmetic; Digital storage; Network architecture; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Reconfigurable architectures; Reconfigurable hardware; Sorting; Decoherence effects; Fully pipelined architecture; Hardware architecture; High performance reconfigurable computing; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Emulation; Reconfigurable computer; Research interests; Quantum efficiency","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172815999-7","","","English","Proc.

Earth observation (EO) has inevitably arrived in the big data era, but the high requirement on computation power has already become a bottleneck for analyzing large amounts of remote sensing data with sophisticated machine learning models. Exploiting quantum computing might contribute to a solution to tackle this challenge by leveraging quantum properties. This article introduces a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QC-CNN) that applies quantum computing to effectively extract high-level critical features from EO data for classification purposes. Besides that, the adoption of the amplitude encoding technique reduces the required quantum bit resources. The complexity analysis indicates that the proposed model can accelerate the convolutional operation in comparison with its classical counterpart. The model&#x2019;s performance is evaluated with different EO benchmarks, including Overhead-MNIST, So2Sat LCZ42, PatternNet, RSI-CB256, and NaSC-TG2, through the TensorFlow Quantum platform, and it can achieve better performance than its classical counterpart and have higher generalizability, which verifies the validity of the QC-CNN model on EO data classification tasks.

Its power is derived from a quantum bit (qubit) that can simultaneously exist in a superposition of both zero and one states and become entangled with other qubits. It has been shown that quantum computers can speed up algorithms and, potentially, model any physical process [2]. QC is now the main driver behind the phenomenal development of cryogenic CMOS, or cryo-CMOS [3]. The starting point was the sudden emergence of rudimentary quantum computers from obscure physics labs [4]. In the past, there was simply no sufficient motivation to go through the pain of designing IC circuits at deep cryogenic temperatures, where the silicon substrate is known to freeze out electrically and where no Spice models exist. Hence, we cannot find any remarkable literature related to cryo-CMOS from back then. Now that cryo-CMOS work has seriously begun, the designed circuits are being deployed for other applications, such as astronomy and physics experiments [5]-[12].  © 2009-2012 IEEE.","","Application specific integrated circuits; CMOS integrated circuits; Cryogenics; Qubits; SPICE; Supercomputers; System-on-chip; Cryogenic temperatures; Fundamental principles; Material science; Physical process; Physics experiments; Quantum bit (qubit); Quantum Computing; Silicon substrates; Quantum entanglement","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","19430582","","","","English","IEEE Solid State Circ.

The number of gates and the circuit depth vary in such transformation depending on the type of ancilla used (clean or dirty). The present Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have limited number of coherent qubits with faulty native operation support. Superconducting devices also have coupling restrictions or Nearest-Neighbor (NN) constraints, which require additional gates to map the transformed netlist for execution. While the mapping overhead is correlated with the number of 2-qubit gates and involved qubits, the fidelity of execution is inversely proportional to the number of gates and circuit depth. There is a tradeoff in devising the transpilation (i.e. low-level transformation and mapping) approach — dirty ancilla demands less qubits and overhead at the expense of more gates and depth as compared to clean ancilla, which involves less gates and depth at the expense of more qubits and overhead. This paper analyzes the disparity in gates, depth and qubits between: (i) the low-level transformation approaches without considering device coupling information, and (ii) the mapping schemes based on netlist transformation using a specific type of ancilla. We analyze the benefits of using NN-constraints at the transformation stage, and the impact of distributing clean ancilla across architectures. We have carried out experiments on IBM Q20 and Hexagonal Q20 architectures, which show improvements of 17% and 13% respectively in terms of number of gates. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Architecture-aware decomposition; Clean and dirty ancilla; Quantum circuits; Qubit mapping","Qubits; Timing circuits; Ancilla; Architecture-aware decomposition; Clean and dirty ancillum; Level transformation; Nearest-neighbour; Netlist; Number of gates; Quantum circuit; Qubit mapping; Toffoli gates; Mapping","","","K.

In classical computers, the security of these protocols depends on the mathematical complexity of the encoding functions and on the length of the key. However, the existing classical algorithms 100% breakable with enough computational power, which can be provided by quantum machines. Moving to quantum computation, the field of security shifts into a new area of cryptographic solutions which is now the field of quantum cryptography. The era of quantum computers is at its beginning. There are few practical implementations and evaluations of quantum protocols. Therefore, the paper defines a well-known quantum key distribution protocol which is BB84 then provides a practical implementation of it on IBM QX software. The practical implementations showed that there were differences between BB84 theoretical expected results and the practical implementation results. Due to this, the paper provides a statistical analysis of the experiments by comparing the standard deviation of the results. Using the BB84 protocol the existence of a third-party eavesdropper can be detected. Thus, calculations of the probability of detecting/not detecting a third-party eavesdropping have been provided. These values are again compared to the theoretical expectation.

A recent paper [A. Kandala et al., Nature 567, 491 (2019)] described a method for injecting noise by stretching gate times, enabling the calculation of quantum expectation values as a function of the amount of noise in the IBM-Q devices. Extrapolating to zero noise led to excellent agreement with exact results. Here an alternative scheme is described that employs the intentional addition of identity pulses, pausing the device periodically in order to gradually subject the quantum computation to increased levels of noise. The scheme is implemented in a one qubit circuit on an IBM-Q device. It is determined that this is an effective method for controlled addition of noise, and further, that using noisy results to perform extrapolation can lead to improvements in the final output, provided careful attention is paid to how the extrapolation is carried out. © 2020 IEEE.","IBM-Q; NISQ; noise mitigation","Extrapolation; Exact results; Expectation values; Noise mitigation; Quantum Computing; Qubit circuits; Reliable results; Quantum computers","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2020-04328)","This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada through its Undergraduate Student Research Award and Discovery programs (RGPIN-2020-04328).","","Muller H.A.; Byrd G.; Culhane C.; DeBenedictis E.; Humble T.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172818969-7","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Here, we present a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based electronic system with a distributed synchronous clock and trigger architecture. The system supports synchronous control of qubits with jitters of ∼5 ps. We implement a real-time digital signal processing system in the FPGA, enabling precise timing control, arbitrary waveform generation, in-phase and quadrature demodulation for qubit state discrimination, and the generation of real-time qubit-state-dependent trigger signals for feedback/feedforward control. The hardware and firmware low-latency design reduces the feedback/feedforward latency of the electronic system to 125 ns, significantly less than the decoherence times of the qubit.

Such machines are operated in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) model of computing. As NISQ machines exhibit high error-rates, only programs that require a few qubits can be executed reliably. Therefore, NISQ machines tend to underutilize its resources. In this paper, we propose to improve the throughput and utilization of NISQ machines by using multi-programming and enabling the NISQ machine to concurrently execute multiple workloads. Multi-programming a NISQ machine is non-trivial. This is because, a multi-programmed NISQ machine can have an adverse impact on the reliability of the individual workloads. To enable multi-programming in a robust manner, we propose three solutions. First, we develop methods to partition the qubits into multiple reliable regions using error information from machine calibration so that each program can have a fair allocation of reliable qubits. Second, we observe that when two programs are of unequal lengths, measurement operations can impact the reliability of the co-running program. To reduce this interference, we propose a Delayed Instruction Scheduling (DIS) policy that delays the start of the shorter program so that all the measurement operations can be performed at the end. Third,we develop an Adaptive Multi-Programming (AMP) design that monitors the reliability at runtime and reverts to single program mode if the reliability impact of multi-programming is greater than a prede?ned threshold. Our evaluations with IBMQ16 show that our proposals can improve resource utilization and throughput by up to 2x, while limiting the impact on reliability. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Multi-programming; NISQ; Quantum computer; Reliability","Computer architecture; Errors; Quantum computers; Qubits; Reliability; Error information; Fair allocation; Instruction scheduling; NISQ; Reliability impacts; Resource utilizations; Three solutions; Unequal length; Computer programming","Microsoft","We thank the anonymous reviewers for their feedback.

However, the crosstalk, unwanted interference between qubits on NISQ processors, may cause performance degradation when using multiprogramming. To address this challenge, we introduce palloq (parallel allocation of QCs), a novel compilation protocol. Palloq improves the performance of quantum multiprogramming on NISQ processors, while paying attention to 1) the combination of QCs chosen for parallel execution and 2) the assignment of program qubit variables to physical qubits, to reduce unwanted interference among the active set of QCs. We also propose a software-based crosstalk detection protocol using a new combination of randomized benchmarking methods. Our method successfully characterizes the suitability of hardware for multiprogramming with relatively low detection costs. We found a tradeoff between the success rate and execution time of the multiprogramming. Our results will be of value when device throughput becomes a significant bottleneck. Until service providers have enough quantum processors available to more than meet demand, this approach will be attractive to the service providers and users who want to optimize job management and throughput of the processor.  © 2020 IEEE.","Compiler; crosstalk; multiprogramming; noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ); quantum computing","Economic and social effects; Program compilers; Quantum computers; Throughput; Timing circuits; Cloud-computing; INDEX TERMS quantum computing; Multi-programming; NISQ; On-currents; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Qubit; Service provider; Crosstalk","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (JPMXS0118067285)","This work was supported by MEXT Quantum Leap Flagship Program under Grant JPMXS0118067285","Y.

The purpose of this research is the ability to use multiple quantum simulators and computers in order to achieve calculations made by a unified number of qubits. The design for this algorithm makes use of parallel and distributed programming. The key results are amplified amplitudes obtained for large quantum circuits that would otherwise be impossible to execute on a single quantum computer whose available number of qubits is exceeded by the one of such circuits. Thus the algorithm presented in the current paper has been designed and tested, showing favorable results. A 25 qubit circuit was used for the test cases. It was partitioned in multiple smaller circuits that were sent for execution from a laptop, directly to the quantum devices.

We evaluate the computational power of some existing quantum computers to illustrate the relevance of research in post-quantum security. One of the best ways to test post-quantum protocols is to embed them into some non-critical but widely-used sphere. Secure messaging is an excellent example of such an application. In the paper, we analyze the post-quantum security of well-known messaging specification Signal, which is considered to have high-security properties. The core of Signal specification is the Double Ratchet protocol. We notice and explain why it is not a post-quantum secure scheme.

A quantum computer comprises a cryogenic quantum processor and a classical electronic controller. When scaling up the cryogenic quantum processor to at least a few thousands, and possibly millions, of qubits required for any practical quantum algorithm, cryogenic CMOS (cryo-CMOS) electronics is required to allow feasible and compact interconnections between the controller and the quantum processor. Cryo-CMOS leverages the CMOS fabrication infrastructure while exploiting the continuous improvement of performance and miniaturization guaranteed by Moore's law, in order to enable the fabrication of a cost-effective practical quantum computer. However, designing cryo-CMOS integrated circuits requires a new set of CMOS device models, their embedding in design and verification tools, and the possibility to co-simulate the cryo-CMOS/quantum-processor architecture for full-system optimization. In this paper, we address these challenges by focusing on their impact on the design of complex cryo-CMOS systems. © 2017 ACM.","Cryo-CMOS; cryogenics; device models; error-correcting loop; quantum computation; qubit","CMOS integrated circuits; Computer aided design; Cryogenics; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Continuous improvements; Device models; Electronic controllers; Electronic controls; Error-correcting; qubit; Scalable quantum computing; System optimizations; Integrated circuit design","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","0738100X","978-145034927-7","PDAWD","","English","Proc Des Autom Conf","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023612634"

The procedure for developing a quantum computing system or algorithm involves the presence of interference, quantum entanglement, and superposition. In a classical computer, the amount of data is measured in bits, and in a quantum computer, in qubits. A qubit is a quantum discharge or the smallest element for storing information in a quantum computer, as well as a quantum object that can be in a superposition of two states, that is, encode both a logical unit and zero at the same time. The general structure of the universal quantum algorithm is implemented as diagrams that reveal the basic elements, their properties, functions and place in the work of the quantum algorithm. The input value for the quantum algorithm is a binary function. A detailed decomposition of each block of the schematic diagram for the description of sequential processes and stages of quantum algorithms has been performed. A quantum block that runs n times is necessary for the sequential use of quantum operators and the subsequent measurement of the result of the entire computing process. Due to the probabilistic nature of quantum computing, the obtained basis vectors will contain some of the information necessary to solve a particular computational problem. Classical and quantum types of errors and methods for their elimination are described and developed. The main obstacles to protecting the channel from noise are the inability to copy data and information, the continuity of error and the destruction of quantum information during measurement (according to the principles of quantum computing, measuring a set of qubits without destroying the information encoded there is impossible). The bit and phase types of errors were corrected by modeling quantum circuits, three-qubit coding, and a set of quantum gates. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Entanglement; Quantum gate; Quantum scheme; Qubit; Wave function","Coding errors; Mathematical operators; Qubits; Schematic diagrams; Computational problem; Data and information; General structures; Of quantum-information; Quantum algorithms; Quantum computing systems; Schematic representations; Sequential process; Quantum entanglement","Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ, (20-07-00368)","The reported study was funded by RFBR according to the research project № 20-07-00368.","V.

To achieve scalability beyond small prototypes, quantum architectures are expected to adopt a modular approach, featuring clusters of tightly connected quantum bits with sparser connections between these clusters. Efficiently distributing qubits across multiple processing cores is critical for improving quantum computing systems' performance and scalability. To address this challenge, we propose the Hungarian Qubit Assignment (HQA) algorithm, which leverages the Hungarian algorithm to improve qubit-to-core assignment. The HQA algorithm considers the interactions between qubits over the entire circuit, enabling fine-grained partitioning and enhanced qubit utilization.

Classical networks have well-established protocols for reliable end-to-end transmission that use duplicating the classical bits implicitly. However, due to the no-cloning theorem, quantum bits (qubits) cannot be copied. In this paper, we propose to use a Universal Quantum Copying Machine (UQCM) to create imperfect clones and summarizes the Quantum Automatic Repeat Request (QARQ) protocol, which is inspired by its classical counterpart. To investigate the viability of QARQ, a simulation platform is created considering Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center qubit platform that implements QARQ for quantum communication. The results explore the applications it is suitable for while maintaining enough quality of the qubit state. Two major quantum technologies are studied for these protocols: Direct Transmission (DT), and Teleportation (TP). It has been shown that for short distance communication DT provides better fidelity than TP while for long-distance communication TP outperforms DT and hence improves the QARQ performance as well.  © 2023 IEEE.","qubit retransmission; reliable quantum communication; universal quantum cloning machine","Clone cells; Cloning; Error correction; Information theory; Quantum cryptography; Qubits; Simulation platform; Automatic repeat request; Classical bits; Data-transmission; End-to-end transmission; Information- theoretic securities; Quantum bit retransmission; Quantum cloning machines; Reliable quantum communication; Retransmissions; Universal quantum cloning machine; Quantum communication","AEI IBON, (PID2020-114135RB-I00); H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (101092766, 813144); Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats, ICREA","The research leading to these results has received funding from the MSCA REAL-NET (G.A. 813144) HORIZON ALLEGRO (G.A. 101092766) and the AEI IBON (PID2020-114135RB-I00) projects and from the ICREA institution.","M.

However, these proposals do not account for crosstalk errors, which occur when active qubits interact during execution. The reason for this is that crosstalk only appears after the initial mapping, while previous strategies allocate qubits based on program and quantum system characteristics using one-step mapping methods. Scheduling-based solutions have been created to address this problem by inserting barriers between gates to reduce crosstalk, but at the expense of increased execution time and coherence error rates, ultimately decreasing overall accuracy. This paper presents and evaluates TRIM, a novel strategy that characterizes crosstalk and eliminates it in an iterative fashion using a multi-step greedy search method, which can be applied to any qubit mapping to reduce crosstalk while keeping execution time and coherence errors in check. Evaluations of TRIM using multiple workloads show PST improvements of 7.3% for single-programmed execution and 7.7% for multiprogramming scenarios, while reducing or keeping the number of gates, compared to a state-of-the-art mapping scheme. Additionally, TRIM achieves 5.4% and 3.3% PST improvements for single-programmed and multiprogrammed executions, respectively, compared to a state-of-the-art scheduling strategy. © 2023 IEEE.","Compiler; Mapping Techniques; NISQ; Quantum Computing; Reliability","Crosstalk; Errors; Iterative methods; Quantum optics; Compiler; Error rate; Gate errors; Logical qubits; Mapping techniques; NISQ; Physical qubits; Quantum Computing; Quantum system; State of the art; Mapping","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1763681, 1931531, 2028929, 2119236, 2122155)","The material presented in this paper is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Numbers 2119236, 2122155, 2028929, 1931531, and 1763681.","S.

A lownoise cryo-CMOS receiver at 3-4 ~K integrated tightly with the lowcryogenic quantum processor can relax or even potentially eliminated the need for the HEMT LNA, and keep the whole control loop at cryogenic temperature, hence avoiding any high-speed interconnects to room temperature (Fig. 1). Additionally, wide bandwidths in the receiver enables qubit-multiplexing, where qubits can be frequency multiplexed with a spacing of 10 MHz-40 MHz, allowing anywhere from 10's-100's of qubits to be packed in to a single readout line with gigahertz-scale bandwidths. A second critical metric is power consumption, since the cooling power available in a typical dilution refrigerator is limited to a few watts at 3-4 ~K. Therefore, the control and readout circuits should be designed with low power consumption, projected to be < 1 ~mW per qubit (Fig. 1). While there has been initial progress in the design of cryo-CMOS readout systems, a leap forward is required in their overall power consumption to be viable for future quantum systems. In this work, we showcase the design and implementation of the first sub-mWper-qubit cryo-CMOS RX - a wideband, I/Q-downconversion, 4 ~K receiver for qubit readout that achieves >1.9 GHz of IF bandwidth with >50 ~dB conversion gain and 0.7 ~dB NF while consuming only 17 ~mW of power consumption, thanks to various design techniques including near-threshold operation and low-1/f-noise passive mixers, representing 3-5 × lower power consumption than prior works [2]-[3] while achieving similar noise, BW and gain performance. In addition, we demonstrate a real-time qubit read-out measurement by integrating our cryogenic-CMOS receiver with a transmon qubit.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Bandwidth; CMOS integrated circuits; Cryogenics; Electric power utilization; Integrated circuit design; Low power electronics; Quantum optics; Qubits; Readout systems; Refrigerators; CMOS receivers; Computing applications; Control circuits; Low-power consumption; Lower noise; Lower-power consumption; Quanta computers; Qubit read-out; Read-out circuit; Scalable quantum computing; Low noise amplifiers","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","08865930","979-835039948-6","PCICE","","English","Proc Custom Integr Circuits Conf","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160010116"

The QFT is termed 'semi-classical' because measurements of individual qubits are taken during the algorithm, but in an way that extracts only partial information.

It is a parallel algorithm that uses a variant of the producer–consumer pattern. It was designed to easily accept and interchange different pruning techniques. The results obtained are occurrences of different query graphs in a RI human protein-to-protein interaction data graph (Ferro et al., [18], Szklarczyk et al., Nucleic Acids Res 39, 2011 [20]). This is the graph in which the algorithm will execute the search. The execution times are feasible for increasingly larger query graphs (from three up to twenty nodes) and with the included quantum computing approach were obtained superior results. The work consists of implementing and testing the algorithm in an original way starting from a simple multiprocessing example (Python multiprocessing producer consumer pattern, [28]) and then writing and adapting it for use with multiple consumer processes, undirected graphs and motif finding.

In particular, the fabrication of quantum processors is a key long-term goal that will allow us conducting specific tasks much more efficiently than the most powerful classical computers can do. Motivated by recent experiments in which three addressable spin qubits are defined on a potential single-molecule quantum processor, namely the [Gd(H2O)P5W30O110]12− polyoxometalate, we investigate the decohering effect of magnetic noise on the encoded quantum information. Our state-of-the-art model, which provides more accurate results than previous estimates, show a noticeable contribution of magnetic noise in limiting the survival timescale of the qubits. Yet, our results suggest that it might not be the only dephasing mechanism at play but other mechanisms, such as lattice vibrations and physical movement of magnetic nuclei, must be considered to understand the whole decoherence process. © Copyright © 2019 Escalera-Moreno and Baldoví.","coordination chemistry; decoherence; molecular magnetism; molecular nanomagnet; molecular spin qubits; polyoxometalate; quantum algorithm; scalability","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (751047); European Commission, EC, (647301); European Cooperation in Science and Technology, COST, (CA15128 MOLSPIN); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (CTQ2015-66223-C2-2-P, CTQ2017-89993); Generalitat Valenciana, GVA, (H2020-MSCA-IF-2016-751047); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (MAT2017-89528, MDM-2015-0538)","Funding.

A major challenge towards noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing is characterizing and reducing the various control costs. Quantum programming describes the process of quantum computation as a sequence, whose elements are selected from a finite set of universal quantum gates. Quantum compilation translates quantum programs to ordered pulses to the quantum control devices subsequently and quantum compilation optimization provides a high-level solution to reduce the control cost efficiently. Here, we propose a high-performance compilation strategy for multiplexing quantum control architecture.

The disentanglement is induced by off-resonant scattering of acoustical phonons in the semiconductor host. According to our results, a rather unusual recovery of entanglement occurs that depends on the geometrical configuration of the qubits. In addition, for large times a non-vanishing stationary entanglement is predicted. For the cases of one and two initial excitations, a simple kinetic interpretation allows for an adequate analysis of the observed dynamics.

However, a significant increase in the number of quantum bits (qubits) and their performance is required to demonstrate such quantum supremacy. While scaling up the underlying quantum processor is extremely challenging, building the electronics required to interface such large-scale processor is just as relevant and arduous. This paper discusses the challenges in designing a scalable electronic interface for quantum processors. To that end, we discuss the requirements dictated by different qubit technologies and present existing implementations of the electronic interface. The limitations in scaling up such state-of-the-art implementations are analyzed, and possible solutions to overcome those hurdles are reviewed. The benefits offered by operating the electronic interface at cryogenic temperatures in close proximity to the low-temperature qubits are discussed. Although several significant challenges must still be faced by researchers in the field of cryogenic control for quantum processors, a cryogenic electronic interface appears the viable solution to enable large-scale quantum computers able to address world-changing computational problems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CMOS; Cryo-CMOS; Cryogenics; Electronics; Quantum bit (qubit); Quantum computing","CMOS integrated circuits; Cryogenics; Electronic equipment; Quantum optics; Temperature; Computational problem; Cryogenic electronics; Cryogenic temperatures; Electronic interface; Large scale quantum computers; Quantum bit (qubit); Quantum Computing; Traditional computers; Qubits","Intel Corp.","The authors would like to thank Intel Corp. for funding this project.

An important direction of research has been to decompose an arbitrary entangled state, represented as a unitary, into a quantum circuit, that is, a sequence of gates supported by a quantum processor. It has been well known that circuits with longer decompositions and more entangling multi-qubit gates are error-prone for the current noisy, intermediate-scale quantum devices. To this end, there has been a significant interest to develop heuristic-based methods to discover compact circuits. We contribute to this effort by proposing QuantumCircuitOpt (QCOpt), a novel open-source framework which implements mathematical optimization formulations and algorithms for decomposing arbitrary unitary gates into a sequence of hardware-native gates. A core innovation of QCOpt is that it provides optimality guarantees on the quantum circuits that it produces. In particular, we show that QCOpt can find up to 57% reduction in the number of necessary gates on circuits with up to four qubits, and in run times less than a few minutes on commodity computing hardware. We also validate the efficacy of QCOpt as a tool for quantum circuit design in comparison with a naive brute-force enumeration algorithm. We also show how the QCOpt package can be adapted to various built-in types of native gate sets, based on different hardware platforms like those produced by IBM, Rigetti and Google. We hope this package will facilitate further algorithmic exploration for quantum processor designers, as well as quantum physicists.  © 2021 IEEE.","Discrete Optimization; Open-source Software; Quantum Circuit Design; Quantum Computing","Integrated circuit design; Integrated circuit manufacture; Open source software; Open systems; Optimization; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Timing circuits; Computing community; Discrete optimization; Non-trivial; Novel methods; Open source frameworks; Open-source softwares; Quantum circuit; Quantum circuit design; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; Heuristic methods","Information Science & Technology Institute; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD; Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL","This work was supported by the U.S. DOE through a quantum computing program sponsored by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Information Science & Technology Institute and the LANL’s Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program under projects “20190590ECR: Discrete Optimization Algorithms for Provably Optimal Quantum Circuit Design” and “20210114ER: Accelerating Combinatorial Optimization with Noisy Analog Hardware”.","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172818674-0","","","English","Proc.

CMOS operating at cryogenic temperatures down to 4 K (cryo-CMOS) allows for closer system integration, thus promising a scalable solution to enable future quantum computers. In this paper, a cryogenic control system is proposed, along with the required specifications, for the interface of the classical electronics with the quantum processor. To prove the advantages of such a system, the functionality of key circuit blocks is experimentally demonstrated. The characteristic properties of cryo-CMOS are exploited to design a noise-canceling low-noise amplifier for spin-qubit RF-reflectometry readout and a class-F2,3 digitally controlled oscillator required to manipulate the state of qubits. © 1966-2012 IEEE.","Class-F oscillator; CMOS characterization; cryo-CMOS; low-noise amplifier (LNA); noise canceling; phase noise (PN); quantum bit (qubit); quantum computing; qubit control; single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD)","Avalanche diodes; CMOS integrated circuits; Cryogenics; Particle beams; Phase noise; Power amplifiers; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Radio frequency amplifiers; Timing circuits; Class-f; Noise canceling; Quantum bit (qubit); Quantum Computing; Single photon avalanche diode; Low noise amplifiers","Intel Corporation; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (688539)","Manuscript received April 21, 2017; revised July 5, 2017; accepted July 28, 2017.

Given the rapid growth in the number of qubits in cutting-edge quantum processors, it is of interest to investigate the applicability of this control scheme to much larger-scale systems with realistic restrictions on connectivity.

One such paradigm shift is to design and engineer a new generation of algorithms and devices which exploit fundamental quantum mechanical properties such as quantum superposition and entanglement for both information processing and transmission. Entanglement offers the possibility of enormous speed up due to massively parallel operation. However, this requires new ways of thinking regarding the very nature of information processing in which measurement and read-out are intrinsic to successful quantum algorithms. For transmission of information, quantum superposition offers the possibility of communications whose absolute security is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. But how close are we to being able to translate this potential into practical machines? The technical challenges are formidable because these devices need to control and manipulate individual atoms, electrons or photons. Nevertheless impressive progress has been made over the past five years. The very simplest devices which involve only one or two active quantum bits (qubits) are already finding application in ultra-secure communications systems using quantum key distribution. This requires a single photon source (i.e. a source that produces one and only one photon per pulse) and we will review our progress in fabricating such sources based on advanced diamond technology. Scaling up to many qubit architectures is even more challenging, but highly sophisticated devices which operate at the single electron level have recently been demonstrated. These devices represent the basic building blocks for a quantum information processor which, when integrated, may from the basis of practical quantum computing machines. In this talk, I will attempt to show how recent progress provides a glimpse into one possible version of tomorrow's computing world.","","Algorithms; Binary sequences; Data communication systems; Parallel processing systems; Quantum theory; Moore's Law; Quantum algorithms; Quantum mechanical approaches; Quantum superposition; Data processing","","","","","","","1595932828; 978-159593282-2","","","English","Proc Int Conf Supercomputing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34547458081"

Physical systems that act as qubits encompass a wide range of technologies, from ions, to local defect states in crystals, and on to microelectronic devices addressable with wire interconnects. Materials issues arise in all of these, and this issue of MRS Bulletin describes how materials challenges and opportunities arise and have been used to make qubit-based quantum circuits using very different materials systems. In this overview article, we first review the universal ideas of how information is introduced and processed in a quantum computer. Comparing quantum to classical computers, for a given number of bits, the information content in a quantum computer is exponentially larger. But quantum computers face a daunting challenge: How do we keep the information from degrading and eventually disappearing? Maintaining the coherence of a quantum computer comes down to specific materials issues for all the approaches studied so far.

In the context of quantum information, universal refers to the ability to carry out arbitrary unitary transformations in the systems computational space. Combining arbitrary single-quantum-bit (qubit) gates with an entangling two-qubit gate provides a set of gates capable of achieving universal control of any number of qubits, provided that these gates can be carried out repeatedly and between arbitrary pairs of qubits. Although gate sets have been demonstrated in several technologies, they have so far been tailored towards specific tasks, forming a small subset of all unitary operators. Here we demonstrate a quantum processor that can be programmed with 15 classical inputs to realize arbitrary unitary transformations on two qubits, which are stored in trapped atomic ions. Using quantum state and process tomography, we characterize the fidelity of our implementation for 160 randomly chosen operations. This universal control is equivalent to simulating any pairwise interaction between spin-1/2 systems. A programmable multiqubit register could form a core component of a large-scale quantum processor, and the methods used here are suitable for such a device. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

But until now, it is unclear how precisely such high-performance computers will be constructed, even the fundamental functionality is in question. Thus, it is very hard to prepare today, from a programmer perspective, in-depth for the anticipated near-term programming paradigm shift due to quantum computers. Furthermore, the industry is reluctant to invest heavily into quantum software development right now, since under this uncertainty regarding the future development of hardware and Cloud services, no one would like to see all these efforts to be ruined by a novel technology, an unforeseen new machine, which would eradicate the software in place, which the industry had developed so costly. This calls for a more generic view on Hybrid Quantum Computing, on one hand hardware agnostic, but still anticipating the fundamental laws of nature which rule any future quantum computing system, regardless of its engineered excellence. This generalization can be done with the introduction of a Virtual Quantum Processor, a piece of imaginary hardware, which is described detailed enough, to emulate a generic hybrid quantum machine based on a set of instructions within a Turing machine. If this could be accomplished, we would retrieve a Uniform Computing Model for Hybrid Quantum Software, which can be applied later to any physical representation of quantum computing hardware, but would run already today on our current machines. © 2021 IEEE.","high-performance computing; hybrid; programming model; quantum; uniform; virtual processor","Computer hardware; Computer software; Software design; Turing machines; High-performance computing; Hybrid; Performance computing; Programming models; Quantum; Quantum Computing; Quantum computing models; Quantum processors; Uniform; Virtual processor; Quantum computers","","","G.

Accurate measurements of the flux states, especially in the time domain, require a controllable coupling between a qubit and a readout circuit (e.g., a dc SQUID magnetometer). Since the readout circuit can also be a source of decoherence, such a controllable coupling also allows one to control (minimize) the back action of the magnetometer. For this purpose we suggest a balanced, tunable transformer. This has a gradiometer configuration such that each arm is broken by a small loop containing two Josephson junctions. As a result the inductance of each arm can be adjusted by an applied bias flux. In the symmetrical case there is no coupling between the qubit and the magnetometer while a desired coupling can be achieved by changing the asymmetry of the arms. Similar transformers may be be useful for achieving controllable, lossless coupling that is required between qubits. Theoretical analysis of the noise back action of the transformer as well as preliminary experimental results are presented.","Flux transformer; Quantum computation; Qubit","Inductance; Josephson junction devices; Magnetometers; Quantum electronics; SQUIDs; Tuning; Flux transformers; Electric transformers","Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; Agricultural Research Development Agency, ARDA, (ARO DAAD19-99-1-0341)","Manuscript received August 6, 2002.

This is why we propose a protocol for distributed quantum computation applicable to small register devices, specifically for the distribution of controlled unitary gates, the key element in the construction of every quantum computation algorithm. We leverage quantum sharing of partial results to obtain a parallel processing scheme, allowing for the first time the quantum distribution of very large gates with thousands of inputs using only small register devices with tens of qubits.

In our basically new quantum error correction approach, the classical states are coded into the eigenvectors and unitary transformations. In this paper, we show that with our new algorithm it's possible to create redundancy-free quantum error correction.

The core of a quantum processor consists of quantum devices that are manipulated using classical electronic circuits, which need to be co-designed for optimal performance and operation. As the principles governing the behavior of the classical circuits and the quantum devices are different, this presents a unique challenge in terms of the simulation, design and optimization of the joint system. A methodology is presented to transform the behavior of small-scale quantum processors to equivalent circuit models that are usable with classical circuits in a generic electrical simulator, enabling the detailed analysis of the impact of many important non-idealities. The methodology has specifically been employed to derive a circuit model of a superconducting qubit interacting with the quantized electromagnetic field of a superconducting resonator. Based on this technique, a comprehensive analysis of the qubit operation is performed, including the coherent control and readout of the qubit using electrical signals. Furthermore, the effect of several non-idealities in the system such as qubit relaxation, decoherence and leakage out of the computational subspace are captured, in contrast to previous works. As the presented method enables the co-simulation of the control electronics with the quantum system, it facilitates the design and optimization of near-term superconducting quantum processors.  © 2021 EDAA.","co-simulation; control electronics; equivalent circuit models; non-idealities in quantum systems; Quantum computing; qubit control; qubit readout","Circuit simulation; Electromagnetic fields; Equivalent circuits; Integrated circuit design; Quantum theory; Superconducting resonators; Timing circuits; Comprehensive analysis; Control electronics; Design and optimization; Equivalent circuit model; Optimal performance; Quantum computing systems; Quantum processors; Superconducting qubits; Qubits","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15301591","978-398192635-4","","","English","Proc.

An alternative approach is to use atomic ensembles as quantum bits. However, when an atomic ensemble is excited, by a laser beam matched to a two-level transition (or a Raman transition) for example, it leads to a cascade of many states as more and more photons are absorbed [R.H. Dicke, Phys. Rev. 93 (1954) 99]. In order to make use of an ensemble as a qubit, it is necessary to disrupt this cascade, and restrict the excitation to the absorption (and emission) of a single photon only. Here, we show how this can be achieved by using a new type of blockade mechanism, based on the light-shift imbalance (LSI) in a Raman transition. We describe first a simple example illustrating the concept of light-shift imbalance induced blockade (LSIIB) using a multi-level structure in a single atom, and show verifications of the analytic prediction using numerical simulations. We then extend this model to show how a blockade can be realized by using LSI in the excitation of an ensemble. Specifically, we show how the LSIIB process enables one to treat the ensemble as a two-level atom that undergoes fully deterministic Rabi oscillations between two collective quantum states, while suppressing excitations of higher order collective states. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Applications of GTQSM are presented for quantum information/computation processing circuits ranging from a simple qubit and superposition or product of two qubits through controlled NOT and Hadamard gate operations to a substantive case of 3-port, 5-stage circuit for quantum teleportation. An illustrative circuit for teleporting a qubit is modelled as a complex system of systems resulting in four probable transfer function models. It has the potential of extending the applications of GTQSM further to systems at the higher end of complexity scale too. The key contribution of this paper lies in generalization or extension of the graph-theoretic system modelling framework, hitherto used for classical (mostly deterministic) systems, to quantum random systems. Further extension of the graph-theoretic system modelling framework to quantum field modelling is the subject of future work. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","graph-theoretic modelling; quantum computing; quantum information processing; quantum system models","Computational linguistics; Flow rate; Graph theory; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Basic building block; Controlled NOT; Fundamental units; Graph-theoretic; Hadamard gate; Orthonormal basis; Processing circuits; Quantum bits; Quantum Computing; Quantum field; Quantum Information; Quantum system; Quantum teleportation; Quantum-information processing; Random systems; System modelling; Transfer function model; Von Neumann entropy; Quantum optics","","","V.

With many different potential hardware implementations, quantum computer architecture is a rich field with an opportunity to solve interesting new problems and to revisit old ones. This paper presents a QC architecture tailored to physical implementations with highly mobile and persistent quantum bits (qubits). Implementations with qubit coherency times that are much longer than operation times and qubit transportation times that are orders of magnitude faster than operation times lend greater flexibility to the architecture. This is particularly true in the placement and locality of individual qubits. For concreteness, we assume a physical device model based on electron-spin qubits on liquid helium (eSHe). Like many conventional computer architectures, QCs focus on the efficient exposure of parallelism.We present here a QC microarchitecture that enjoys increasing computational parallelism with size and latency scaling only linearly with the number of operations. Although an efficient and high level of parallelism is admirable, quantum hardware is still expensive and difficult to build, so we demonstrate how the software may be optimized to reduce an application's hardware requirements by 25% with no performance loss. Because the majority of a QC's time and resources are devoted to quantum error correction, we also present noise modeling results that evaluate error correction procedures. These results demonstrate that idle qubits in memory need only be refreshedapproximately once every one hundred operation cycles.

While the first attempts on construction were succesful, scalability has never been achieved, due to the inherent fragile nature of the quantum bits (qubits). From the multitude of approaches to achieve scalability topological quantum computing (TQC) is the most promising one, by being based on an flexible approach to error-correction and making use of the straightforward measurement-based computing technique. TQC circuits are defined within a large, uniform, 3-dimensional lattice of physical qubits produced by the hardware and the physical volume of this lattice directly relates to the resources required for computation. Circuit optimization may result in non-intuitive mismatches between circuit specification and implementation. In this paper we introduce the first method for cross-level validation of TQC circuits. The specification of the circuit is expressed based on the stabilizer formalism, and the stabilizer table is checked by mapping the topology on the physical qubit level, followed by quantum circuit simulation. Simulation results show that cross-level validation of error-corrected circuits is feasible. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","quantum computing; topological quantum computing; validation","Logic circuits; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Scalability; Specifications; Topology; Circuit optimization; Circuit specifications; Computational problem; Computing techniques; Measurement-based; Quantum Computing; Stabilizer formalism; validation; Circuit simulation","","","","","Springer Verlag","03029743","978-331908493-0","","","English","Lect.

Such attention has resulted in a wide range of techniques being developed in solving more complex tasks at ever increasing speeds. At the same time, however, the complexity of such tasks has increased as such systems have to cope with ever increasing business requirements, rendering the above mentioned techniques unreliable, if not obsolete. Quantum computing is an alternative form of computation that holds a lot of potential for providing some advantages over classical computing for solving certain kinds of difficult optimization problems in the coming years. Motivated by this fact, in this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of running a particular type of optimization problem on existing quantum computing technology. The optimization problem investigate arises when considering how to optimize a robotic assembly line, which is one of the keys to success in the manufacturing domain. A small improvement in the efficiency of such an MRS can lead to huge saving in terms of time of manufacturing, capacity, robot life, and material usage. The nature of the quantum processor used in this study imposes the constraint that the optimization problem be cast as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. For the specific problem we investigate, this allows situations with one robot to be modeled naturally, meanwhile modeling the multi-robot generalization is less obvious and left as a topic for future research. The results show that for simple 1-robot tasks, the optimization problem can be straightforwardly solved within a feasible time span on existing quantum computing hardware. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","D-Wave; MRS; Optimization problem; Quantum annealing; QUBO; Robotic manufacturing; TSP","Industrial robots; Manufacture; Optimization; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Robot programming; Robotics; Business requirement; Manufacturing domains; Multiple robot system; Optimization problems; Planning and scheduling; Quantum annealing; QUBO; Robotic assembly lines; Robotic assembly","","","A.

Current state-of-the-art experiments rarely go beyond 10 qubits and in most cases demonstrate only limited control. Here we demonstrate control of a 12-qubit system, and show that the system can be employed as a quantum processor to optimize its own control sequence by using measurement-based feedback control (MQFC). The final product is a control sequence for a complex 12-qubit task: preparation of a 12-coherent state. The control sequence is about 10% more accurate than the one generated by the standard (classical) technique, showing that MQFC can correct for unknown imperfections. Apart from demonstrating a high level of control over a relatively large system, our results show that even at the 12-qubit level, a quantum processor can be a useful lab instrument. As an extension of our work, we propose a method for combining the MQFC technique with a twirling protocol, to optimize the control sequence that produces a desired Clifford gate. © The Author(s) 2017.","","Quantum optics; Control sequences; Efficient control; Lab instruments; Measurement-based; Quantum control; Quantum processors; Quantum-information processing; State of the art; Qubits","Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, CIFAR; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11175094, 91221205)","We thank Anthony P.

In this the emphasis is on the loopholes present in this algorithm which makes it less effective. In the next phase the focus is made on the C-QUBITS algorithm, which can be used for the exchange of key between the sender and the receiver. Thereafter, the key is used for the encryption of the data to be transferred between the two entities. This algorithm makes use of the concepts of quantum physics like polarization and more importantly C-NOT gate which is mainly used in case of qubits (quantum bits).

Although quantum computing is still in its infancy, experiments have been carried out and proto-types have been developed, showing promising results for future commercial applications [3] [4] [5] [6]. Research in both theoretical and practical areas continues at a frantic pace, and many national governments, research institutions and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum computers for both civilian and national security purposes, such as cryptanalysis, genetics, drugs and disease research, materials science and design and so on [2]. Thanks to its computing power, the usage of quantum computing capabilities in orbit would bring priceless benefits to space and enable novel methodologies and technologies to improve both on ground and in space applications. On-board cyber-security, satellite AI, advanced autonomous life support systems for human exploration are only few of the domains which could be dramatically boosted by the availability of this technology. The paper discusses an early study about an experimentation of a quantum computer in orbit as a first step for a future fully qualified flight-ready payload. It discusses the major benefits of a flight experimentation, focusing on the one hand on the objectives and the expected benefits that it will bring to the development of the space borne and on-ground technology, on the other hand on the open questions like the effect of microgravity on the architecture of this technology. It analyses the currently available implementation solutions of quantum computers on ground which are currently prototyped (e.g. IBM Q System One), and provides early results on the identified main technical aspects to be considered to improve the technology readiness level. It highlights the most important challenges to be considered in the design and the added value that the space environment will bring as scientific feedback. Finally, it describes possible scenarios and mission profiles analysed and identified as potential hosting platform candidates, focusing on pros and cons of each of them.

The complexity of an experimental setup increases rapidly as the number of qubits grows. Cumbersome instrument management, distortion of signals, and inefficiency of data transmission are gradually highlighted and become the bottlenecks in scaling up the number of qubits. In addition, fault-tolerant quantum computing has real-time feedback requirements of qubit states. To deal with these challenges, we propose an instrument management software design in this paper. The software maps the resources of separate instruments to a unified virtual instrument, achieving the scalability of the instruments. The processing and correction of signals are deployed on a server, which automatically corrects the distortion of the signals. By designing a multi-threaded mechanism for the AWG and a custom-defined data-link protocol for the digitizer, the efficiency of the software meets the requirements of experiments. Cooperating with the AWG and digitizer, the software provides the real-time feedback capability using an instruction compiler. Thus, the software meets the requirements of superconducting quantum computing, as demonstrated through its application to a 12-bit quantum experiment. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Arbitrary waveform generator (AWG); digitizer; quantum computing; software","Application programs; Computer software; Feedback; Quantum optics; Qubits; Waveform analysis; Arbitrary waveform generator; Data link protocols; Digitizers; Fault-tolerant quantum computing; Management software; Quantum Computing; Real-time feedback; Virtual instrument; Software design","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","00189499","","IETNA","","English","IEEE Trans Nucl Sci","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069514241"

Multicore architectures are a firm candidate for unlocking the scalability of quantum processors. Nonetheless, the vulnerability and complexity of quantum communications make this a challenging approach. A comprehensive design should imply consolidating the communications stack in the quantum computer architecture.

One way to address this challenge is to assemble small, specialized quantum processors into a larger computing system, named distributed quantum computing. In this work, we focus on a key problem in distributed quantum computing: how to map logical qubits of a specific quantum circuit to different processors in a heterogeneous quantum network with the goal of minimizing the overall communication overhead. To solve this problem, we formulate a probability-aware qubit-to-processor mapping model, where the communication overhead between each pair of processors is determined through probabilistic analyses based on the link entanglement generation rates. We also introduce a multi-flow routing protocol in our model to improve the overall entanglement rates. Afterward, we employ a multistage hybrid simulated annealing algorithm to minimize the total communication overhead. Lastly, we perform extensive simulations to show the superiority of our solutions under a wide range of system settings.  © 2023 ACM.","","Distributed computer systems; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Simulated annealing; 'current; Communication overheads; Distributed quantum computing; Large computing systems; Logical qubits; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum network; Quantum processors; Single processors; Mapping","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS-2231040)","This research work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant number CNS-2231040.","Y.

The problem of distinguishing state preparation errors from measurement errors is important to the field of characterizing quantum processors. In this work, we propose a method to separately characterize state preparation and measurement errors using a different type of algorithmic cooling protocol called measurement-based algorithmic cooling (MBAC). MBAC assumes the ability to perform (potentially imperfect) projective measurements on individual qubits, which is available on many modern quantum processors. We demonstrate that MBAC can significantly reduce state preparation error under realistic assumptions, with a small overhead that can be upper bounded by measurable quantities. Thus, MBAC can be a valuable tool not only for benchmarking near-term quantum processors but also for improving the performance of quantum processors in an algorithmic manner. © 2022 American Physical Society.","","Benchmarking; Measurement errors; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Algorithmics; Measurement-based; Performance; Projective measurement; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; State measurements; State preparation; Cooling","Mike and Ophelia Lazaridis; Schwartz/Reisman Foundation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Ministry of Defense, MOD","R.L. acknowledges funding from Mike and Ophelia Lazaridis.

In order to realize a universal quantum computer with trapped ions, independent and parallel control over the state of each qubit is necessary. The manipulation of individual qubit states in an ion chain via stimulated Raman transitions generally requires light focused on individual ions. In this manuscript, we present a novel, guided-light individual addressing system for hyperfine Ba+ qubits. The system takes advantage of laser-written waveguide technology, enabled by the atomic structure of Ba+, allowing the use of visible light to drive Raman transitions. Such waveguides define the spatial mode of light, suppressing aberrations that would have otherwise accumulated in a free-space optics set up. As a result, we demonstrate a nearest neighbor relative intensity crosstalk on the order of 10−4, without any active aberration compensation. This is comparable to or better than other previous demonstrations of individual addressing. At the same time, our modular approach provides independent and agile control over the amplitude, frequency, and phase of each channel; combining the strengths of previous implementations. © 2023 The Author(s).

Specifically, it is envisaged that near-term quantum computers will have low qubit connectivity: each qubit will only be able to interact with a subset of the other qubits, a reality typically represented by a qubit interaction graph in which a vertex represents a qubit and an edge represents a possible direct 2-qubit interaction (gate). Thus the depth overhead is unavoidably incurred by introducing swap gates into the quantum circuit to enable general qubit interactions. This paper proves that there exist quantum circuits where a depth overhead in Ω(log n) must necessarily be incurred when running quantum circuits with n qubits on quantum computers whose qubit interaction graph has finite degree, but that such a logarithmic depth overhead is achievable. The latter is shown by the construction of a 4-regular qubit interaction graph and associated compilation algorithm that can execute any quantum circuit with only a logarithmic depth overhead. © Rinton Press.","Depth overhead; NISQs; Quantum compilers; Qubit routing","Computer circuits; Graph algorithms; Quantum theory; Compilation algorithms; Finite degree; Interaction graphs; N qubits; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; SWAP gate; Qubits","Networked Quantum Information Technologies Hub Industrial","This work was supported by an Networked Quantum Information Technologies Hub Industrial Partnership Project Grant, and thanks are also given to Sathyawageeswar Subramanian who proof-read an early version of the paper, and made several useful suggestions concerning the rigour and clarity of the paper.

Superconducting qubits may offer an attractive route towards scalable quantum computing. In previous experiments on coupled superconducting qubits, conditional gate behaviour and entanglement were demonstrated. Here we demonstrate selective execution of the complete set of four different controlled-NOT (CNOT) quantum logic gates, by applying microwave pulses of appropriate frequency to a single pair of coupled flux qubits. All two-qubit computational basis states and their superpositions are used as input, while two independent single-shot SQUID detectors measure the output state, including qubit-qubit correlations. We determined the gate's truth table by directly measuring the state transfer amplitudes and by acquiring the relevant quantum phase shift using a Ramsey-like interference experiment. The four conditional gates result from the symmetry of the qubits in the pair: either qubit can assume the role of control or target, and the gate action can be conditioned on either the 0-state or the 1-state. These gates are now sufficiently characterized to be used in quantum algorithms, and together form an efficient set of versatile building blocks. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.","","quantum dot; algorithm; experimental study; quantum mechanics; superconductivity; algorithm; article; correlation analysis; electric conductivity; priority journal; quantum mechanics; superconductor","Dutch National Initiative on Nano Science and Technology; Dutch organization for Fundamental Research on Matter; EuroSQIP; European Commission, EC; Stichting voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek der Materie, FOM","Acknowledgements We thank L.

Superconducting qubit technology, in particular, has emerged as a leading candidate for realizing a scalable quantum computing platform ready for paving the way to commercial quantum advantage. However, current academic approaches in fabrication and testing of quantum devices are not scalable and have already started to limit the rapid development of the field. Novel solutions are required to tackle the combined challenge of increasing the qubit count on a quantum processor and the need to further reduce the qubit’s error rates. This, in turn, will lead to a renewed acceleration in qubit manufacturing, test and diagnostics. Here we present aspects of how to move superconducting qubit manufacturing and testing from small-scale laboratory to large-scale fabrication facility environments. To enable this transfer, two key ingredients are demonstrated: (i) A foundry-compatible fabrication process of superconducting qubits that can benefit from the advanced process control in industry-scale CMOS fabrication facilities, and (ii) an acceleration of testing and cryogenic measurement throughput by using a milli-Kelvin cryo-CMOS signal multiplexer operating in near proximity to quantum devices and integrated qubit diagnostic and benchmarking tools with end-to-end data analytics. Although some of these elements have been explored independently, co-development is crucial to enable an efficient scalable development cycle for quantum computing technology. A full development cycle consisting of scalable manufacturing, testing, and benchmarking will enable the large-scale fabrication and control of quantum computing devices and thus pave the way to commercial quantum advantage. © 2023 SPIE.","Inspection; Metrology; Quantum Computer; Quantum Device Manufacturing; Superconducting Qubit Diagnostics","CMOS integrated circuits; Fabrication; Process control; Qubits; Supercomputers; Computational ecosystems; Development cycle; Large-scale fabrication; Quanta computers; Quantum device; Quantum device manufacturing; Quantum processors; Scalable quantum computing; Superconducting qubit diagnostic; Superconducting qubits; Benchmarking","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership, ECSEL, (101007322)","Results presented in this conference proceedings paper were in part obtained in a project that has received funding from the ECSEL Joint Undertaking (JU) under grant agreement No 101007322.

Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm could theoretically answer the computational problem in polynomial time. This paper contributes to the experiment and demonstration of Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm for RSA prime factorization using IBM Qiskit. The performance of the quantum program is evaluated based on user time and the success probability. The results show that a more significant public modulus N in the RSA public key improves factorization’s computational hardness, requiring more quantum bits to solve.

Fortunately, these algorithms also tend to contain a small number of repetitively-used quantum kernels. Identifying the quantum logic blocks that implement such quantum kernels is critical to the complexity management for realizing the corresponding quantum circuit. Moreover, quantum computation requires some type of quantum error correction coding to combat decoherence, which in turn results in a large number of ancilla qubits in the circuit. Sharing the ancilla qubits among quantum operations (even though this sharing can increase the overall circuit latency) is important in order to curb the resource demand of the quantum algorithm. This paper presents a multi-core reconfigurable quantum processor architecture, called Requp, which supports a layered approach to mapping a quantum algorithm and ancilla sharing. More precisely, a scalable quantum mapper, called Squash, is introduced, which divides a given quantum circuit into a number of quantum kernels - each kernel comprises k parts such that each part will run on exactly one of k available cores.

The feed-forward applies a conditional unitary operation, which changes the incorrect output states of the data qubit to the correct ones. The gate itself rotates an arbitrary quantum state of the data qubit around the z axis of the Bloch sphere with the angle of rotation being fully determined by the state of the program qubit. The gate implementation is based on fiber optics components. Qubits are encoded into spatial modes of single photons. The signal from the feed-forward detector is led directly to a phase modulator using only a passive voltage divider. We have verified the increase of the probability of success and characterized the gate operation by means of quantum process tomography. We have demonstrated that the use of feed-forward affects neither the process fidelity nor the output-state fidelities. © 2012 American Physical Society.","","Light; Multiphoton processes; Phase modulation; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Spheres; Voltage dividers; Angle of rotation; Arbitrary quantum state; Bloch sphere; Data qubit; Fast electronics; Feed-Forward; Fiber optics components; Gate operation; Linear optical; Passive voltage; Phase gates; Phase modulator; Probability of success; Quantum gates; Quantum process tomography; Single photons; Spatial modes; Theoretical limits; Unitary operation; Quantum computers","","","","","","10941622","","PLRAA","","English","Phys Rev A","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84855484990"

Research has been done on compilers to rewrite quantum programs to match hardware constraints. However, the quantum processor architecture, in particular the qubit connectivity and topology, still lacks enough discussion, while it potentially has a huge impact on the performance of the quantum algorithms. We perform a quantitative and comprehensive study on the quantum processor performance under different qubit connectivity and topology. We select ten representative design models with different connectivities and topologies from quantum architecture design space and benchmark their performance by running a set of standard quantum algorithms. It is shown that a high-performance architecture almost always comes with a design with large connectivity, while the topology shows a weak influence on the performance in our experiment. Different quantum algorithms show different dependence on quantum chip connectivity and topologies.

This stochastic master equation describes the random evolution of the measured SCB qubit density matrix and is conditioned on a particular realization of the measured electron tunneling events through the SET junctions. Hence it can be regarded as a Monte Carlo method (or a quantum trajectory approach) that allows us to simulate the continuous quantum measurement process.

Relatively small numbers of logical quantum bits or qubits could outperform the largest of supercomputers. Quantum dots in Si-based heterostructures and superconducting Josephson junctions are just two of the many approaches to construct the qubit. These, in particular, bear similarities to the transistors and interconnects used in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. While initial results on few-qubit systems are promising, advanced process control is expected to improve the qubit uniformity, coherence time, and gate fidelity needed for larger systems. This can be realized through the systematic characterization of film growth, interface control, and patterning. © 2016 IEEE.","","Electron devices; Film growth; Intelligent control; Interfaces (materials); Manufacture; Quantum optics; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor quantum dots; Supercomputers; Advanced Process Control; Classical computing; Coherence time; Gate fidelity; Interface control; Quantum Computing; SELECT algorithms; Semiconductor manufacturing; Quantum computers","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","01631918","978-150903901-2","TDIMD","","English","Tech.

Development of a quantum computer that has properties of strong Turing machine is a start of the new paradigm. It can make cryptography very secure; radically increase storage capacity; solve problems of artificial intelligence, provide very high processing power, etc. Although quantum computers can be simulated on a classical one, there is no efficient way in doing so. It is interesting to find out what can make a quantum computer more powerful than classical one. The answer lies in how much information a quantum bit (qubit) can store. This paper provides an introduction to the interesting world of quantum systems and main techniques of quantum computing. The paper starts with a brief historical overview and shows the advantages of developing a quantum computer. It explains the basics of quantum mechanics, qubits, and quantum computers and shows what kind of problems can be solved efficiently on quantum computers. It then continues with the different approaches currently known for developing a quantum computer, key problems, difficulties and latest discoveries - describing teleportation, quantum entanglement, parallelism and basic algorithms. Quantum cryptography and the possible key management algorithms will be discussed. In the end I will show and analyse the results and different approaches of latest achievements. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Real quantum devices that support these non-unitary operations enable us to execute a new class of quantum circuits, known as Dynamic Quantum Circuits (DQC). This helps to enhance the scalability, thereby allowing execution of quantum circuits comprising of many qubits by using at least two qubits. Recently DQC realizations of multi-qubit Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) and Bernstein-Vazirani (BV) algorithms have been demonstrated in two separate experiments. However the dynamic transformation of complex quantum circuits consisting of Toffoli gate operations have not been explored yet. This motivates us to: (a) explore the dynamic realization of Toffoli gates by extending the design space of DQC for Toffoli networks, and (b) propose a general dynamic transformation algorithm for the first time to the best of our knowledge. More precisely, we introduce two dynamic transformation schemes (dynamic-1 and dynamic-2) for Toffoli gates, that differ with respect to the required number of classically controlled gate operations. For evaluation, we consider the Deutsch-Jozsa (DJ) algorithm composed of one or more Toffoli gates. Experimental results demonstrate that dynamic DJ circuits based on dynamic-2 Toffoli realization scheme provides better computational accuracy over the dynamic-1 scheme. Further, the proposed dynamic transformation scheme is generic and can also be applied to non-Toffoli quantum circuits, e.g. BV algorithm. © 2023 EDAA.","Dynamic quantum circuit; mid-circuit measurement; quantum algorithms","Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Design spaces; Dynamic quantum circuit; Dynamic transformation; Gate operation; Mid-circuit measurement; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Toffoli gates; Transformation scheme; Unitary operation; Qubits","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15301591","978-398192637-8","","","English","Proc.

Existing quantum hardware cannot well support the control flow, significantly limiting the range of quantum software executable on the hardware. By analyzing the constraints in the control microarchitecture, we found that existing quantum assembly languages are either too high-level or too restricted to support comprehensive flow control on the hardware. Also, as observed with the quantum microinstruction set QuMIS [1], the quantum instruction set architecture (QISA) design may suffer from limited scalability and flexibility because of microarchitectural constraints. It is an open challenge to design a scalable and flexible QISA which provides a comprehensive abstraction of the quantum hardware. In this paper, we propose an executable QISA, called eQASM, that can be translated from quantum assembly language (QASM), supports comprehensive quantum program flow control, and is executed on a quantum control microarchitecture. With efficient timing specification, single-operationmultiple-qubit execution, and a very-long-instruction-word architecture, eQASM presents better scalability than QuMIS. The definition of eQASM focuses on the assembly level to be expressive. Quantum operations are configured at compile time instead of being defined at QISA design time. We instantiate eQASM into a 32-bit instruction set targeting a seven-qubit superconducting quantum processor. We validate our design by performing several experiments on a two-qubit quantum processor. © 2019 IEEE.","EQASM; Quantum control microarchitecture; Quantum instruction set architecture (QISA); QuMA; Superconducting quantum processor","Computer hardware; Control theory; Flow control; High level languages; Integrated circuit design; Quantum theory; Qubits; Scalability; Supercomputers; EQASM; Instruction set architecture; Micro architectures; Quantum processors; QuMA; Very long instruction word architecture","U.S. Army Research Office, (W911NF-16-1-0071); Intel Corporation; Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ODNI; Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, IARPA; European Research Council, ERC; China Scholarship Council, CSC","ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank C.

We test the publicly available IBM quantum computers using Grover's algorithm, a well-known quantum search algorithm, to obtain a baseline for the general evaluations of these quantum devices and to investigate the impacts of various factors such as number of quantum bits (or qubits), qubit choice, and device choice. The main contributions of this paper include a new 4-qubit implementation of Grover's algorithm and test results showing the current capabilities of quantum computers.

We present Incremental Pulse Reseeding, a practical scheme to guide optimal control software to the lowest-duration pulse by iteratively seeding the optimizer with previous results. We find a near-linear relationship between Hilbert space dimension and gate duration through explicit pulse optimization for one- and two-qudit gates on transmons.

In spite of the severe restriction, the model can solve several problems (such as calculating Jones polynomials) whose classical efficient solutions are not known. Furthermore, it was shown that if the output probability distribution of the one-clean-qubit model can be classically efficiently sampled with a constant multiplicative error, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the second level. Is it possible to improve the multiplicative error hardness result to a constant total variation distance error one like other subuniversal quantum computing models such as the IQP (Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial time) model, the boson sampling model, and the Fourier sampling model? In this paper we show that it is indeed possible if we accept a modified version of the average case hardness conjecture. Interestingly, the anticoncentration lemma can be easily shown by using the special property of the one-clean-qubit model that each output probability is so small that no concentration occurs. © 2017 American Physical Society.","","Errors; Hardness; Polynomial approximation; Polynomials; Probability distributions; Quantum optics; Sampling; Average-case hardness; Multiplicative errors; NO concentration; Polynomial hierarchies; Quantum Computing; Quantum computing models; Restricted models; Special properties; Quantum computers","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (17K12637, 26730003); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Monbusho; Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (15H00850, JPMJPR16UP)","T.M. was supported by JST ACT-I No. JPMJPR16UP, the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas No. 15H00850 of MEXT Japan, and the JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) No. 26730003 and No. 17K12637.","T.

Unfortunately, these devices are restricted by the number of on-chip qubits, capping processing power and slowing progress toward fault-tolerance. Although emerging transmon devices feature over 100 qubits, building QCs large enough for meaningful demonstrations of quantum advantage requires overcoming many design challenges. For example, today's transmon qubits suffer from significant variation due to limited precision in fabrication. As a result, barring significant improvements in current fabrication techniques, scaling QCs by building ever larger individual chips with more qubits is hampered by device variation. Severe device variation that degrades QC performance is referred to as a defect. Here, we focus on a specific defect known as a frequency collision. When transmon frequencies collide, their difference falls within a range that limits two-qubit gate fidelity. Frequency collisions occur with greater probability on larger QCs, causing collision-free yields to decline as the number of on-chip qubits increases. As a solution, we propose exploiting the higher yields associated with smaller QCs by integrating quantum chiplets within quantum multi-chip modules (MCMs). Yield, gate performance, and application-based analysis show the feasibility of QC scaling through modularity. Our results demonstrate that chiplet architectures, relative to monolithic designs, benefit from average yield improvements ranging from 9.6 - 92.6 × for ≲5 qubit machines. In addition, our simulations explore the design space of chiplet systems and discover configurations that demonstrate average two-qubit gate infidelity reductions that are at best 0.815 × their monolithic counterpart. Finally, we observe that carefully-selected modular systems achieve fidelity improvements on a range of benchmark circuits.  © 2022 IEEE.","quantum architecture; Quantum computing; superconducting quantum computers","Defects; Fault tolerance; Logic gates; Device variations; Frequency collision; Gate fidelity; On chips; Quanta computers; Quantum architecture; Quantum Computing; Scalings; Superconducting quantum computer; Two-qubit gates; Qubits","NSF Quantum Leap Challenge Institute for Hybrid Quantum Architectures and Networks, (2016136); National Quantum Information Science Research Centers; STAQ, (2110860, NSF Phy-1818914); US Department of Energy Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research; National Science Foundation, NSF, (2030859); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Office of Science, SC, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); University of Chicago","The authors would like to thank Malcolm Carroll, Nathan Earnest, Nikos Hardavellas, Jared Hertzberg, Ali Javadi-Abhari, and Jason Orcutt for their helpful discussions and comments during the preparation of this manuscript.

Current research mainly focuses on operations between two quantum states. However, various applications, such as integer factorization, optimization, and financial risk analysis, commonly require one of the inputs to be classical. It requires many ancillary qubits, especially when subsequent computations are involved. In this paper, we propose a quantum-classical comparator based on the quantum Fourier transform. Then we extend it to compare two quantum integers and modular arithmetic. Proposed operators only require up to one ancilla qubit, which is optimal for qubit resources. We analyze limitations in the current modular addition circuit and develop it to process arbitrary quantum states in the entire n-qubit space. The proposed algorithms reduce computing resources and make them valuable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. © 2023 The Author(s).

In this work, we present a crosstalk modeling analysis framework for near-Term quantum computers after extracting the error-rates experimentally. Our analysis reveals that crosstalk can be of the same order of gate error which is considered a dominant error in NISQ devices. We also propose adversarial fault injection using crosstalk in a multiprogramming environment where the victim and the adversary share the same quantum hardware. Our simulation and experimental results from IBM quantum computers demonstrated that the adversary can inject fault and launch a Denial-of-Service attack.

Qubits, the basic unit of quantum computing have the power to exist in more than one state at a time. While the classical computers only perform operations by manipulation of classical bits having two values 0 and 1, quantum bits can represent data in multiple states. This property of inheriting multiple states at a time is called superposition which gives quantum computers tremendous power over classical computers. With this power, the algorithms designed on quantum computers to solve search queries can yield result significantly faster than the classical algorithms. There are four types of problems that exist: Polynomial (P), Non-Deterministic Polynomial (NP), Non-Deterministic Polynomial Complete (NP-complete) and Non-Deterministic Polynomial hard (NP-hard). P problems can be solved in the polynomial amount of time like searching a database for an item. However, when the size of the search space grows, it becomes difficult to compute solutions even for P problems. Quantum algorithms like Grover’s algorithm has reduced the time complexity of some of the classical algorithm problems from N to N. Variants of Grover’s algorithm like Quantum Partial Search propose changes that yield not exact but closer results in time even lesser than Grover’s algorithm. NP problems are the problems whose solution if known can be verified in polynomial amount time. Factorization of prime numbers which is considered to be an NP problem took an exponential amount of time when solved using the classical computer while the Shor’s quantum computing algorithm computes it in polynomial time. Factorization is also a class of bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP) problems which are decision problems solved by quantum computers in polynomial time. There are problems to which if a solution is found can solve every problem Of NP class, these are NP-complete problems. The power of Qubits could be exploited in the future to come up with solutions for NP-complete problems in the future. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Grover’s algorithms; Quantum computing; Qubit; Search algorithms; Shor’s algorithm; Superposition","Computational complexity; Factorization; Learning algorithms; Polynomial approximation; Quantum optics; Quantum Computing; Qubit; S-algorithms; Search Algorithms; Superposition; Qubits","","","A.

However, due to the increasing demand for data processing and fast computing, the idea of enhancing machine learning with quantum computing has been proposed, known as quantum machine learning (QML). Quantum machine learning has the advantages of higher efficiency and accuracy. Quantum computing uses quantum bits (qubits) for data storage and computing, where a qubit can represent quantum states |0and |1simultaneously, enabling the processing of information for two states simultaneously, which is unparalleled in classical computing. Moreover, quantum machine learning can handle more complex data and process data faster. In classical machine learning, the processing of large-scale data and complex problems often faces problems of high computational complexity and low algorithm efficiency. Quantum computing can handle multiple computing tasks simultaneously, achieving faster computing. Therefore, in some scenarios that require efficient computing, quantum machine learning may be the best choice. In this study, we simulated quantum circuits using Qiskit and built a hybrid quantum-classical neural network model using VQNet to classify MNIST handwritten digits and CIFAR-10 datasets. The experiments showed that quantum machine learning has the advantages of efficiency, accuracy, and security over classical machine learning, which may be an improvement over classical machine learning. This research proposes a machine learning algorithm based on quantum computing, which promotes the development of quantum computing and quantum technology. At the same time, it provides a new solution and idea for image classification, enabling people to pursue faster and more accurate quantum machine learning instead of being limited to classical machine learning. © 2023 IEEE.","Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Networks; Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks; Quantum Machine Learning","Classification (of information); Computational complexity; Computational efficiency; Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Digital storage; Image classification; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Quantum efficiency; Quantum optics; Qubits; Classical neural networks; Convolutional neural network; Hybrid quantum-classical neural network; Images classification; Machine-learning; Quantum Computing; Quantum convolutional neural network; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum-classical; Complex networks","","","H.

In particular, the switch has to allocate quantum memories to clients to generate link-level entanglements (LLEs), and then use these to serve end-to-end entanglements requests. The paper's main contributions are (i) to characterize the switch's capacity region, and (ii) to propose a memory allocation policy (MEW) that is throughput optimal. The worst-case time complexity of MEW is exponential on the system parameters. However, when the requests are bipartite and the LLE attempts are always successful, we propose a variant of MEW (MEW2) that has polynomial time complexity. We evaluate the proposed policies numerically and illustrate their performance depending on the requests arrivals characteristics and the time available to obtain a memory allocation.  © 2023 IFIP.","","Memory architecture; Polynomial approximation; Storage allocation (computer); Allocation policies; Capacity regions; End to end; Limited memory; Memory constraints; Quantum memory; Quantum switch; Switch capacity; Throughput-optimal; Worst-case time; Quantum entanglement","Army Research Office MURI, (W911NF2110325); National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS 1955744, EEC-1941583 CQN ERC)","The research work was supported by the Army Research Office MURI under the project number W911NF2110325 and by the National Science Foundation under project numbers EEC-1941583 CQN ERC and CNS 1955744.

Currently entering an era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems brings additional design challenges. In these systems, each individual qubit is accompanied by a substantial amount of classical CMOS circuitry for qubit instantiation, control and readout, which is to be integrated at the cryo temperature. This work presents a methodology for the co-design and co-simulation of silicon spin qubits in quantum dots, together with their associated cryo-CMOS circuitry, relying on an established spin qubit compact model. In addition, a detailed procedure is proposed for the integration of the model into a classical design flow, which is crucial for the usability of the model in practice. This is illustrated by simulating the readout of a qubit using a complete CMOS readout chip that behaves in a realistic, nonideal way. Bringing the design to a single simulation environment allows for the capture and analysis of effects that otherwise are not possible to simulate when considering the qubits and the cryo-CMOS circuitry separately.

A promising approach is emerging based on the use of CMOS devices operating at deep-cryogenic temperatures, and several essential components have been demonstrated to operate at such temperatures, from basic MOSFETs to field-programmable gate arrays. In this letter, we show, for the first time, a voltage reference in a standard CMOS technology that can guarantee a stable voltage over a wide range of temperatures from 300 K down to deep-cryogenic temperatures. By exploiting CMOS transistors in dynamic-threshold MOS configuration, the proposed reference occupies only 445 μm2 in a standard 40-nm CMOS process, while showing a temperature coefficient below 0.8 mV/K over the temperature range from 4 to 300 K. These results demonstrate the feasibility of wide-range cryogenic voltage references to enable future cryogenic applications. © 2018 IEEE.","Bandgap; cryogenic; MOS; voltage reference","Cryogenics; Energy gap; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Molybdenum; MOSFET devices; Quantum computers; Temperature; Thermoelectricity; Voltage measurement; Cryogenic applications; Cryogenic temperatures; Dynamic threshold MOS; Quantum processors; Standard CMOS technology; Temperature coefficient; Temperature range; Voltage reference; CMOS integrated circuits","","","H.

However, the quantum computer has inherent issues. Firstly, it solves NP (non-deterministic polynomial) problems at a high speed only when a periodic Junction can be used in the process of calculation. Secondly, it is extremely difficult to increase the problem scale to be solved, which is determined by the number of quantum bits. To overcome the restrictions stemming from the quantum algorithm, we are studying the emulation by a FPGA (field programmable gate array). In this paper, first, it is explained why a periodic function is required for the algorithm of a quantum computer. Then, it is shown that the hardware emulator can solve NP problems at a high speed without using a periodic function.","","Problem solving; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Conventional computers; Fpga(field programmable gate array); Hardware emulators; Periodic function; Periodic junctions; Problem scale; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","0780383206; 978-078038320-3","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Previously, all measurements have to be done at the end of the circuit. Otherwise, it will incur significant errors. But it is not the case now. Recently IBM starts supporting dynamic circuit through hardware (instead of software by simulator). With mid-circuit hardware measurement, we can improve circuit efficacy and fidelity from three aspects: (a) reduced qubit usage, (b) reduced swap insertion, and (c) improved fidelity. We demonstrate this using real-world applications Bernstein Verizani on real hardware and show that circuit resource usage can be improved by 60%, and circuit fidelity can be improved by 15%. We design a compiler-assisted tool that can find and exploit the tradeoff between qubit reuse, fidelity, gate count, and circuit duration. We also developed a method for identifying whether qubit reuse will be beneficial for a given application. We evaluated our method on a representative set of important applications. We can reduce resource usage by up to 80% and improve circuit fidelity by up to 20%. © 2023 ACM.","circuit fidelity; mid-circuit measurement; qubit reuse; qubit usage","Program compilers; Timing circuits; Circuit fidelity; Compiler-assisted; Dynamic Circuits; Mid-circuit measurement; Quantum Computing; Quantum measurement; Qubit reuse; Qubit usage; Resource usage; Reuse; Qubits","National Quantum Information Science Research Centers, (DE-SC0012704); Rutgers Research Council, (NSF-FET-2129872); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC","We thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive and helpful feedback.

A quantum repeater is a small quantum computer capable of generating entangled qubit pairs with its neighboring repeaters and storing them in stable quantum memories. Once the entangled pairs are generated, it will perform Bell basis measurements, classical communication with appropriate repeaters, and single qubit gates necessary for entanglement swapping. For high fidelity operation, it might perform local operations and classical communications (LOCC) such as entanglement distillation [2] and/or quantum error correction [3,4].

Since qubits cannot be copied, this operation of moving qubits can be relatively costly in terms of resources. Moreover, implementation of quantum gates requires precise and extensive classical control and computation too. Accordingly, we consider the problem of dynamically permuting groups of qubits, i.e., qubit packets using reconfigurable quantum switches in which routing information is calculated classically as a possible way to reduce this cost. We design a 2 × 2 switch based on the controlled-swap quantum gate and show that if switch settings are determined using efficient classical algorithms, then quantum switches can be mapped onto classical non-blocking interconnection switch topologies with low cost by using this switch.

Product development is initiated next to the existing research and technology development activities. Quantum computer product roadmap: Considering the quantum computer as a product requires standardization and integration of all its building blocks and a mature supply chain that can provide high-quality components and can ensure security of supply. The product development approach puts focus on functionality and performance requirements of the product and uses state-of-the-art technology to build the product. Based on the expected requirements of future products it is possible to outline a product development roadmap. It is expected that a fully functional quantum computer will be available within a decade from now, and will be used by the High Performance Computing (HPC) market, where it will replace (part of) the supercomputers that are currently used for complex calculations and data management. In the short term, a partly functional quantum computer will be available and of interest to the R&D market, which has a need for such a product to expedite their quantum technology developments. ImpaQT project: In this paper, we present the product development approach and roadmap for quantum computers, based on superconducting circuits as an example. A group of companies in the Dutch quantum ecosystem (Quantum Delta) have joined forces and have started the ImpaQT project. The companies of the ImpaQT consortium form a local supply chain for key components of quantum computers. This paper shows that quantum community has reached the next level of maturity and that the quantum computer as a commercial product looks set to become a reality. © 2021, The Author(s).","Product development; Product roadmap; Quantum computer; Quantum technology; Supply-chain; Systems engineering","Commerce; Information management; Product development; Supercomputers; Supply chains; Development approach; High performance computing (HPC); High-quality components; Performance requirements; Quantum technologies; Research and Technology Development; State-of-the-art technology; Superconducting circuit; Qubits","Quantum Information Technology Test","The authors would like to thank TNO for granting permission to publish a photo of the Quantum Information Technology Test (QITT) facility.","G.J.N.

The state of an optical qubit may be measured in a momentum space by using laser micro-photoluminescence spectrum (Laser micro-PL spectrum) in combination with the Gaussian non-linear function fit of optical wavelengths and optical intensities and twice faster Fourier transformations of photoluminescence spectra at time and frequency domains. All architectures of self-assembled nanobiomedicine may be probed by conducting atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) in three dimensions (x, y, z axes) with a powerfully spatial resolution at sub-angstrom. The reproducible results of optical qubit measurements in self-assembled nanobiomedicine crystals more than six times by laser micro-PL spectra for one nanobiomedicine crystal sample were acquired, as shown in average values of wavelengths and intensities with standard deviations in laser micro-PL spectra.

We first show how to realize a controlled-NOT gate operation between two adjacent qubits without having to isolate the two qubits from qubits adjacent to them. The gate operation is implemented by applying two consecutive pulses of equal duration, but varying amplitudes, on the target qubit. Since only a single control parameter is required in implementing our scheme, it is very efficient. We next show how our scheme can be used to realize single qubit rotations and two-qubit controlledunitary operations. As most proposals for solid state implementations of a quantum computer use a onedimensional line of qubits, the schemes presented here will be extremely useful. © Rinton Press.","Controlledunitary; Linear nearest neighbour; Quantum architectures; Quantum computation; Toffoli gate","Quantum optics; Control parameters; Controlled-NOT gates; Controlledunitary; Fixed couplings; Gate operation; Linear nearest neighbors; Quantum architecture; Toffoli gates; Two-qubit; Universal quantum computing; Quantum computers","","","","","Rinton Press Inc.","15337146","","","","English","Quantum Inf.

Superconducting quantum chips can be prepared using a process similar to that of semiconductor chips, and are therefore of interest because of their natural advantages in terms of scalability. However, as the number of quantum bits increases, the z-control lines (magnetic field control lines) on the superconducting quantum chip also increase, leading to increased magnetic field crosstalk between individual control lines, which affects the fidelity of a single bit and further affects the arithmetic power of superconducting quantum computing. To address the above problems, this paper proposes two methods to reduce the magnetic field crosstalk between the control lines by modeling and simulating the superconducting quantum chip using air bridges and inflow structures, and the simulation results show that the magnetic field crosstalk between the control lines is significantly improved after the introduction of air bridges and inflow structures. This work provides a basis for further suppression of magnetic field crosstalk between the z-control lines of superconducting quantum chips.  © 2022 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Crosstalk; Qubits; Air inflow; Air-bridges; Control lines; Crosstalk suppression; Magnetic-field; Power; Quanta computers; Semiconductor chips; Single-bit; Suppression method; Magnetic fields","","","","","Institute of Physics","17426588","","","","English","J.

The solution is a set of ground states corresponding to jammed configurations in which no single particle can be moved without creating a non-zero potential. The problem is adapted to the quantum computer by discretizing space and mapping each point onto physical quantum-bits (qubits). An objective function is derived that defines the system energy for arbitrary particle locations, subject to constraints biasing solutions toward a pre-determined number of particles. Uniquely, the quantum computer samples and returns minimum values of this function finding low energy states, a subset of which are physically realizable solutions we seek.

In our current version, four qubits are already usable with in average 99.10% single-qubit gate fidelity and 97.15% two-qubit fidelity via randomized benchmaking tests. Improved control precisions as well as a new seven-qubit processor are also in preparation and will be available later. © 2017 Science China Press","Gradient ascent pulse engineering; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Quantum cloud; Randomized benchmarking","Magnetism; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Quantum optics; Resonance; Cloud services; Gradient ascent; Improved controls; Of quantum-information; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; Single-qubit gates; Software environments; Quantum computers","Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, CIFAR; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11175094); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (20173080024); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (11375167, 11421063, 11534002, 11605005, 2013CB921800, 2014CB848700, 2014CB921403, 2015CB921002, 2016YFA0301201, 61771278); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, (11425523); National Safety Academic Fund, NSAF, (U1530401)","We thank Yuanzhen Chen, Luyan Sun, Xiaoting Wang, Bixue Wang, Cheng Guo, Youning Li, Jianfeng Zhang, Qi-an Fu, Yicheng Bao, Benda Xu, Rulin Tang and Yanqiao Zhu for helpful comments and discussions.

In this CPWR, the states of one of the super conducting qubits can be moved to and recovered from the other qubit by microwave resonator photons. The superconducting qubits are relatively straightforward to fabricate from materials such as aluminium using electron beam lithography. The superconducting qubits, which are typically a few hundred micrometres in size, are well suited to perform fast quantum logic gate operations. The CPWR highly couples the two qubits through the tightly confined oscillating magnetic field of the resonator microwave photons.

With easy access to quantum computers, quantum information processing will potentially revolutionize computation, and superconducting transmon-based quantum computers are among some of the more promising devices available. Cloud service providers today host a variety of these and other prototype quantum computers with highly diverse device properties, sizes, and performances. The variation that exists in today's quantum computers, even among those of the same underlying hardware, motivate the study of how one device can be clearly differentiated and identified from the next. As a case study, this work focuses on the properties of 25 IBM superconducting, fixed-frequency transmon-based quantum computers that range in age from a few months to approximately 2.5 years. Through the analysis of current and historical quantum computer calibration data, this work uncovers key features within the machines, primarily frequency characteristics of transmon qubits, that can serve as a basis for a unique hardware fingerprint of each quantum computer.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Quantum optics; Qubits; Case-studies; Cloud service providers; Cloud-based; Device performance; Device properties; Device sizes; Diverse devices; Quanta computers; Quantum information processing; Computer hardware","NSF Quantum Leap Challenge Institute for Hybrid Quantum Architectures and Networks, (2016136); National Quantum Information Science Research Centers; STAQ, (2110860, NSF Phy-1818914); US Department of Energy Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC, (DE-AC05-00OR22725)","This work is funded in part by EPiQC, an NSF Expedition in Computing, under award CCF-1730449; in part by STAQ under award NSF Phy-1818914; in part by NSF award 2110860; in part by the US Department of Energy Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research, Accelerated Research for Quantum Computing Program; in part by the NSF Quantum Leap Challenge Institute for Hybrid Quantum Architectures and Networks (NSF Award 2016136); and in part based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, National Quantum Information Science Research Centers.

In solid-state experiments the oscillations show, next to the familiar exponential decay on time scales T1/2, an overall loss of amplitude. We solve the spin-boson model for a large class of initial conditions without the Markov approximation at the pure dephasing point. It is shown that a loss of visibility occurs in the form of a fast initial drop for factorized initial conditions and an overall reduction for entangled initial conditions. This loss of amplitude is distinct from r2-decoherence with the difference being most drastic for environments with real or pseudo-gaps. This result is explained by bandwidth effects in quantum noise as well as in terms of higher order phase-breaking processes. For several experiments, such gapped environments are identified. We confirm that this physics is valid beyond the pure dephasing point. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.","","Bosons; Optical properties; Quantum computers; Spin dynamics; Visibility; Boson models; Breaking processes; Decoherence; Dephasing; Exponential decays; Higher orders; Initial conditions; Markov approximations; Markovian; On times; Practical importances; Quantum computing; Quantum oscillations; Reduced visibilities; Motion estimation","","","F.

Current hardware lacks high fidelity gates, long coherence times, and the number of computational units required to perform meaningful computation. Contemporary quantum devices typically use a binary system, where each qubit exists in a superposition of the 0 and 1 states. However, it is often possible to access the 2 or even 3 states in the same physical unit by manipulating the system in different ways. In this work, we consider automatically encoding two qubits into one four-state ququart via a compression scheme. We use quantum optimal control to design efficient proof-of-concept gates that fully replicate standard qubit computation on these encoded qubits. We extend qubit compilation schemes to efficiently route qubits on an arbitrary mixed-radix system consisting of both qubits and ququarts, reducing communication and minimizing excess circuit execution time introduced by longer-duration ququart gates. In conjunction with these compilation strategies, we introduce several methods to find beneficial compressions, reducing circuit error due to computation and communication by up to 50  © 2023 ACM.","compilation; quantum computing; qudit","'current; Coherence time; Communication reduction; Compilation; Computational units; High-fidelity; Mixed radixes; Quantum Computing; Quantum device; Qudit; Qubits","ColdQuanta; NSF Quantum Leap Challenge Institute for Hybrid Quantum Architectures and Networks, (2016136); National Quantum Information Science Research Centers; STAQ, (2110860, NSF Phy-1818914); US Department of Energy Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC","This work is funded in part by EPiQC, an NSF Expedition in Computing, under award CCF-1730449; in part by STAQ under award NSF Phy-1818914; in part by NSF award 2110860; in part by the US Department of Energy Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research, Accelerated Research for Quantum Computing Program; and in part by the NSF Quantum Leap Challenge Institute for Hybrid Quantum Architectures and Networks (NSF Award 2016136) and in part based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, National Quantum Information Science Research Centers.

To realize a spin qubit, a single electron is isolated in an extremely small site on the surface of a semiconductor die. A large magnetic field is applied to ensure that the spin-up and spin-down states of the electron correspond to distinct energy levels.

Although there exist error mitigation or error-aware designs for quantum applications, the inherent fluctuation of noise (a.k.a., instability) can easily collapse the performance of error-aware designs. What's worse, users can even not be aware of the performance degradation caused by the change in noise. To address both issues, in this paper we use Quantum Neural Network (QNN) as a vehicle to present a novel compression-aided framework, namely QuCAD, which will adapt a trained QNN to fluctuating quantum noise. In addition, with the historical calibration (noise) data, our framework will build a model repository offline, which will significantly reduce the optimization time in the online adaption process. Emulation results on an earthquake detection dataset show that QuCAD can achieve 14.91% accuracy gain on average in 146 days over a noise-aware training approach. For the execution on a 7-qubit IBM quantum processor, ibm-jakarta, QuCAD can consistently achieve 12.52% accuracy gain on earthquake detection. © 2023 IEEE.","","Earthquakes; Errors; Quantum optics; Qubits; Earthquake detection; Error mitigation; Noise compression; Power; Quanta computers; Quantum applications; Quantum Computing; Quantum neural networks; Real-world; Scale-up; Quantum noise","Quantum Science and Engineering Center; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); Office of Science, SC","This work is supported in part by Mason’s Office of Research Innovation and Economic Impact (ORIEI) and Quantum Science and Engineering Center (QSEC).

Maximal length of these molecular electronics digital logic gates are no more than four nanometers and maximal width 2.5 nm. The results of light induced internal molecular motions in azo-dyes molecules have been used for the design of light driven logically controlled (OR, AND) molecular machines composed from organic photoactive electron donor dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene and ferrocene molecules, electron accepting tetracyano-indane molecule, and moving azo-benzene molecular fragment. Density functional theory (DFT) B3PW91/6-311G model calculations were performed for the geometry optimization of these molecular electronics logical gates. Applied DFT time dependent (DFT-TD/B3PW91) method and our visualization program give absorption spectra of designed molecular gates and show from which fragments electrons are hopping in various excited states. Quantum mechanical investigations of proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) values of Cu, Co, Zn, Mn and Fe biliverdin derivatives and their dimers using ab initio Hartree-Fock (HF) and DFT methods indicate that these modified derivatives should generate from one to twelve Quantum Bits (QuBits).

However, real benchmarks of the individual relaxation (T1) and dephasing (T2) times of the constituent qubits of state-of-the-art quantum processors have recently shown that the decoherence effects suffered by each particular qubit actually vary in intensity. In consequence, in this paper we introduce the independent nonidentically distributed (i.n.i.d.) noise model, a decoherence model that accounts for the nonuniform behavior of the decoherence parameters of qubits. Additionally, we use the i.n.i.d. model to study how it affects the performance of a specific family of quantum error correction codes known as planar codes. For this purpose we employ data from four state-of-the-art superconducting processors: ibmq_brooklyn, ibm_washington, Zuchongzhi, and Rigetti Aspen-M-1. Our results show that the i.i.d. noise assumption overestimates the performance of surface codes, which can suffer up to 95% performance decrements in terms of the code pseudothreshold when they are subjected to the i.n.i.d. noise model. Furthermore, we consider and describe two methods which enhance the performance of planar codes under i.n.i.d. noise. The first method involves a so-called reweighting process of the conventional minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder, while the second one exploits the relationship that exists between code performance and qubit arrangement in the surface code lattice. The optimum qubit configuration derived through the combination of the previous two methods can yield planar code pseudothreshold values that are up to 650% higher than for the traditional MWPM decoder under i.n.i.d. noise.  © 2022 American Physical Society.

In recent years, the outlines of all kinds of achieving quantum computation were devised. In 1999, the suggestion of superconductive electronic charge was designed by Nakamura in Japan, a nanometer-scale superconducting electrode connected to a reservoir via a Josephson junction constitutes an artificial two-level electronic system: a single-Cooper-pair box. In 2001, the plan of geometrical quantum computation was framed by Duan L M et al., the elementary unit of quantum computer is the quantum bit(quanbit). In 2002, based on an idea that spatial separation of charge states will enhance quantum coherence, Li X Q et al. propose a scheme for a quantum computation with the quantum bit constructed from two coupled quantum dots. In 2003, based on the analytical solution to the time-dependent Schödinger equation, Cen L X et al. evaluate the holonomic quantum computation beyond the adiabatic limit. Low dimensional nanostructures has attracted much attention due to their unique electronic and optical properties as well as potential applications in making electronic and optoelectronic devices. Quantum rings (QRs) stand as an alternative to quantum dots (QDs) as zero-dimensional structures. QRs were extensively applied in optoelectronics, microelectronics and quantum communication because its characteristic electronic shell structure, magnetic field response and transport properties. The potential power of quantum ring is based on the ability of quantum systems to be in a superposition of its basic states. Probability density distribution of electron in quantum bit of quantum ring was studied by solving precisely the time-independent Schrödinger equation. The numerical calculation for InAs quantum rings was carried, the material parameters are μ = 0.024m0, m0 is mass of free electron, the inner /outer radius of quantum rings is 20/40 nm. The numerical results indicate that probability density distribution of electron has something to do with coordinate and time. When time t, angle and height z are given, it does non-periodicity oscillates with increasing radius ρ. When time, angle and radius are given, it increasing firstly and falling secondly with increasing height and achieves maximum if z = h/2. When time, height and radius are given, it raises firstly and declines with increasing angle and achieves maximum if = π. And probability density distribution of electron in quantum bit of quantum ring does periodicity oscillating with time.","Quantum bit; Quantum ring; Schrödinger equation","","","","","","","10007032","","","","Chinese","Chin.

In this article, we measure, through GEANT4 simulations, the charge deposited by impinging neutrons in superconducting quantum devices. As we show, most atmospheric neutrons deposit sufficient energy to break the Cooper pairs and, thus, can potentially modify the qubit state. Then, with a dedicated circuit-level fault injector, we track the transient fault propagation in real quantum circuits and measure its impact on the output probabilities distribution.

Quantum algorithms are generally mapped onto a circuit of quantum gates that operate on multiple qubits. Unlike conventional digital bits, qubits can take a coherent state ranging from |0 to |1 on a continuous sphere, known as the Bloch Sphere and they are implemented based on several mechanisms.

To tackle this challenge and keep pace with rapidly evolving classical control requirements, full control stack access is essential to system-level optimization. We design a modular field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based system called QubiC to control and measure a superconducting quantum processing unit. The system includes room temperature electronics hardware, FPGA gateware, and engineering software. A prototype hardware module is assembled from several commercial off-the-shelf evaluation boards and in-house-developed circuit boards. Gateware and software are designed to implement basic qubit control and measurement protocols. System functionality and performance are demonstrated by performing qubit chip characterization, gate optimization, and randomized benchmarking sequences on a superconducting quantum processor operating at the Advanced Quantum Testbed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The single-qubit and two-qubit process fidelities are measured to be 0.9980 ± 0.0001 and 0.948 ± 0.004, respectively, by randomized benchmarking. With fast circuit sequence loading capability, the QubiC performs randomized compiling experiments efficiently and improves the feasibility of executing more complex algorithms. © 2021 by the Author(s).","Engineering software; field-programmable gate array (FPGA); gateware; hardware; noisy intermediate-scale quantum; qubit control","Access control; Benchmarking; Logic gates; Open source software; Open systems; Quantum optics; Qubits; Control and measurement; Engineering software; Field programmables; Field-programmable gate array; Gateware; Hardware; Measurement system; Noisy intermediate-scale quantum; Programmable gate array; Quantum bit control; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","National Quantum Information Science Research Center, (DE-AC02-05CH11231); Testbeds for Science program; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Advanced Scientific Computing Research, ASCR","This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Advanced Scientific Computing Research through the Testbeds for Science program, the High Energy Physics QUANTISED program, and the National Quantum Information Science Research Center’s Quantum Systems Accelerator program under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231.","G.

Quantum simulators enable us to program this interaction by using measurement operations. Measurements generally remove part of the entanglement built between the qubits in a simulator. While in simple cases entanglement may disappear at a constant rate as we measure qubits one by one, the evolution of entanglement under measurements for a given class of quantum states is generally unknown. We show that consecutive measurements of qubits in a simulator can lead to criticality, separating two phases of entanglement. Using up to 48 qubits, we prepare an entangled superposition of ground states to a classical spin model. Progressively measuring the qubits drives the simulator through an observable vitrification point and into a spin glass phase of entanglement. Our findings suggest coupling to a classical environment may drive critical phenomena in more general quantum states. © 2022, The Author(s).","","glass; quantum dot; coupling; evolution; quantum mechanics; simulator; vitrification; acceleration; Article; controlled study; entropy; measurement; phase transition; steady state; vitrification","Calcul Québec and Compute Canada; Fonds de recherche–Nature et technologies, (456431992); Ministère de l’Économie et de l’Innovation du Québec; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Université de Sherbrooke, UdeS; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Ministère de l’Économie et de l’Innovation du Québec via its contributions to its Research Chair in Quantum Computing and the IBM Q Hub of Institut quantique at Université de Sherbrooke.

In this era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, systematic miscalibrations, drift, and crosstalk in the control of qubits can lead to a coherent form of error that has no classical analog. Coherent errors severely limit the performance of quantum algorithms in an unpredictable manner, and mitigating their impact is necessary for realizing reliable quantum computations. Moreover, the average error rates measured by randomized benchmarking and related protocols are not sensitive to the full impact of coherent errors and therefore do not reliably predict the global performance of quantum algorithms, leaving us unprepared to validate the accuracy of future large-scale quantum computations. Randomized compiling is a protocol designed to overcome these performance limitations by converting coherent errors into stochastic noise, dramatically reducing unpredictable errors in quantum algorithms and enabling accurate predictions of algorithmic performance from error rates measured via cycle benchmarking. In this work, we demonstrate significant performance gains under randomized compiling for the four-qubit quantum Fourier transform algorithm and for random circuits of variable depth on a superconducting quantum processor. Additionally, we accurately predict algorithm performance using experimentally measured error rates. Our results demonstrate that randomized compiling can be utilized to leverage and predict the capabilities of modern-day noisy quantum processors, paving the way forward for scalable quantum computing. © 2021 authors.

In these cases, simple qubit control fails on short time scales because of coupling to leakage levels. We provide an easy to implement analytic formula that inhibits this leakage from any single-control analog or pixelated pulse. It is based on adding a second control that is proportional to the time derivative of the first. For realistic parameters of superconducting qubits, this strategy reduces the error by an order of magnitude relative to the state of the art, all based on smooth and feasible pulse shapes. These results show that even weak anharmonicity is sufficient and in general not a limiting factor for implementing quantum gates. © 2009 The American Physical Society.","","Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Analytic formula; Anharmonic oscillators; Anharmonicities; Limiting factors; Order of magnitude; Pulse shapes; Quantum Computing; Quantum gates; Short time scale; State of the art; Superconducting qubits; Time derivative; Two-level system; Quantum optics","","","","","","10797114","","PRLTA","","English","Phys Rev Lett","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-69949137595"

The extra power of the quantum computers comes about as it operates on information represented as qubits, or quantum bits, instead of bits and it can be in a superposition, entailing the proportions of 0 and 1 coexisting together. The topological quantum computer is an alternative design, which would use a radically different physical system to implement quantum computations. The existence of the nonabelian anyons could make the topological quantum computers to replace the conventional computer designs to scale up from individual qubits and logical gates to full fledged machines.","","Computation theory; Computer architecture; Computers; Logic design; Logic gates; Topology; Quantum bits; Quantum computers; Quantum knots; Qubits; Quantum theory","","","","","","00368733","","SCAMA","","English","Sci.

And they use room temperature classical electronic controllers for qubit read-out and control, which are bulky and complex, and limit the number of effective qubits to operate. There is a need for a higher level of integration and a large number of qubit operations, so the validation of CMOS technology at cryogenic temperature is required. This paper presents the study of device characteristics and design parameter variation of 180nm NMOS device. Also, the low noise transconductance amplifier is designed and simulated for noise performance at room temperature 300K and at cryogenic temperature 4K. The proposed design shows the noise figure of 5.3 dB and 0.272 dB at 300K and 4K, respectively. Also, it achieves the S21 of 14.4 dB and 17.4 dB at 300K and 4K, respectively with IIP3 of 19.64 dBm at 4K. This opens the scope for designing a CMOS qubit controller at cryogenic temperature in addition to the high level of integration.  © 2022 IEEE.","","CMOS integrated circuits; Cryogenics; Integrated circuit design; Qubits; Room temperature; Transconductance; CMOS technology; Cryogenic applications; Cryogenic temperatures; Device characteristics; Electronic controllers; Level of integrations; Lower noise; Quantum Computing; Qubit read-out; Transconductance amplifier; Noise figure","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166547309-5","","","English","Austrochip - Austrochip Workshop Microelectron.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142884504"

In these NISQ machines, each qubit is physically connected to a bounded number of neighbors. This limitation prevents most quantum programs from being directly executed on quantum devices. A compiler is required for converting a quantum program to a hardware-compliant circuit, in particular, making each two-qubit gate executable by mapping the two logical qubits to two physical qubits with a link between them. To solve this problem, existing studies focus on inserting SWAP gates to dynamically remap logical qubits to physical qubits. However, most of the schemes lack the consideration of time-optimality of generated quantum circuits, or are achieving time-optimality with certain constraints. In this work, we propose a theoretically time-optimal SWAP insertion scheme for the qubit mapping problem. Our model can also be extended to practical heuristic algorithms. We present exact analysis results by using our model for quantum programs with recurring execution patterns. We have for the first time discovered an optimal qubit mapping pattern for quantum fourier transformation (QFT) on 2D nearest neighbor architecture. We also present a scalable extension of our theoretical model that can be used to solve qubit mapping for large quantum circuits. © 2021 ACM.","NISQ; Noisy Intermediate Quantum Computers; QFT; Quantum Computing; Quantum Fourier Transformation; Qubit Mapping","Fourier transforms; Heuristic algorithms; Logic gates; Mapping; Optimization; Program compilers; Fourier transformations; Mapping pattern; Mapping problem; Nearest neighbors; Physical qubits; Quantum machines; Superconducting technology; Theoretical modeling; Qubits","Rutgers Research Council, (NSF-CCF-1628401)","We thank Ali Javadi-Abhari for being our shepherd and the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

Quantum algorithms for numerical integration utilize Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) (Brassard et al., 2002) in conjunction with Grover's algorithm. However, QAE is daunting to implement on NISQ devices since it typically relies on Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), which requires many ancilla qubits and controlled operations. To mitigate these challenges, a recently published QAE algorithm (Suzuki et al., 2020), which does not rely on QPE, requires a much smaller number of controlled operations and does not require ancilla qubits. We implement this new algorithm for numerical integration on IBM quantum devices using Qiskit and optimize the circuit on each target device. We discuss the application of this algorithm on two qubits and its scalability to more than two qubits on NISQ devices. © 2020 SPIE.","Monte Carlo Integration; Quantum Algorithm; Quantum Counting","Integration; Quantum communication; Qubits; Ancilla; Grover's Algorithm; Numerical integrations; Quantum algorithms; Quantum amplitude; Quantum device; Quantum phase estimation; Quantum optics","","","K.

Presently, superconducting quantum processors with >50 qubits are actively available. For these systems, fixed-frequency transmons are attractive because of their long coherence and noise immunity. However, scaling fixed-frequency architectures proves challenging because of precise relative frequency requirements. Here, we use laser annealing to selectively tune transmon qubits into desired frequency patterns. Statistics over hundreds of annealed qubits demonstrate an empirical tuning precision of 18.5 MHz, with no measurable impact on qubit coherence. We quantify gate error statistics on a tuned 65-qubit processor, with median two-qubit gate fidelity of 98.7%. Baseline tuning statistics yield a frequency-equivalent resistance precision of 4.7 MHz, sufficient for high-yield scaling beyond 103 qubit levels. Moving forward, we anticipate selective laser annealing to play a central role in scaling fixed-frequency architectures.

This potential deals with the phase structure of the strong interaction. We created a matrix representation of the Hamiltonian for this theory using discrete quantum mechanics [2]. We then feed this Hamiltonian to IBM's Qiskit package [3]. We run on IBM's 32-qubit quantum simulator, which approximates the ground state energy using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm [4]. This result is then compared with the exact ground state energy, which we can calculate classically since the matrices we use are still small enough. The bosonic Hamiltonian for a 6-qubit representation took over 1000 Pauli factors to represent fully. To improve our performance, we can look for a more efficient representation of this model's Hamiltonian. We will develop a better variational trial wave function and initial state, as well as include the effect of fermions and heavy quarks on the potential. © 2019 IEEE.","","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Elementary particles; Ground state; Hamiltonians; Qubits; Wave functions; Eigensolvers; Ground-state energies; Heavy-quark; Initial state; Matrix model; Matrix representation; Quantum simulators; Strong interaction; Matrix algebra","Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC; DOE HEP Office of Science, (DESC0019139); International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL","Funding text 1: This project was supported in part by the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Computational Science Initiative under the BNL Supplemental Undergraduate Research Program (SURP).

At present, the same quantum properties are being exploited with the aim of the physical implementation of quantum bits and quantum registers. Here we present measurements on a system containing potential qubits, namely a rf SQUID and a hysteretic dc SQUID, magnetically coupled, under microwave excitation; the devices are realized on a single chip with trilayer Nb/AlOx/Nb technology. On this system we have performed a set of measurements to test the dc SQUID response to short pulses of microwaves ranging from 2 to 32 GHz. A first analysis of our results indicates the presence of population oscillations in the hysteretic dc SQUID. This result is very promising in view of using SQUIDs for more complex qubits systems.","","Alumina; Capacitance; Critical currents; Hamiltonians; Josephson junction devices; Magnetic flux; Microwave measurement; Microwaves; Niobium; Plasmas; Quantum theory; Superconducting materials; Microwave excitation; Quantum bits; Quantum dynamics; Quantum registers; SQUIDs","","","C.

We have designed a ± 1.5V 10 bit cryogenic CMOS high speed current steering D/A converter which outputs both positive and negative analogue signals to trigger these qubits. Instead of using a current mirror at the output stage, a source and a full complementary sink structure are used to ensure lower power dissipation and to get fast output levels. Then to compensate the mismatch effects of current sources and to confirm that there are no missing analogue output steps (like missing code in an A/D converter), we have utilized an analogue charge storage based calibration method and extended the full calibration procedure to the least significant bits (LSB's). A novel charge injection reduction technique is presented in this paper that allows the analogue memory (stored charge on the gate capacitance of a MOSFET) to balance the nonlinearity problem caused by charge injection. The whole system has been designed and simulated using a standard 0.5μm CMOS Silicon-on-Sapphire (SOS) process. © 2010 IEEE.","","Calibration; Cryogenics; Pulse generators; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Static random access storage; A/D converter; Analogue signals; Calibration method; Calibration procedure; Charge storage; Cryogenic temperatures; Current mirrors; Current sources; D/A converters; Gate capacitance; High speed current steering; Least significant bits; Mismatch effects; Missing codes; MOS-FET; Non-Linearity; Output levels; Output stages; Pulse generation; Quantum bits; Quantum gate operations; Reduction techniques; Silicon quantum computers; Silicon-on-sapphire; Stored charge; Whole systems; Analog to digital conversion","","","Md.

Atoms localized close to the antinodes of the standing wave can realize phase-controlled quantum operations that are potentially more than an order of magnitude less sensitive to the local optical phase and atomic motion than corresponding travelling wave configurations. The scheme is compatible with robust optimal control techniques and spatial qubit addressing in atomic arrays to realize phase controlled operations without the need for tight focusing and precise positioning of the control lasers.

However, due to the lack of quantum computers circuit model of quantum algorithms are currently simulated using classical computers to verify their functionalities. On the other hand, software simulation cannot use the intrinsic parallelism of quantum algorithm efficiently. To address the problem, in this paper hardware emulation of quantum algorithms are discussed. To emulate quantum algorithms using FPGAs, a new representation for quantum bits is emulated that improves the emulation of quantum circuits considerably.

Here, each qubit is associated with a quantum circuit wire which is used to conduct the desired operations. Most of the existing quantum circuits allocate a single quantum circuit wire for each qubit and hence introduce significant overhead. In fact, qubits are usually not needed during the entire computation, only between their initialization and measurement. Before and after that, corresponding wires may be used by other qubits. In this work, we propose a solution which exploits this fact in order to optimize the design of quantum circuits with respect to the required wires. To this end, we introduce a representation of the lifetimes of all qubits which is used to analyze the respective need for wires. Based on this analysis, a method is proposed which ""recycles"" the available wires and, as a result, reduces the size of the resulting circuit. Numerical tests based on established reversible and fault-tolerant quantum circuits confirm that the proposed solution reduces the number of wires by more than 90% compared to unoptimized quantum circuits. © 2016 American Physical Society.","","Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Reconfigurable hardware; Timing circuits; Wire; Fault-tolerant; Numerical tests; Quantum bits; Quantum circuit; Quantum gates; Quantum-information processing; Single quantum; Electric network analysis","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (26540006)","","","","American Physical Society","24699926","","","","English","Phys.

Unlike software-based quantum computation simulators, which run on standard general-purpose computers and suffer from reduced performance, this hardware design, which is based on classical concepts of bits, registers and memories, aims to leverage pure parallelism and pipelined execution for efficient quantum computations via emulation. The architecture includes several key components: memories, computation unit, measurement unit and control unit. The quantum state memory stores the individual and group states of qubits. This memory is crucial for maintaining the quantum information required for quantum operations. Basic operators are stored in dedicated operator memory. Additionally, a scratch memory allows for larger operators to be dynamically built at runtime. The computation unit is responsible for performing complex number multiplications, which form the basis of tensor and matrix products necessary for executing quantum operations. A measurement unit enables quantum state sampling, which is an essential aspect of quantum computation. Furthermore, a control unit is incorporated to ensure the correct operation of the quantum processor’s data path. It utilizes a microprogram to manage and coordinate the functional units. All the functional units communicate with each other through dedicated and shared data buses, depending on the frequency of information exchange. This enables efficient data transfer and coordination among the components. The proposed hardware design has been simulated and proved to be effective in executing quantum operations. By exploiting parallelism and employing a pipelined execution, this architecture overcomes the limitations of software-based simulators, delivering improved performance for emulating quantum algorithms. We use Grover’s search algorithm as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the proposed hardware design and compare it to software-based simulation and to hardware-based algorithm-dedicated emulation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Computer software; Data transfer; General purpose computers; Integrated circuit design; Memory architecture; Pipeline processing systems; Quantum optics; Qubits; Supercomputers; Classical logic; Control unit; Dedicated hardware; Functional units; Hardware design; Performance; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum operations; Quantum state; Benchmarking","Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, FAPERJ, (201.013/2022)","This research work received funding from FAPERJ: Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro ( https://www.faperj.br/ ) in Brazil: Grant No. 201.013/2022.

Such systems with few tens to few hundreds of qubits are termed as Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum computers (NISQ), and these systems can provide benefits for a class of quantum algorithms. In this paper, we study the problem of Qubit-Allocation (mapping of program qubits to machine qubits) and Qubit-Movement (routing qubits from one location to another for entanglement) for NISQ machines. We observe that there can be variation in the error rates of different qubits and links, which can impact the decisions for qubit movement and qubit allocation. We analyze publicly available characterization data for the IBM-Q20 to quantify the variation and show that there is indeed significant variability in the error rates of the qubits and the links connecting them. We show that the device variability has a significant impact on the overall system reliability. To exploit the variability in error rate, we propose Variation-Aware Qubit Movement (VQM) and Variation-Aware Qubit Allocation (VQA), policies that optimize the movement and allocation of qubits to avoid the weaker qubits and links, and guide more operations towards the stronger qubits and links. Our evaluations, with a simulation-based model of IBM-Q20, show that Variation-Aware policies can improve the system reliability by up to 1.7x. We also evaluate our policies on the IBM-Q5 machine and demonstrate that our proposal significantly improves the reliability of real systems (up to 1.9X). © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Compilers; Noisy Intermediate Quantum Computers; Quantum Computers","Errors; Fault tolerance; Fault tolerant computer systems; Program compilers; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Error rate; Quantum algorithms; Real systems; Simulation-based modeling; System reliability; Variability-Aware; Qubits","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","978-145036240-5","85MCA","","English","Int Conf Archit Support Program Lang Oper Syst ASPLOS","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064606589"

However, the analogous quantum procedure (the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm) requires just one examination step. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm has been realized experimentally using bulk nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, employing nuclear spins as quantum bits (qubits). In contrast, the ion trap processor utilises motional and electronic quantum states of individual atoms as qubits, and in principle is easier to scale to many qubits. Experimental advances in the latter area include the realization of a two-qubit quantum gate, the entanglement of four ions, quantum state engineering and entanglement-enhanced phase estimation. Here we exploit techniques, developed for nuclear magnetic resonance to implement the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm on an ion-trap quantum processor, using as qubits the electronic and motional states of a single calcium ion. Our ion-based implementation of a full quantum algorithm serves to demonstrate experimental procedures with the quality and precision required for complex computations, confirming the potential of trapped ions for quantum computation.","","Atoms; Computational methods; Ions; Nuclear magnetic resonance; computer system; algorithm; article; computer; electronics; ion transport; laser; mathematical analysis; measurement; motion; nuclear magnetic resonance; optical instrumentation; polarimetry; priority journal; quantum chemistry; quantum mechanics; radiofrequency; vibration; Nuclear spins; Algorithms","","","","","","00280836","","NATUA","","English","Nature","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0037413630"

These solutions, however, must be interpreted in terms of Monte Carlo-style probabilistic occurrences and histograms of candidate solutions that presume the underlying statistics of the qubits are ""fair.""This paper quantifies the underlying fairness of individual qubits on a single D-Wave machine, showing that there is a measurable bias in the resulting solution as a function of which qubits are used in the calculation.

Electron's spin has been preferred to encode qubits in solid-state systems, as it decoheres much more slowly than charge. It is also possible to preserve the phase relation between variables a and b for a significantly longer duration when the qubit is encoded in spin in place of the charge. Spin coherence times of several microseconds have been demonstrated in nitrogen vacancies in diamond. It is observed that most of the proposals for scalable solid-state quantum computers use the notion of using an electron's spin to implement a qubit.

However, in the NISQ era pointed out by John Preskill in 2018, quantum noise and decoherence, which affect the accuracy and execution effect of quantum programs, cannot be ignored and corrected by the near future NISQ computers. In order to let users more easily write quantum programs, the compiler and runtime system should consider underlying quantum hardware features such as decoherence. To address the challenges posed by decoherence, in this paper, we propose and prototype QLifeReducer to minimize the qubit lifetime in the input OpenQASM program by delaying qubits into quantum superposition. QLifeReducer includes three core modules, i.e., the parser, parallelism analyzer and transformer. It introduces the layered bundle format to express the quantum program, where a set of parallelizable quantum operations is packaged into a bundle. We evaluate quantum programs before and after transformed by QLifeReducer on both real IBM Q 5 Tenerife and the self-developed simulator. The experimental results show that QLifeReducer reduces the error rate of a quantum program when executed on IBMQ 5 Tenerife by 11%; and can reduce the longest qubit lifetime as well as average qubit lifetime by more than 20% on most quantum workloads. © 2019 IEEE.","Decoherence; Quantum program transformation; Qubit lifetime","Quantum noise; Quantum optics; Qubits; Decoherence; Hardware features; Program transformations; Quantum Computing; Quantum operations; Quantum superpositions; Qubit lifetime; Runtime systems; Program compilers","Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies, (AHY150100); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61772487); Anhui Provincial University Teaching Quality and Teaching Reform Project, (2017jyxm0005)","This work was partly supported by the grants of Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies(No. AHY150100), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61772487) and Anhui Provincial Major Teaching and Research Project (No. 2017jyxm0005).

They can encode quantum information onto electron or nuclear spins and some of them show important features as the scalability of the number of qubits and a universal set of quantum gates. In this paper we present our advances in the development of a classical simulation infrastructure for molecular Quantum Computing: starting from the definition of simplified models taking into account the main physical features of each analyzed molecule, quantum gates are defined over these models, thus permitting to take into account the real behavior of each technology during the simulation. An interface with a hardware-agnostic description language has been also developed. The knowledge of the behavior of real systems permits to optimize the design of quantum circuits at both physical and compilation levels. Elementary quantum algorithms have been simulated on three different molecular technologies by changing the physical parameters of polarization and manipulation and quantum circuit design strategies. Results confirm the dependency of the fidelity of the results on both levels, thus proving that the choice of optimal operating points and circuit optimization techniques as virtual-Z gates are fundamental for ensuring the execution of quantum circuits with negligible errors. © 2020 IEEE.","Innovative technology; Molecular nanomagnets; Molecular quantum computing; Quantum computing architectures","Computer hardware description languages; Integrated circuit manufacture; Logic gates; Molecules; Quantum channel; Quantum optics; Qubits; Timing circuits; VLSI circuits; Circuit optimization; Classical simulation; Description languages; Molecular technologies; Optimal operating point; Physical parameters; Quantum circuit design; Quantum Information; Computer circuits","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","21593469","978-172815775-7","","","English","Proc.

Distance between two points can be hundreds of thousands of lightyears. For quantum teleportation, there is no need for a channel between two points when sending a state vector from one place to another. Since classical information sharing is possible, it is also possible to send a state vector from one place to another place. Teleportation is the transfer of a quantum state from one place to another through classical channels. Superdense coding, a dual to teleportation, uses a single quantum bit to transmit two bits classical information. Superdense coding uses a qubit to transfer two classical bits, while teleportation performs one qubit transfer using two classical bits. In this article, teleportation, superdense coding algorithms, and the Bell's inequality test in which Bell's inequality is violated with quantum mechanics are performed on both Qiskit and International Business Machines circuit composer, and results are compared and presented in detail. The results revealed that whether a faster-than-light signal transfer is possible using quantum mechanics depends on whether a copy of the quantum state is created or not.

Since swap gates perform no useful computation, they can be viewed as an overhead whose number should be minimised in efficient quantum programs. The location of the swap gates in a quantum circuit are chosen by minimising an objective function characterising the structure of the quantum circuit. Those which currently offer the lowest swap cost reduce the significance of each gate to the objective function relative to its position in the circuit. The criterion that describes how quickly the significance must decrease. In this paper, we show that to satisfy this criterion, it is necessary and sufficient for the decay to be exponential. However, when applying this new objective function, there is no significant improvement over the old function, with most of the benchmark circuits having less than 5% improvement. Only three circuits had more than 10% improvement in swap cost, and these circuits were all less than 100 gates long. The three longest circuits in the benchmark suite had less than 1% change in swap cost. There is also a significant penalty in run time, in one case reaching 265.48%. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","","Computer architecture; Embedded systems; Qubits; Timing circuits; Benchmark circuit; Benchmark suites; Nearest neighbour; Objective functions; Proposed architectures; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum state; Quantum optics","","","L.

While qubit-bath couplings generally lead to qubit relaxation and dephasing, qubit-qubit couplings are often used to manipulate or control quantum states. We investigate the available control operations in two DD schemes, named periodic DD (PDD) and Uhrig DD (UDD), to see whether universal quantum computation can be realized in these decoupled systems.

Several different quantum circuits implementing Shor's algorithm have been designed, but each tacitly assumes that arbitrary pairs of qubits within the computer can be interacted. While some quantum computer architectures possess this property, many promising proposals are best suited to realising a single line of qubits with nearest neighbour interactions only. In light of this, we present a circuit implementing Shor's factorisation algorithm designed for such a linear nearest neighbour architecture. Despite the interaction restrictions, the circuit requires just 2L + 4 qubits and to leading order requires 8L4 2-qubit gates arranged in a circuit of depth 32L3 - identical to leading order to that possible using an architecture that can interact arbitrary pairs of qubits.","Linear nearest neighbour; Quantum circuit; Shor's algorithm","Computer architecture; Computer hardware; Integer-N; Leading orders; Nearest neighbour; Nearest-neighbour interactions; Quantum circuit; Qubit arrays; Shor's algorithms; Time polynomials; Qubits","","","","","Rinton Press Inc.","15337146","","","","English","Quantum Inf.

Presto uses direct digital synthesis to create signals up to 9 GHz on 16 synchronous output ports, while synchronously analyzing responses on 16 input ports. Presto has 16 DC-bias outputs, four inputs and four outputs for digital triggers or markers, and two continuous-wave outputs for synthesizing frequencies up to 15 GHz. Scaling to a large number of qubits is enabled through deterministic synchronization of multiple Presto units. A Python application programming interface configures a firmware for synthesis and analysis of pulses, coordinated by an event sequencer. The analysis integrates template matching (matched filtering) and low-latency (184-254 ns) feedback to enable a wide range of multi-qubit experiments. We demonstrate Presto's capabilities with experiments on a sample consisting of two superconducting qubits connected via a flux-tunable coupler. We show single-shot readout and active reset of a single qubit; randomized benchmarking of single-qubit gates showing 99.972% fidelity, limited by the coherence time of the qubit; and calibration of a two-qubit iSWAP gate.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Application programming interfaces (API); Application specific integrated circuits; Digital radio; Radio waves; Software radio; Direct digital synthesis; Fully integrated; Measurement and control; Output ports; Quantum processors; Radio frequency systems; Single quantum; System on a chip; Systems-on-a-chip; Third generation; article; benchmarking; calibration; controlled study; filtration; microwave radiation; radiofrequency; randomized controlled trial; synthesis; Firmware","Wallenberg Launch Pad; Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse; Wallenberg Center for Quantum Technology, Chalmers University of Technology, WACQT","The authors thank Joe Aumentado and the Advanced Microwave Photonics Group at NIST Boulder, CO, for providing the Josephson parametric amplifier used in this study.

To fully leverage the potential of quantum computing, quantum processors will likely have to incorporate billions of high-quality qubits. Several approaches are being pursued and exhibit different strength and weaknesses. The device concepts and fabrication procedures for semiconductor based qubits are very similar to those used in the semiconductor industry. Using the spin-degree of freedom, their coherence properties and the quality of single-qubit operations have now reached the required level and are on par with competing approaches. Two-qubit operations will likely follow suit in the near future. With these basic requirements being met, it is now time to think if and how increasingly large multi-qubit systems and eventually functional quantum processor can be realized. This quest raises many pertinent questions, some of which equally apply to other qubit platforms. How reproducibly can the different types of semiconductor qubits be produced? How can their operating point be adjusted efficiently and in an automated way? How can they be connected to form meaningful multi-qubit circuits? How severe are multi-qubit control issues such as crosstalk and frequency crowding, and how can they be avoided? What control system architectures are most suitable for operating large numbers of qubits? What is the limit of cryogenic electronics regarding power consumption and integration density? This paper gives a (partial) overview of the state of the art in the field and discusses future challenges associated with the realization of large-scale quantum processors, many of which will greatly benefit from input from engineering science. The guiding vision is that of a highly integrated quantum processor with an ultra-low power cryogenic control system. © 2019 IEEE","","Control systems; Cryogenics; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Lattice constants; Quantum optics; Semiconductor device manufacture; Basic building block; Control system architecture; Cryogenic control systems; Cryogenic electronics; Fabrication procedure; Semiconductor industry; Single qubit operations; Two-qubit operations; Qubits","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","02714310","978-172810397-6","PICSD","","English","Proc IEEE Int Symp Circuits Syst","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066813833"

To address this challenge, we propose a behavioral-level model of a superconducting qubit and its control electronics, followed by a co-simulation to evaluate their performance. In this paper, we present the modeling process, simulation procedure, and resulting design specifications for the qubit control system. Our co-simulation approach utilizes MATLAB and Simulink, enabling us to derive critical circuit design specifications, such as the required Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) resolution, which should be 8 bits or higher, to achieve high-fidelity control. By taking into account factors such as DAC sampling rates, integral and differential nonlinearities, and filter characteristics, we optimize the control system for efficient and accurate qubit manipulation.

In this field configuration, it is possible to excite the motional sidebands of a trapped ion while suppressing the off- resonant coupling to the corresponding carrier transition. This is of particular interest for quantum information processing, as it would allow implementing faster and lower error Molmer-Sorensen entangling gates.We characterize the optical properties of the chip by scanning with sub-wavelength resolution the position of a single ion through the standing wave and observing Rabi oscillations for carrier and first motional sideband of different quadrupole transitions. We characterize both the strength of resonant couplings and the AC Stark shift induced by off-resonant couplings. We measure noise and drifts in the ion position and observe high stability in the standing wave profile without the need for active phase stabilization.Integrated optics allow to reliably reproduce the same field configuration in different regions of the chip, opening the way for implementing distributed, parallel quantum operations. We show the ability to control ions in different regions of the trap at the same time. We implemented real-time control of the DC voltages controlling the axial configuration of the trapping potential which enables us to load multiple ion crystals, merge, split, and shuttle them across the device.  © 2022 IEEE.","","Elastic waves; Electric loads; Optical properties; Quantum optics; Real time control; Stabilization; Integrated photonics; Interfering beams; Motional sidebands; Multizone; Paul trap; Photonic elements; Resonant couplings; Standing wave; Surface electrode; Surface trap; Trapped ions","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166549113-6","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

While matter-based qubit platforms such as superconducting qubits have received the most attention so far, there is a rising interest in photonic qubits lately, which show advantages in parallelism, speed, and scalability. Photonic qubits are best served by the paradigm of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). To deliver the promise of measurement-based photonic quantum computing (MBPQC), the photon cluster state depth and photon utilization are two of the most important metrics. However, little attention has been paid to optimizing the depth and utilization when mapping quantum circuits to the photon clusters. In this paper, we propose a compiler framework that achieves automatic and dynamic depth and utilization optimizations. Our approach consists of an MBPQC mapping mechanism that maps optimized measurement patterns on a cluster state and a cluster state pruning strategy that removes all possible redundancies without impacting the circuit functions. Experimental results on five quantum benchmark with three different qubit numbers indicate our approach achieves an average of 63.4% cluster depth reduction and 22.8% photon utilization improvements. © 2023 IEEE.","Compiler; Quantum Computer","Cluster computing; Mapping; Program compilers; Quantum optics; Qubits; Applications domains; Cluster state; Compiler; Measurement-based; Measurement-based quantum computation; Photon utilization; Photonic qubits; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; Photons","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1725657, 1910413, 2011146, 2154973, 2204985)","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback and suggestions.

These studies, although very useful, are often designed for fault-tolerant quantum computers that are far from reality of today’s noise-prone quantum computers. While companies such as IBM have ushered in a new era of quantum computing by allowing public access to their quantum computers, quantum noise as well as decoherence are daunting obstacles that not only degrade the performance of quantum algorithms, but also make them infeasible for running on current-era quantum processors. We address the feasibility of a quantum machine learning algorithm on IBM quantum processors to shed light on their efficacy and weaknesses to design noise-aware algorithms that work around these limitations.

Quantum information processing (QIP) harnesses this profound phenomenon to manipulate information in radically new ways. A fundamental challenge in all QIP technologies is the corruption of superposition in a quantum bit (qubit) through interaction with its environment. Quantum bang-bang control provides a solution by repeatedly applying 'kicks' to a qubit, thus disrupting an environmental interaction. However, the speed and precision required for the kick operations has presented an obstacle to experimental realization. Here we demonstrate a phase gate of unprecedented speed on a nuclear spin qubit in a fullerene molecule, and use it to bang-bang decouple the qubit from a strong environmental interaction. We can thus trap the qubit in closed cycles on the Bloch sphere, or lock it in a given state for an arbitrary period. Our procedure uses operations on a second qubit, an electron spin, to generate an arbitrary phase on the nuclear qubit. We anticipate that the approach will be important for QIP technologies, especially at the molecular scale where other strategies, such as electrode switching, are unfeasible. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.","","Bang bang control systems; Electrospinning; Fullerenes; Intelligent control; Magnetic moments; Molecules; Quantum optics; Spin dynamics; Bang-Bang control; Environmental interactions; Experimental realizations; Fullerene molecules; Molecular scale; Multiple state; Quantum bit (qubit); Quantum-information processing; Qubits","Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, MPS, (0213706)","","J.J.L.

The parallel execution of multiple instructions in quantum computation causes crosstalk, which causes coupling between signal lines and mutual inductance and capacitance between signal lines, destroying the quantum state and causing the program to fail to execute correctly. Overcoming crosstalk is a critical prerequisite for quantum error correction and large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing. This paper provides an approach for suppressing crosstalk in quantum computers based on multiple instruction exchange rules and duration. Firstly, for the majority of the quantum gates that can be executed on quantum computing devices, a multiple instruction exchange rule is proposed. The multiple instruction exchange rule reorders quantum gates in quantum circuits and separates double quantum gates with high crosstalk on quantum circuits. Then, time stakes are inserted based on the duration of different quantum gates, and quantum gates with high crosstalk are carefully separated in the process of quantum circuit execution by quantum computing equipment to reduce the influence of crosstalk on circuit fidelity. Several benchmark experiments verify the proposed method’s effectiveness. In comparison to previous techniques, the proposed method improves fidelity by 15.97% on average. © 2023 by the authors.","command exchange rules; crosstalk; duration; quantum circuit; time stake","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62072259); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20151274, BK20221411); Nantong University, NTU, (23B03)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62072259), the Jiangsu Province Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (BK20151274), the PhD Start-up Fund of Nantong University under Grant (No. 23B03), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under Grant (BK20221411).","Z.

This work presents the first systematic design of such a controller to simultaneously and accurately manipulate the states of multiple spin qubits or transmons. By employing both analytical and simulation techniques, the detailed electrical specifications of the controller have been derived for a single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.99% and validated using a qubit Hamiltonian simulator. Trade-offs between several architectures with different levels of digitization are discussed, resulting in the selection of a highly digital DDS-based solution. Initiating from the system specifications, a complete error budget for the various analog and digital circuit blocks is drafted and their detailed electrical specifications, such as signal power, linearity, spurs and noise, are derived to obtain a digital-intensive power-optimized multi-qubit controller. A power consumption estimate demonstrates the feasibility of such a system in a nanometer CMOS technology node. Finally, application examples, including qubit calibration and multi-qubit excitation, are simulated with the proposed controller to demonstrate its efficacy. The proposed methodology, and more specifically, the proposed error budget lay the foundations for the design of a scalable electronic controller enabling large-scale quantum computers with practical applications.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Direct digital synthesis (DDS); fidelity; frequency division multiplexing; quantum computing; qubit control; specifications","Budget control; Controllers; Economic and social effects; Electric power system control; Integrated circuit design; Specifications; Spin fluctuations; System-on-chip; Analog and digital circuits; Application examples; Control electronics; Electronic controllers; Large scale quantum computers; Simulation technique; Single-qubit gates; System specification; Qubits","Intel Corporation","Manuscript received February 7, 2020; revised June 5, 2020 and July 18, 2020; accepted August 16, 2020.

An error-protected quantum computer needs thousands or even millions of qubits operating at cryogenic temperature. Albeit the rapid development of highly-integrated quantum processors [1], future scalability may still be largely limited by the cables connecting the processors and peripheral control/processing units [2]; because even using low-thermal-conductivity metal materials, those cables still transport non-negligible amount of heat due to the large temperature gradient. In a dilution refrigerator, a stainless-steel UT-085-SS-SS cable could pose close to one mW of heat load to the 4K stage, and tens of mW to the 50K stage [2]. To drive such a non-copper cable in the cryogenic-to-RT (i.e. uplink) data path, standard I/O circuits in cooled sensors/processors typically consume pJ/b-level energy, further raising the overall heat load. Recently, optical fibers along with cryogenic InGaAs photodiode [3] and VCSEL lasers [4] are used for <20mK coherent qubit control/readout mode and 4K-to-300K uplink data mode, respectively. The energy consumption in [4] reduces to 406.2fJ/b at 10Gbps and < 10 -12 bit-error-rate (BER). In this paper, a terahertz (THz) transceiver chip operating at 4K is presented as a CMOS-based, fully-integrable alternative to the interconnect solutions above. The carrier frequency of 260GHz, which is determined based on the trade-off between the antenna dimension and the efficiency of the transistors, is sufficiently high to minimize the link footprint and to avoid potential disturbance of qubits, such as the superconducting or nitrogen-vacancy ones, that typically operate at gigahertz; on the other hand, it also leads to much lower quantum noise (sim hbaromega) compared to that in photonic links. The transceiver avoids the power-hungry terahertz (THz) generation by adopting a passive backscatter communication scheme (Fig. 34.1.1), and a 4Gbps uplink is demonstrated with only 176fJ/b added heat load. In the downlink, the heat load is further reduced to 34fJ/b at 4.4Gbps. This fully contactless 4K-RT interface can be used to deliver digitized control/readout data, and even some analog/RF signals such as low phase noise clocks. © 2023 IEEE.","","Cables; CMOS integrated circuits; Cryogenics; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Gallium alloys; Indium alloys; Optical fibers; Quantum chemistry; Room temperature; Semiconducting indium gallium arsenide; Semiconductor alloys; Thermal conductivity; Thermal load; Contact less; Data interfaces; High sensitivity; Imaging arrays; Large-scale systems; Lows-temperatures; Quanta computers; Signal connections; Tera Hertz; Terahertz imaging; Bit error rate","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","01936530","978-166542800-2","DTPCD","","English","Dig Tech Pap IEEE Int Solid State Circuits Conf","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151677464"

It translates quantum information into classical information enabling subsequent classification to assign the qubit states ‘0’ or ‘1’. Unfortunately, qubit readout is one of the most error-prone and slowest operations on a superconducting quantum processor. On state-of-the-art superconducting quantum processors, readout errors can range from 1-10%. These errors occur for various reasons – crosstalk, spontaneous state transitions, and excitation caused by the readout pulse. The error-prone nature of readout has resulted in significant research to design better discriminators to achieve higher qubit-readout accuracies. High readout accuracy is essential for enabling high fidelity for near-term noisy quantum computers and error-corrected quantum computers of the future. Prior works have used machine-learning-assisted single-shot qubit-state classification, where a deep neural network was used for more robust discrimination by compensating for crosstalk errors. However, the neural network size can limit the scalability of systems, especially if fast hardware discrimination is required. This state-of-the-art baseline design cannot be implemented on off-the-shelf FPGAs used for the control and readout of superconducting qubits in most systems, which increases the overall readout latency as discrimination has to be performed in software. In this work, we propose herqles, a scalable approach to improve qubit-state discrimination by using a hierarchy of matched filters in conjunction with a significantly smaller and scalable neural network for qubit-state discrimination. We achieve substantially higher readout accuracies (16.4% relative improvement) than the baseline with a scalable design that can be readily implemented on off-the-shelf FPGAs. We also show that herqles is more versatile and can support shorter readout durations than the baseline design without additional training overheads. © 2023 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Appropriate for both university students as well as software developers interested in programming a quantum computer, this practical approach to modern quantum computing takes the reader through the required background and up to the latest developments. Beginning with introductory chapters on the required math and quantum mechanics, Fundamentals of Quantum Computing proceeds to describe four leading qubit modalities and explains the core principles of quantum computing in detail. Providing a step-by-step derivation of math and source code, some of the well-known quantum algorithms are explained in simple ways so the reader can try them either on IBM Q or Microsoft QDK. The book also includes a chapter on adiabatic quantum computing and modern concepts such as topological quantum computing and surface codes. Features: Foundational chapters that build the necessary background on math and quantum mechanics. Examples and illustrations throughout provide a practical approach to quantum programming with end-of-chapter exercises. Detailed treatment on four leading qubit modalities -- trapped-ion, superconducting transmons, topological qubits, and quantum dots -- teaches how qubits work so that readers can understand how quantum computers work under the hood and devise efficient algorithms and error correction codes. Also introduces protected qubits - 0-p qubits, fluxon parity protected qubits, and charge-parity protected qubits. Principles of quantum computing, such as quantum superposition principle, quantum entanglement, quantum teleportation, no-cloning theorem, quantum parallelism, and quantum interference are explained in detail. A dedicated chapter on quantum algorithm explores both oracle-based, and Quantum Fourier Transform-based algorithms in detail with step-by-step math and working code that runs on IBM QisKit and Microsoft QDK. Topics on EPR Paradox, Quantum Key Distribution protocols, Density Matrix formalism, and Stabilizer formalism are intriguing. While focusing on the universal gate model of quantum computing, this book also introduces adiabatic quantum computing and quantum annealing. This book includes a section on fault-tolerant quantum computing to make the discussions complete. The topics on Quantum Error Correction, Surface codes such as Toric code and Planar code, and protected qubits help explain how fault tolerance can be built at the system level. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

Expressing these quantum algorithms using a high-level language and making them executable on a quantum processor while abstracting away hardware details is a challenging task. First, a quantum programming language should provide an intuitive programming interface to describe those algorithms. Then a compiler has to transform the program into a quantum circuit, optimize it, and map it to the target quantum processor respecting the hardware constraints such as the supported quantum operations, the qubit connectivity, and the control electronics limitations. In this article, we propose a quantum programming framework named OpenQL, which includes a high-level quantum programming language and its associated quantum compiler. We present the programming interface of OpenQL, we describe the different layers of the compiler and how we can provide portability over different qubit technologies. Our experiments show that OpenQL allows the execution of the same high-level algorithm on two different qubit technologies, namely superconducting qubits and Si-Spin qubits. Besides the executable code, OpenQL also produces an intermediate quantum assembly code, which is technology independent and can be simulated using the QX simulator.  © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","Quantum circuit; Quantum compiler; Quantum computing; Quantum processor","High level languages; Program compilers; Qubits; Classical problems; Higher-level languages; Programming framework; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum compiler; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; Quantum programming; Quantum programming languages; Timing circuits","Intel Corporation","This project is funded by Intel Corporation.

Despite early research on it, the research remains on quantum gates or small-size quantum algorithms without correlation. In this paper, we propose a quantum multi-programming (QMP) algorithm for Grover’s search. Our algorithm decomposes Grover’s algorithm by the partial diffusion operator and executes the decomposed circuits in parallel by QMP. We proved that this new algorithm increases the rotation angle of the Grover operator which, as a result, increases the success probability. The new algorithm is implemented on IBM quantum computers and compared with the canonical Grover’s algorithm and other variations of Grover’s algorithms. The empirical tests validate that our new algorithm outperforms other variations of Grover’s algorithms as well as the canonical Grover’s algorithm. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Grover’s search; Multi-programming; NISQ algorithm; Quantum computing","Computer programming; Quantum theory; Grov’s search; Multi-programming; NISQ algorithm; Programming algorithms; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum gates; S-algorithms; Qubits","Microsoft Azure Quantum, (35984); National Quantum Information Science Research Centers, (DE-SC0012704); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DDR-ERCAP0022229, DE-AC02-05CH11231); Office of Science, SC, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL","Funding text 1: We would like to thank the Brookhaven National Laboratory operated IBM-Q Hub.

However, QM and QP systems demonstrated so far suffer from many limitations, and in the near future a single platform will not have the optimal version of all the components needed for QIP. Thus, it is also important to be able to couple quantum bits in different systems, for example, Rb atoms and NV diamond, preferably using telecom fibres. In this paper, we describe a quantum frequency converter (QFC) that will perform this telecom band qubit conversion. The QFC is based on periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides. For concreteness, we consider specific examples: the conversion of a 780 nm or 795 nm Rb qubit to the telecom band and the conversion of a 637 nm photonic NV diamond qubit to the telecom band, as well as the inverse processes. We show that interface fidelity exceeding 95% should be feasible. Given the storage times 1 s already demonstrated in the solid-state systems, and the recent demonstrations of spin-photon entanglement with the NV and entanglement of the NV spin with a superconducting flux qubit operating in the microwave region near 2.88 GHz, such a link would provide the key interface needed to build a quantum internet. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Quantum computers; Rubidium; Telecommunication; Telecommunication links; Interface fidelity; Inverse process; Microwave region; Periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides; Quantum bits; Quantum memories; Quantum processors; Quantum-information processing; Single platform; Solid-state system; Superconducting flux; Telecom; Telecom bands; Quantum entanglement","","","M.S.

The Run-Time could mean a risk for most of the classical algorithms; if not all. While the classical system depends on the sequential order of bits, quantum system will utilize simultaneous multi-channel submissions. These submissions can be used in several aspects of the quantum system, which include hardware, software, and applications. Also, the power of cryptographic algorithms is based on the processing machine or the Run-Time Execution (RTE). In cryptography, the preference usually is given to simple and fast processing algorithms, where in this paper will compare between two Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Protocol algorithms. The comparison will discuss and demonstrate the Run-Time Execution between the SARG04 and AK15 Protocols, and both algorithms will be applied to the same number of qubits as well as the measurement mechanism. In addition, both protocols will be experienced to investigate the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER), and the possibility of the QBER occurs during qubits transmissions. © 2021 IEEE.","Entanglement state; EPR; Parity state; Polarization state; Quantum key distribution (QKD)","Application programs; Bit error rate; Chromium compounds; Computer operating procedures; Privacy by design; Quantum optics; Qubits; Cryptographic algorithms; Cryptographic methods; Measurement mechanism; Processing machines; Quantum bit error rate; Quantum key distribution protocols; Run-time execution; Sequential ordering; Quantum cryptography","","","A.A.

Nonetheless, there can be non-trivial upper bounds on both Bob's probability of correctly estimating Alice's commitment and Alice's probability of successfully unveiling whatever bit she desires. In this paper, we seek to determine these bounds for generalizations of the BB84 bit commitment protocol. In such protocols, an honest Alice commits to a bit by randomly choosing a state from a specified set and submitting this to Bob, and later unveils the bit to Bob by announcing the chosen state, at which point Bob measures the projector onto the state. Bob's optimal cheating strategy can be easily deduced from well known results in the theory of quantum state estimation. We show how to understand Alice's most general cheating strategy, (which involves her submitting to Bob one half of an entangled state) in terms of a theorem of Hughston, Jozsa and Wootters. We also show how the problem of optimizing Alice's cheating strategy for a fixed submitted state can be mapped onto a problem of state estimation. Finally, using the Bloch ball representation of qubit states, we identify the optimal coherent attack for a class of protocols that can be implemented with just a single qubit. These results provide a tight upper bound on Alice's probability of successfully unveiling whatever bit she desires in the protocol proposed by Aharonov et al., and lead us to identify a qubit protocol with even greater security.","BB84; Bit Commitment; Quantum Cryptography; Two-party protocols","Probability; Quantum cryptography; Qubits; State estimation; BB84; Bit commitment; Bit-commitment protocols; Entangled state; Quantum bits; Single qubits; Two-party protocols; Unconditionally secure; Quantum entanglement","","","R.W.

Here we resolve this conflict by establishing the feasibility of surface code quantum computing using solid-state spins, or ‘data qubits’, that are widely separated from one another. We use a second set of ‘probe’ spins that are mechanically separate from the data qubits and move in and out of their proximity. The spin dipole–dipole interactions give rise to phase shifts; measuring a probe’s total phase reveals the collective parity of the data qubits along the probe’s path. Using a protocol that balances the systematic errors due to imperfect device fabrication, our detailed simulations show that substantial misalignments can be handled within fault-tolerant operations. We conclude that this simple ‘orbital probe’ architecture overcomes many of the difficulties facing solid-state quantum computing, while minimising the complexity and offering qubit densities that are several orders of magnitude greater than other systems. © 2016 University of New South Wales/Macmillan Publishers Limited.","","Codes (symbols); Computer architecture; Fault tolerance; Probes; Quantum optics; Separation; Silicon; Systematic errors; Device fabrications; Dipole interaction; Fault tolerant operations; Fault-tolerant architectures; Impurity atoms; Orders of magnitude; Quantum Computing; Solid-state quantum computing; Qubits","EPSRC National Quantum Technology Hub; FP7/2007; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (279781); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/J015067/1, EP/K025945/1); Royal Society; European Research Council, ERC; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","Computing facilities were provided by the Oxford’s ARC service, the Imperial College High Performance Computing Service and the Dieter Jaksch group.

Recently, a significant quantum speedup was achieved in the problem of learning a hidden parity function with noise. However, if all data qubits at the query output are completely depolarized, the algorithm fails. In this work, we present a quantum parity learning algorithm that exhibits quantum advantage as long as one qubit is provided with nonzero polarization in each query. In this scenario, the quantum parity learning naturally becomes deterministic quantum computation with one qubit. Then the hidden parity function can be revealed by performing a set of operations that can be interpreted as measuring nonlocal observables on the auxiliary result qubit having nonzero polarization and each data qubit. We also discuss the source of the quantum advantage in our algorithm from the resource-theoretic point of view. © 2018 American Physical Society.","","Learning algorithms; Polarization; Quantum optics; Data qubit; Noise-Tolerant; Nonlocal; Parity functions; Quantum bits; Quantum information science; Realistic devices; Quantum computers","National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2015R1A2A2A01006251, 2016R1A5A1008184)"," We thank Sumin Lim for helpful discussions.

It can generate qubit control signals and measurement signals in real time. Compared with commercial AWG, our AWG has less latency and higher analog bandwidth. Compressing latency can reduce system feedback time, and higher analog bandwidth improves the system's integration by mounting more qubits on the readout line. The AWG integrates four high-speed digital-to-analog converters (DACs), phase-locked loop (PLL) circuits, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and related circuits into a standard PXI 3U board. The waveform generator module, communication interface module, clock module, and configuration module are realized utilizing the FPGA. The FPGA-based hardware architecture enables AWG to be flexibly configured to meet the various needs of quantum experiments. The four-channel AWG has a 2-GSa/s sampling rate, a 14-bit resolution, and 500 MHz bandwidth. The jitter in the AWG output waveform is approximately 3 ps; the latency of the AWG (the time from the feedback trigger received until a feedback pulse is generated) is approximately 55 ns.

The production of quantum chips has recently made tremendous strides, with the quantity of Qubits increasing and fidelity increasing. The smallest unit of information is the binary digit i.e. bit in general computing. In Quantum Computing the term Qubit (Quantum Bit) is used for the same purpose. In order to differentiate between a classical bit and a Qubit, Bra-Ket or Dirac notation is used. So, the Qubits are represented as |0 and 1| and are often read as Ket 0 for zero state and Ket 1 for one state.In this paper mainly programming and application sides of Quantum Computing are focused. For that, Qiskit module and its tools are used in Python programming language. General circuit optimization scheme is given.

In quantum computing (QC), classical ML models are currently being used to discriminate in-phase and quadrature (IQ) signal data to discriminate between quantum states, which is a fundamental QC operation. In our research we propose a Quantum K-Means (QK-Means) clustering technique to discriminate quantum states on the IBM Bogota quantum device, and compare its performance to the K-Means technique (its classical counterpart). We used both algorithms to perform a correlation analysis and probe cross-talk between couples of qubits on the device. We observed that QK-Means obtained test and training scores at par with the classical K-Means, and testing scores that were marginally lower than K-Means when the clusters weren't visually separable. The training times for QK-Means were observed to be at par with an implementation of the K-Means that was not optimized. In this case, we concluded a weak correlation with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.2 on the (1, 2) and (2, 3) qubit couples. After analyzing the training scores, we also conclude that the 1 qubit has the worst performance at readout evidenced by the signal data not being visually separable and the low scores obtained on both clustering algorithms compared to the other qubits. Its poor performance is further verified by the calibration data showing a high readout error of 8,4%. This technique can be used to find correlations present in readout of quantum circuits and to determine cross-talk. © 2021 IEEE.","K-Means; Machine Learning; QK-Means; Quantum Computing; Quantum Machine Learning","Correlation methods; Crosstalk; Data visualization; K-means clustering; Machine learning; Qubits; K-means; Machine-learning; Quantum Computing; Quantum K-mean; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum state; Signal data; Quantum optics","Office of Workforce Development for Teachers; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported in part by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists (WDTS) under the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship program.

We studied the performance of these methods by comparing the experimental complexity involved and the experimental fidelities obtained. We experimentally characterized several two-qubit quantum gates: identity gate, a controlled-NOT gate, and a SWAP gate. The general quantum circuit is efficient in the sense that the data needed to perform CCO-based process tomography can be directly acquired by measuring only a single qubit.

It is the basic building block of many cryptographic protocols in which it provides security over distrustful parties. This paper proposes a secured quantum two-bit commitment protocol for any two classical bits. The protocol contains two parties - a committer and a receiver - who share both quantum and classical communication channels. The main phases of this protocol are commitment and revealing phases where the concealing and binding conditions are proved in order to accept the commitment message. The proposed framework utilizes different security layers to hide specific quantum states in a superposition alongside trivial one qubit operations. The secured unitary transformations are applied by the two parties to meet the concealing and binding conditions. To verify the success of the proposed protocol, the measured output of the two parties are compared. The protocol operates under the assumption that the two parties might cheat and the possible existence of an eavesdropper.  © 2013 IEEE.","Quantum communication; quantum cryptography; quantum teleportation; quantum two-bit commitment","Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum optics; Bit commitment; Bit-commitment protocols; Condition; License; Quantum state; Quantum teleportation; Quantum two-bit commitment; Qubit; Security; Teleportation; Quantum entanglement","","","M.

In parallel to the constant research aiming at the physical implementation of quantum processors, there is another branch of research developing quantum algorithms for real-life applications, many of which need to perform arithmetic operations. As one of the most important operations, quantum addition has been adopted in Shor's algorithm, quantum linear algebra algorithms and various quantum machine learning applications. Since precision is always a non-trivial issue to determine during the computation, most-significant digit-first quantum addition can be a fundamental operation for variable precision computing. Therefore, this paper proposes the first quantum adder circuit that is able to compute from the most-significant digits, which demonstrates the advantages over the state-of-the-art quantum adders requiring carry propagation to produce results from least-significant digits. We first present a review of quantum addition circuits design, and then propose a novel method to implement quantum most-significant digit-first adders. Scalability and quantitative comparisons for different quantum full adder, quantum carry-ripple adder and quantum most-significant digit-first adder circuits have been investigated, where all circuits are implemented on IBM Qiskit SDK.  © 2021 IEEE.","","Linear algebra; Machine learning; Quantum theory; Qubits; Adder circuit; Arithmetic operations; Most significant digit first; Potential capability; Quanta computers; Quantum adders; Quantum algorithms; Quantum processors; Real-life applications; Research interests; Adders","","","J.

In this paper, we show first that the light shift imbalance by itself is actually not enough to produce such a blockade, and explain the reason by the limitation of our previous analysis had reached this constraint. We then show that by introducing Rydberg interaction, it is possible to achieve such a blockade for a wide range of parameters. Analytic arguments used to establish these results are confirmed by numerical simulations. The fidelity of coupled quantum gates based on such collective state qubits is highly insensitive to the exact number of atoms in the ensemble.

This type of logic circuit is used for the process of running the system both forward and backward.One of the main advantages of using any reversible logic is to get back the original data and to reduce the garbage output. Logic synthesis based on the Kronecker Functional Decision Diagram (KFDD) are generated for different reversible cascade methods both complemented and uncomplemented edge by using different reversible gates such as the CNOT (Controlled NOT), NOT, Toffoli gates, Peres gates, etc., and implemented in a quantum processor. In order to reduce the qubits which in turn reduces the quantum cost, it is implemented using reversible logic synthesis in KFDD method.The proposed method shows the implementation of these reversible circuits in an IBM quantum computer to find the probabilities, as it gives less quantum cost and also consumes less time when compared to other decision diagram. Reversible logic finds a wide range of applications in quantum computing and also in areas which deals with the low power design.This paper presents the implementation of KFDD using quantum circuits in IBM Quantum (IBM-Q) processor using different reversible logics and the output is discussed. © 2020 Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi.","CNOT (Controlled NOT); Decision diagram; KFDD (Kronecker functional decision diagram); Reversible circuits; Reversible gates","Computation theory; Logic circuits; Logic gates; Low power electronics; Quantum optics; Qubits; User experience; Decision diagram; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; Reversible circuits; Reversible gates; Reversible Logic; Reversible logic synthesis; Computer circuits","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-938054436-6","","","English","Proc.

The errors can be attributed to sources such as open quantum system effects and spurious interqubit couplings (crosstalk). Static ZZ coupling between qubits in transmon architectures is always present and contributes to both coherent and incoherent crosstalk errors. Its suppression is therefore a key step toward enhancing the fidelity of quantum computation using transmons. Here, we propose the use of dynamical decoupling to suppress the crosstalk and we demonstrate the success of this scheme through experiments performed on several IBM quantum cloud processors. In particular, we demonstrate improvements in quantum memory as well as the performance of single-qubit and two-qubit gate operations. We perform open quantum system simulations of the multiqubit processors and find good agreement with the experimental results. We analyze the performance of the protocol based on a simple analytical model and elucidate the importance of the qubit drive frequency in interpreting the results. In particular, we demonstrate that the XY4 dynamical decoupling sequence loses its universality if the drive frequency is not much larger than the system-bath coupling strength. Our work demonstrates that dynamical decoupling is an effective, practical, and scalable way to suppress crosstalk and open-system effects, thus paving the way toward higher-fidelity logic gates in transmon-based quantum computers.  © 2022 American Physical Society.","","Errors; Logic gates; Quantum optics; Qubits; Coherent crosstalk; Dynamical decoupling; Incoherent crosstalk; Interqubit couplings; Open quantum systems; Performance; Quantum processors; Superconducting qubits; System effects; Transmon qubit; Crosstalk","National Science Foundation, NSF, (OMA-1936388)","We thank Bibek Pokharel and Matthew Kowalsky for assistance with data-collection scripts for the IBMQE devices.

This work develops a methodology to generate shorter circuits with fewer multi-qubit gates whose unitary transformations approximate the original reference one. It explores the benefit of such generated approximations under NISQ devices. Experimental results with Grovers algorithm, multiple-control Toffoli gates, and the Transverse Field Ising Model show that such approximate circuits produce higher fidelity results than longer, theoretically precise circuits on NISQ devices, especially when the reference circuits have many CNOT gates to begin with.

As such, having a layout synthesis tool that provides high solution quality is important to maximize circuit performance and fidelity for NISQ application. Previous heuristic approaches have been shown to be far from optimal when evaluated on known-optimal benchmarks. Alternatively, exact layout synthesis tools can generate optimal results with the aid of constraint solvers but generally suffer from scalability issues because of inefficient encodings and slow optimization methods. In this paper, we propose a scalable optimal layout synthesis tool that improves upon previous works, through a more succinct problem formulation as well as better encoding techniques. Additionally, we implement a depth and SWAP count optimization feature that performs iterative refinement under a fixed time budget. Experimental results show that for depth optimization, our tool can achieve a 692× speedup over the state-of-the-art optimal layout synthesis, and for SWAP optimization, we can obtain a 6,957× speedup on average. Compared to a leading heuristic-based synthesizer, for depth optimization, we can solve circuits consisting of 54 program qubits and 1726 gates within 11 hours with an 18× depth reduction and by 12× SWAP count reduction on average. © 2023 IEEE.","","Budget control; Encoding (symbols); Heuristic methods; Integrated circuit layout; Iterative methods; Qubits; Signal encoding; % reductions; Circuit performance; Heuristics approaches; Layout synthesis; Optimal layout; Optimisations; Quantum circuit; Quantum processors; Solution quality; Synthesis tool; Optimization","National Engineering College, NEC","This work is partially supported by multiple industrial sponsors, including Amazon (under the Science Hub program) and NEC (under the CDSC industry partnership program).

The aim of our experiments in Århus is to study and utilize entanglement between strongly confined and laser-cooled 40Ca+-ions for creating quantum gates, which can serve as basic elements of a quantum computer. In our work towards realizing this goal, detection of the ions internal state is an important issue. We use the two magnetic sublevels of the 2S1/2 ground state of 40Ca+-ions trapped in a linear Paul trap as our quantum bit (qubit) states. The qubit state readout consist of two parts: First, using STlmulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) processes, the population in one of the qubit states is transferred to the long-lived non-fluorescent 2D5/2 state via the 2D3/2 state. The polarisation of the 397nm-puls is chosen so that only the population in one qubit state is transferred, while the other remains unaffected. Subsequently, by applying a laser resonant with a transition between the 2S1/2, ground state and a fluorescent excited state, the observation of fluorescence or not will lead to projection of the qubit state to the one or the other state, respectively. Our experimental progress towards internal state detection will be presented together with various perspectives. © 2005 IEEE.","","Ground state; Laser applications; Laser pulses; Light polarization; Raman scattering; Paul traps; Quantum computers; Quantum gates; STlmulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP); Quantum electronics","","","","","","","0780389735; 978-078038973-1","","","English","Eur.

On the other hand, a fundamental assumption of quantum computing is to start each computation from a register of qubits initialized in a pure state, i.e., at zero temperature. These conflicting aspects, at the interface between quantum computing and thermodynamics, are often overlooked or, at best, addressed only at a single-qubit level. In this Letter, we argue how the existence of a small but finite effective temperature, which makes the initial state a mixed state, poses a real challenge to the fidelity constraints required for the scaling of quantum computers.

Previous work demonstrated that temporal planning is an attractive approach for part of this compilation task, specifically, the routing of circuits that implement the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) applied to the MaxCut problem on a quantum processor architecture. In this paper, we extend the earlier work to route circuits that implement QAOA for Graph Coloring problems. QAOA for coloring requires execution of more, and more complex, operations on the chip, which makes routing a more challenging problem. We evaluate the approach on state-of-the-art hardware architectures from leading quantum computing companies. Additionally, we apply a planning approach to qubit initialization. Our empirical evaluation shows that temporal planning compares well to reasonable analytic upper bounds, and that solving qubit initialization with a classical planner generally helps temporal planners in finding shorter-makespan compilations for QAOA for Graph Coloring. These advances suggest that temporal planning can be an effective approach for more complex quantum computing algorithms and architectures. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.","","Computer architecture; Graph algorithms; Graph theory; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Planning; Quantum theory; Qubits; Effective approaches; Empirical evaluations; Graph coloring problem; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; Qubit initialization; Temporal planning; Artificial intelligence","","","","De Giacomo G.; Catala A.; Dilkina B.; Milano M.; Barro S.; Bugarin A.; Lang J.","IOS Press BV","09226389","978-164368100-9","","","English","Front.

Current noisy, intermediate-scale devices quantum (NISQ) devices are strongly affected by intrinsic noise that leads to a variety of computational error mechanisms. Here we assess reproducibility of NISQ computing by focusing on a specific simple error mechanism that arises during noisy readout. Using an asymmetric channel for binary readout, we develop an analytic bound on the Hellinger distance between computational outputs for different readout parameters. We validate this model using characterization and testing of the IBM toronto device, which displays a range of readout parameters. We find that to ensure reproducibility, one must avoid using register elements characterized by fidelity asymmetry exceeding a threshold. © 2021 IEEE.","Fidelity asymmetry; Hellinger distance; Quantum computing; Reproducibility","Quantum computers; VLSI circuits; Asymmetric channel; Binary readouts; Characterization and testing; Computational error; Error mechanisms; Hellinger distance; Quantum Computing; Reproducibilities; Display devices","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC, (DE-AC05-00OR22725)","This research used resources of the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, which is a DOE Office of Science User Facility supported under Contract DE-AC05-00OR22725.

It is a block cipher algorithm, in which the message is divided into blocks of 16 bits. First, keyed permutations and rotations of the message bits are used to enhance security of the scheme, where different sub-keys are used for each message block obtained according to the shared keys and the resulting ciphertext block. Second, the message is converted to quantum bits and several quantum gates are applied to them to achieve non-orthogonality of the ciphertext states to be transmitted over the optical channel. The use of non-orthogonal states ensures failure of a Trojan horse attack. The algorithm is implemented and exhaustive search for all possible system output states indicated that the proposed algorithm increases the message space and thus a brute force attack is also not possible against the proposed algorithm.","No-cloning theorem; Quantum bits (Qubits); Quantum cryptography; Trojan horse attack","Computation theory; Malware; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum electronics; Quantum theory; Security of data; Block cipher algorithms; Brute-force attack; No-cloning theorem; Non-orthogonality; Quantum bits; Quantum encryption algorithm; Symmetric key encryption algorithm; Trojan Horse attacks; Cryptography","","","","Ao S.I.; Grundfest W.S.; Douglas C.","Newswood Limited","20780958","978-988140471-8","","","English","Lect.

This process, called quantum circuit mapping, results in a gate/circuit depth overhead that depends on both the circuit properties and the hardware constraints, being the limited qubit connectivity a crucial restriction. In this paper, we propose to extend the characterization of quantum circuits by including qubit interaction graph properties using graph theory-based metrics in addition to previously used circuit-describing parameters. This approach allows for an in-depth analysis and clustering of quantum circuits and a comparison of performance when run on different quantum processors, aiding in developing better mapping techniques. Our study reveals a correlation between interaction graph-based parameters and mapping performance metrics for various existing configurations of quantum devices. We also provide a comprehensive collection of quantum circuits and algorithms for benchmarking future compilation techniques and quantum devices. © 2023, The Author(s).","Benchmarks; Compiler; Full-stack quantum computing systems; Profiling; Quantum circuit mapping; Quantum circuits","Computation theory; Electric network analysis; Mapping; Quantum optics; Qubits; Timing circuits; Benchmark; Circuit mapping; Compiler; Full-stack quantum computing system; Interaction graphs; Profiling; Quantum circuit; Quantum circuit mapping; Quantum computing systems; Graph theory","European ERDF, (PID2021-123627OB-C51); Intel Corporation; European Commission, EC; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN; Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI, (MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033)","The authors sincerely appreciate the contribution of Nikiforos Paraskevopoulos in creating the benchmark collection and its documentation, as well as scientific discussions with Prof. Eduard Alarcon (UPC).

However, the operation of large-scale quantum processors requires a shift in paradigm toward global control solutions. Here, we report a proof-of-principle demonstration of the SMART (sinusoidally modulated, always rotating, and tailored) qubit protocol. We resonantly drive a two-level system and add a tailored modulation to the dressing field to increase robustness to frequency detuning noise and microwave amplitude fluctuations. We measure a coherence time of 2 ms, corresponding to two orders of magnitude improvement compared to a bare spin, and an average Clifford gate fidelity exceeding 99%, despite the relatively long qubit gate times. We stress that the potential of this work lies in the scalability of the protocol and the relaxation of the engineering constraints for a large-scale quantum processor. This work shows that future scalable spin qubit arrays could be operated using global microwave control and local gate addressability, while increasing robustness to relevant experimental inhomogeneities.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Quantum optics; Robustness (control systems); Silicon; Control solutions; Frequency detuning; Global control; Large-scales; Noise amplitude; Packed arrays; Proof of principles; Quantum Computing; Quantum processors; Two-level system; Qubits","Sydney Quantum Academy; Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-17–1-0198); Australian National Fabrication Facility, ANFF; Australian Research Council, ARC, (CE170100012, FL190100167)","We acknowledge support from the Australian Research Council (Nos.

The challenges this technology faces, however, are substantial: for example, control of the qubit to a part in ∼104 must be accomplished with analog control pulses. But even after this is done, the accuracy is limited by the unavoidable decay of quantum information in the system. Recent experiments suggest the time over which this decay occurs is <1 μs, though it is expected to lengthen as experimental methods improve. A 1-μs decay time would mandate a very difficult to achieve maximum time of ∼100 ps per analog operation. Thus, quantum computing is, simultaneously a promising technology for solving certain very hard problems in computer science and a daunting challenge for those working to develop that technology. © 2004 IEEE.","Josephson junction qubit; Macroscopic quantum coherence; Quantum computing; Superconductive qubit","Computational complexity; Computer simulation; Error correction; LSI circuits; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Quantum theory; Relaxation processes; Superconductivity; Josephson junction qubit; Macroscopic quantum coherence; Quantum computing; Superconductive qubit; Josephson junction devices","Air Force, (F19628-00-C-002); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR","Manuscript received December 6, 2003; revised March 22, 2004.

However, because of the non-cloning property, measuring qubits in superposition forces them to collapse onto classical ones, which makes traditional run-time techniques for debugging and analyzing hardware circuits infeasible. To overcome this issue, previous works proposed the concept of quantum dynamic runtime assertion. Stabilizer is an approach adopted for correcting quantum errors. The quantum state can remain unchanged after several Pauli operations. We call these Pauli operations a stabilizer. In this work, we propose to use the quantum stabilizers for dynamic runtime assertions, which requires less quantum gates and increases the detect accuracy on Noisy intermediate scale quantum(NISQ). © 2022 SPIE.","","Program debugging; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Timing circuits; Dynamic assertions; Hardware circuits; Property; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum dynamics; Quantum error; Runtime assertion; Runtimes; Stabiliser; Quantum optics","","","Y.-R.

Secondly, the encrypted message is converted to qubits then several dynamic quantum gates are applied to them key dependently to make the ciphertext state reach the state of non-orthogonality. In consequence of the principles of quantum mechanics, the eaves cannot distinguish the non-orthogonal states of the encrypted message.

A well-known limitation to classical emulation of quantum circuits is scalability. Existing hardware emulators implement gate-based circuit models of quantum circuits that result in heavy resource utilization and degrade the scalability of the system. Also, current quantum emulation hardware use fixedpoint arithmetic, which has an adverse effect on accuracy when the system is scaled up. In this work, we employ a complexmultiply-and-accumulate (CMAC) and lookup-based emulation approach that greatly reduces resource utilization and improves system scalability in terms of number of emulated qubits. We demonstrate emulation of up to 16 fully-entangled qubits which is highest among existing work. We design fully-pipelined, highthroughput hardware architectures that use floating-point precision for higher accuracy. Experimental evaluation and analysis of the architectures in terms of speed and area is also provided.

I show how this protection can be achieved in the new class of Josephson arrays with non-trivial symmetry or topology. For such ""topologically protected"" arrays the effect of noise is exponentially small in the array size which allows one in principle to get extremely small error rates and extremely long dephasing times in these systems. In this review I present a simple physical picture of the topological protection and explain why it is related to the presence of the topological order parameter in these systems. I formulate a set of general mathematical requirements on a model that ensures the appearance of the protected degenerate states and show how these conditions can be satisfied in a simple spin model. Finally I present Josephson junction array that is described by the mathematical model which satisfy these conditions and discuss its physical properties and how one can test these predictions experimentally.","Josephson junction arrays; Protected states; Quantum computation; Qubits","Computational methods; Computer simulation; Error analysis; Error correction; Ground state; Hamiltonians; Josephson junction devices; Mathematical models; Matrix algebra; Josephson junction arrays; Protected states; Quantum computation; Quantum computers; Qubits; Quantum theory","","","","","","0277786X","","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-10444259032"

However, high-fidelity multiqubit gates pose tight requirements on individual qubit frequencies in these processors, and these constraints are difficult to satisfy when constructing larger processors due to the large dispersion in the fabrication of Josephson junctions. In this paper, we propose a mixed-integer-programming-based optimization approach that determines qubit frequencies to maximize the fabrication yield of quantum processors. We study traditional qubit and qutrit (three-level) architectures with cross-resonance interaction processors. We compare these architectures to a differential ac-Stark shift based on entanglement gates and show that our approach greatly improves the fabrication yield and also increases the scalability of these devices.

Quantum error correction has also been successfully demonstrated. This paves the way towards a scalable, error-corrected quantum computer. However, the manipulation and sensing of large-scale Qubit array with high fidelity are still facing many challenges of error management. One error mechanism is the dephasing of the coherent superposition states of Qubits, induced by the phase noise (PN) of microwave driving pulses [1]. For the X/Y axis rotation in the Bloch sphere, a phase error of 0.57° corresponds to a Qubit fidelity of 99.99% (Fig. 34.5.1) [2]. The cryogenic CMOS phase-locked loops (PLLs) in the pulse generator and reflectometry enjoy a 10sim 100times lower thermal noise, which mitigates the frequency/phase error. However, the cryogenic CMOS voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) inside the PLLs suffer from a surprisingly high flicker noise. This is due to the generation-recombination noise with varying relaxation time constant and the shifting trap density with energy. This work presents a calibration-free 12.8-to-16.5GHz cryogenic VCO on 65nm bulk CMOS process. Using an eight-shape head resonator, this VCO achieves 2nd and 3rd harmonic-resonance alignment for flicker noise suppression. Under 4.2K, a highest VCO figure-of-merit (FoM) of 202.3dBc/Hz, a temperature-invariant flicker noise corner frequency of 450sim 950textkHz and a relative bandwidth of 25.1% have been measured. © 2023 IEEE.","","Calibration; CMOS integrated circuits; Error correction; Oscillistors; Phase locked loops; Phase noise; Quantum noise; Qubits; Thermal noise; Variable frequency oscillators; Calibration free; Coherence time; Flicker noise; Large-scales; Phase error; Quanta computers; Quantum error corrections; Quantum interfaces; Qubit arrays; Voltage-controlled-oscillator; Cryogenics","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","01936530","978-166542800-2","DTPCD","","English","Dig Tech Pap IEEE Int Solid State Circuits Conf","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151624160"

The key question in distributed quantum computing using quantum networks is applying a quantum gate on qubits that are geographically separated. In this work, we propose an optimization framework to describe distributed control policies that implement a quantum circuit with gates acting on qubits located in distinct nodes. The distributed control operations throughout the quantum network can be described by a logical control plane quantum walk protocol. We then investigate the problem of assigning logical qubits in a circuit description to physical qubits in the network, with the objective of minimizing the amount of quantum control information exchanged between nodes. We present an integer programming formulation for the problem that determines both qubit assignment and network paths for the transmission of quantum control information. Our formulation restricts to circuits with 2-qubit controlled gates and highlights the difficulty of the problem in terms of complexity. Our formulation can be used to analyze the demand for network resources in terms of the number of channel uses with respect to node capacity and circuit width. © 2021 IEEE.","","Distributed parameter control systems; Logic gates; Quantum optics; Qubits; Control planes; Distributed quantum computing; Distributed-control; Optimal policies; Power; Quanta computers; Quantum network; Quantum operations; Quantum walk; Single computer; Integer programming","","","","Muller H.A.; Byrd G.; Culhane C.; Humble T.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166541691-7","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The physical size, cost, and electrical failure rate all become limiting factors in the extensibility of control systems. We have developed a series of compact RF mixing boards to address this challenge by integrating I/Q quadrature mixing, intermediate frequency/LO (local oscillator)/RF power level adjustments, and direct current bias fine tuning on a 40 × 80 mm2 four-layer printed circuit board with electromagnetic interference shielding. The RF mixing module is designed to work with RF and LO frequencies between 2.5 and 8.5 GHz. The typical image rejection and adjacent channel isolation are measured to be ∼27 dBc and ∼50 dB. By scanning the drive phase in a loopback test, the module short-term amplitude and phase linearity are typically measured to be 5 ×10−4 (Vpp/Vmean) and 1 ×10−3 radian (pk-pk). The operation of the RF mixing board was validated by integrating it into the room temperature control system of a superconducting quantum processor and executing randomized benchmarking characterization of single and two qubit gates.

The outputs generated by quantum computers that fulfill these requirements are not temporally correlated, however. In a quantum-computing device comprising solid-state qubits such as superconducting qubits, any operation to rest the qubits to their initial state faces a practical problem. We applied a statistical analysis to a collection of random numbers output from a 20-qubit superconducting-qubit cloud quantum computer using the simplest random number generation scheme. The analysis indicates temporal correlation in the output of some sequences obtained from the 20 qubits. This temporal correlation may be not related to the relaxation time of each qubit. © Y.

However, a variety of file encryption and decryption methods have been proposed. Existing file encryption/decryption technologies are under threat as hacking technologies advance, necessitating the development of stronger encryption algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we propose a modified advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm and use quantum computing to encrypt/decrypt AES image files. Because the shift is regular during the AES Shift Row procedure, the change technique led the shift to become irregular when using quantum random walk.

An algorithm utilizing symmetric key is presented, taking into account the fundamental principles of both classical and quantum computing. Messages in this algorithm consist of blocks, each of which consists of 32 bits of space. To begin with, the process of classical encryption is divided into two processes, rotation process and permutation process, all controlled by the key that determines the order in which the bits of the block message are rotated. Secondly, encrypting block messages in bits is converted to qubits. In the third step, the quantum bits are applied to a certain quantum gate, such as Not(x), Control Not (CNot) and Toffoli (T), to change the value of that quantum bits. Fourth, in order to create non-orthogonal ciphertext states, Pauli gates are utilized and controlled by a key in the second stage. Eavesdroppers cannot detect the encryption of messages that have changed from orthogonal states to non-orthogonal states because quantum computing is based on quantum mechanical principles. It has been demonstrated that the proposed algorithm increases message space. In addition, various algorithm analyses have proven the improved strength of our proposed algorithm against various attacks, including brute force attacks. © 2023 IEEE.","Pauli gates; Quantum Bits; Quantum computing; Quantum Cryptography; Quantum Gates; Toffoli Gate; Trojan Horse Attack","Logic gates; Malware; Quantum cryptography; Qubits; Non-orthogonal; Orthogonal state; Pauli gate; Quantum bit; Quantum Computing; Quantum encryption algorithm; Quantum gates; Real- time; Toffoli gates; Trojan Horse attacks; Process control","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","979-835032606-2","","","English","Int.

In this paper, we study and propose a quantum bit commitment (QBC) protocol inspired by the framework of categorical quantum mechanics. We show that our protocol is more secure and simpler than most existing cheat-sensitive QBC protocols. Then, we introduce the notion of game theoretic security, and demonstrate that such a notion is less demanding than unconditional security, yet stricter than cheat-sensitive. We show that our protocol is game theoretic secure for many commitment games. Being game theoretic secure opens the door of applying our protocol to game theory. Specifically, we show that our protocol can be used to implement equilibrium in commitment games. Finally, we run experiments on the IBM quantum computer to demonstrate the practicability of our protocol. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Categorical quantum mechanics; Commitment game; Game theoretic security; Quantum bit commitment","Computation theory; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum theory; Commitment game; Game-theoretic; Post quantum; Protocol cans; Quantum bits; Quantum Computing; Unconditional security; Game theory","","","X.

With the potential to make a large number of factorization-based encryption methods obsolete, companies and governments around the globe are racing to build the first large-scale quantum computer. Currently, most quantum computers are noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), using a relatively small collection of unreliable qubits. While error correction methods exist, they require a large number of ancilla qubits to protect the data qubits which is not practical for use on current NISQ machines. However, following the Dowling-Neven Law, available qubits on a superconducting chip are growing at an exponential rate similar to Moore's Law. Looking toward larger scale quantum machines, we examine a method to increase usable qubit density of quantum machines implementing error correction by using quantum caches that utilize simpler error correction codes. Alternatively, this also allows for the design of reliable systems while meeting the performance and qubit requirements for quantum algorithms. We modify the Qiskit quantum simulation library to work with caches and investigate the effects of region size and topology on the swap characteristics of algorithm execution. We also present our results and discuss recommended topologies for each algorithm. Lastly, we present mix scale-out simulations to examine the impact of cache on future large-scale machines. The default central cache topology gains a maximum performance increase of 2.15 times compared to the worst topology, which creates a robust cache-aware quantum processor layout.  © 2020 IEEE.","Cache Layout; Quantum Processor; Robustness","Computation theory; Cryptography; Distributed database systems; Error correction; Information theory; Integrated circuit layout; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Topology; Correction method; Encryption methods; Error correction codes; Exponential rates; Large scale quantum computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum processors; Quantum simulations; Qubits","Louisiana Board of Regent Fellowship; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1422408, 1527318, 1946626, 2020446)","VII.

Millions of training samples are fed into models with billions of parameters, which are slowly updated over hundreds of epochs. Recently, it's been shown that large, randomly initialized neural networks contain subnetworks that perform as well as fully trained models. This insight offers a promising avenue for training future neural networks by simply pruning weights from large, random models. However, this problem is combinatorically hard and classical algorithms are not efficient at finding the best subnetwork. In this paper, we explore how quantum algorithms could be formulated and applied to this neuron selection problem.

Superconducting indium micro-bumps and underbump metal (UBM) were used to join superconducting qubit chips to superconducting readout and control modules while maintaining high qubit coherence (T1, T2, echo > 20 μs) in the presence of capacitive and inductive coupling between the chips. Scanning electron microscope, X-ray, infrared and confocal microscopy were used to investigate the micro-structure, alignment accuracy, and parallelism of flip-chip qubits. The superconducting readout and control modules can accommodate both niobium and aluminum-based circuit and amplifier fabrication processes, including shadow-evaporated aluminum or Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb trilayer Josephson junctions (JJs). We present results for up to 16 active superconducting chips having trilayer junctions bonded to a passive superconducting module. The I-V characteristics and switching behavior were measured for flip-chip-connected JJ arrays with 40-20,000 JJs.

In QA hardware, each decision variable of a QUBO should be mapped to one or more adjacent qubits in such a way that pairs of variables defining a quadratic term in the objective function are mapped to some pair of adjacent qubits. However, qubits have limited connectivity in existing QA hardware. This has spurred work on preprocessing algorithms for embedding the graph representing problem variableswith quadratic terms into the hardware graph representing qubits adjacencies, such as the Chimera graph in hardware produced by D-Wave Systems. In this paper, we use integer linear programming to search for an embedding of the problem graph into certain classes of minors of the Chimera graph, which we call template embeddings. One of these classes corresponds to complete bipartite graphs, for which we show the limitation of the existing approach based on minimum odd cycle transversals (OCTs). One of the formulations presented is exact and thus can be used to certify the absence of a minor embedding using that template. On an extensive test set consisting of random graphs from five different classes of varying size and sparsity, we can embed more graphs than a state-of-the-art OCT-based approach, our approach scales better with the hardware size, and the runtime is generally orders ofmagnitude smaller. Summary of Contribution: Our work combines classical and quantum computing for operations research by showing that integer linear programming can be successfully used as a preprocessing step for adiabatic quantum optimization. We use it to determine how a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem can be solved by a quantum annealer in which the qubits are coupled as in a Chimera graph, such as in the quantum annealers currently produced by D-Wave Systems. The paper also provides a timely introduction to adiabatic quantumcomputing and related work onminor embeddings.  © 2021 INFORMS.","Adiabatic quantum computing; Chimera graph; integer linear programming; minor embedding; quadratic unconstrained binary optimization quantum annealing","Annealing; Graph algorithms; Quantum theory; Qubits; Adiabatic quantum computing; Binary optimization; Chimera graph; Embeddings; Integer Linear Programming; Minor embedding; Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization quantum annealing; Quantum annealing; Quantum Computing; Quantum optimization; Embeddings","","","T.

In addition to researchers and companies building bigger and bigger machines, these computers are already being actively connected to the internet and offered as cloud-based quantum computer services. As quantum computers become more widely accessible, potentially malicious users could try to execute their code on the machines to leak information from other users, to interfere with or manipulate results of other users, or to reverse engineer the underlying quantum computer architecture and its intellectual property, for example. To analyze such new security threats to cloud-based quantum computers, this work first proposes and explores different types of quantum computer viruses. This work shows that quantum viruses can impact outcomes of Grover's search algorithm or machine learning classification algorithms running on quantum computers, for example. The work then proposes a first of its kind quantum computer antivirus as a new means of protecting the expensive and fragile quantum computer hardware from quantum computer viruses. The antivirus can analyze quantum computer programs, also called circuits, and detect possibly malicious ones before they execute on quantum computer hardware. As a compile-time technique, it does not introduce any new overhead at run-time of the quantum computer.  © 2023 IEEE.","antivirus; quantum computer viruses; quantum computers; viruses","Computer hardware; Computer viruses; Machine learning; Anti virus; Cloud-based; Company building; Computer services; Grover's search algorithm; Quanta computers; Quantum computer architecture; Quantum computer virus; Security threats; Computer architecture","IBM Watson AI Lab; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1901901); Intel Corporation; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT; MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab","Funding text 1: ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported in part by NSF grants 1901901 and MIT–IBM Watson AI Lab.

Typically it is assumed that the links between modules are prone to noise while operations within modules have a significantly higher fidelity. To optimize fault tolerance in such architectures we introduce a hierarchical generalization of the surface code: a small ""patch"" of the code exists within each module and constitutes a single effective qubit of the logic-level surface code. Errors primarily occur in a two-dimensional subspace, i.e., patch perimeters extruded over time, and the resulting noise threshold for intermodule links can exceed ∼10% even in the absence of purification. Increasing the number of qubits within each module decreases the number of qubits necessary for encoding a logical qubit. But this advantage is relatively modest, and broadly speaking, a ""fine-grained"" network of small modules containing only about eight qubits is competitive in total qubit count versus a ""course"" network with modules containing many hundreds of qubits. © 2016 authors.","","Codes (symbols); Computation theory; Fault tolerance; Logic gates; Quantum optics; Fine grained; Hierarchical generalizations; Hierarchical surfaces; Inter-module; Logic levels; Noise thresholds; Quantum Computing; Two-dimensional subspaces; Quantum computers","EPSRC National Quantum Technology Hub in Networked Quantum Information Processing; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/J015067/1, EP/M013243/1, EP/N017188/1)","This work was supported by the EPSRC platform grant Molecular Quantum Devices (EP/J015067/1) and the EPSRC National Quantum Technology Hub in Networked Quantum Information Processing (EP/M013243/1).","","","American Physical Society","24699926","","","","English","Phys.
