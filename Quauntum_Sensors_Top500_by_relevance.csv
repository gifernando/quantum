In existing NV-based quantum sensing systems, microwave source and delivery units are implemented by a set of bulky and costly instruments. This limits its practical applications as well as portability. Here, a VCO integrated with the filtering antenna is designed, providing a more uniform, efficient, broadband and lower phase noise microwave field coupling to the NV centers. As a result, the sensitivity and the dynamic range have been improved over the conventional scheme using separate microwave components, such as antennas, transmission lines, and resonators. Moreover, in this work, the optic filter, and photodetector are also integrated using the hybrid microwave integrated circuits (HMIC) technique for the first time. This significantly increases the integration level and reduces the cost of the NV-based magnetometers. The experimental results indicate that our VCO integrated filtering antenna achieves a sensitivity of 8.52 &#x03BC;T/Hz1/2 and a dynamic range up to 32.73 dB, which are both greatly improved compared to the VCO with a single resonator. This validates the effectiveness of the approach.

The converter, which weighs less than 75 g and has a volume of only 100 cm3, is built around an ultra-low power OP-90 precision operational amplifier, which consumes less than 0.5 mA at 9 V when converting the output of a Li-Cor LI-190SA quantum sensor exposed to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 2500 μmol m-2 s-1 or only 5 μA in low light. A small 9-V battery thus powers the amplifier for more than 1000 h of continuous operation. Correlations between photometer readings and voltage output from the current-to-voltage converter were high and linear at both high and low PAR. Sixteen Li-Cor LI-190SA quantum sensors each equipped with current-to-voltage converters and connected to a miniature data logger were deployed in the upper branches of a Panamanian tropical rainforest canopy. Each unit performed reliably during a one- or two-week evaluation.","Canopy; Current-to-voltage converter; Data acquisition; Miniature data logger; Photosynthetic quantum sensor; Photosynthetically active radiation","","","","","","","","Fiore J.M., Operational Amplifiers and Linear Integrated Circuits: Theory and Application, (1992); Parker G.G., Smith A.P., Hogan K.P., Access to the upper forest canopy with a large tower crane, Bioscience, 42, pp. 664-670, (1992); Pearcy R.W., Radiation and light measurements, Plant Physiological Ecology, pp. 97-116, (1989); Pontailler J.Y., A cheap quantum sensor using a gallium arsenide photodiode, Funct.

Even though quantum radar and quantum lidar remain theoretical proposals, preliminary results suggest that these sensors have the potential of becoming disruptive technologies able to revolutionize reconnaissance systems.

The interaction between a qubit detector and the environment is described by a unitary operator, and we will assume that at most one detector does interact. The task is to determine which one does or if none do. This involves choosing an initial state of the detectors and a measurement. We consider global measurements in which all detectors are measured simultaneously. We find that an entangled initial state can improve the detection probability, but this advantage decreases as the number of detectors increases.  © 2023 American Physical Society.","","Quantum entanglement; Detection probabilities; Global measurements; Initial state; Quantum sensors; Quantum state discrimination; Sensors network; Unitary operators; Sensor networks","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (FET-2106447)","This research was supported by NSF Grant No. FET-2106447.","Eldredge Z., Foss-Feig M., Gross J.

The unique quantum mechanisms of the action of bi-electronic sensors based on tangled two-electron excitations of quantum nanoelectromechanical systems of supra-atomic scale are investigated by using of the method quantum NEMS kinetics. The main stages of detection of attosecond pulse of soft X-ray radiation by the bi-electronic sensor are presented. Physicochemistry of relaxed bi-electronic quantum sensor of supra-atomic level in the FCC crystal lattice of the 4d-transition metal is considered on example of rhodium. The data of quantum kinetics, one-particle and radial two-particle distributions of atoms inside of sensor cube Rh500 at three temperatures: T = 1, 77, 293 K is numerically investigated. It is shown that this cubic two-electron sensor can detect an attosecond radiation pulse as a result of stable distortion and by accumulation of energy corresponding to soft X-ray quanta. © 2018 Author(s).","","","","","","","","","Dowling J.P., Milburn G.J., Phil.

A fundamental question is whether a quantum sensor is capable of uniquely inferring unknown parameters in a system for a given structure of the quantum sensor and admissible measurement on the sensor. In this paper, we investigate the capability of a class of quantum sensors which consist of either a single qubit or two qubits. A quantum sensor is coupled to a spin chain system to extract information of unknown parameters in the system. With given initialization and measurement schemes, we employ the similarity transformation approach and the Gröbner basis method to prove that a single-qubit quantum sensor cannot effectively estimate the unknown parameters in the spin chain system while the two-qubit quantum sensor can. The work demonstrates that it is a feasible method to enhance the capability of quantum sensors by increasing the number of qubits in the quantum sensors for some practical applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Quantum sensing; Quantum sensor; Quantum system identification; Similarity transformation approach; Spin chain system","Parameter estimation; Qubits; Spin dynamics; High sensitivity; High-precision; Physical systems; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Quantum system identification; Similarity transformation approach; Single qubits; Spin-chain systems; Two-qubit; Quantum optics","","","","","Asian Control Association; Office of Naval Research, ONR, (FA2386-16-1-4065); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung; Office of Naval Research Global, ONRG, (N62909-19-1-2129); Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP180101805, DP190101566); Australian Camps Association, ACA","Funding text 1: His research interests include quantum control and machine learning.

In the case of active radio- frequency quantum sensors, however, there exist several practical challenges, the most significant of which is the fast and efficient generation of a large number of entangled microwave photons. In a previous paper we proposed a method, called virtual modes, for mitigating this limitation by using a distributed architecture of quantum sensor units to synthetically increase the effective number of distinguishable modes available for target detection. Although this architecture was shown to incur an increase in noise cross-contamination, we showed that judicious sensor configurations can mitigate this effect. In this paper we examine more sophisticated cross-noise statistical models that permit the number and spatial distribution of sensors to be optimized to further reduce the net detection error probability of the proposed approach. © 2018 IEEE.","","Contamination; Probability distributions; Quantum entanglement; Cross contamination; Detection error probability; Distributed architecture; Microwave photon; Quantum illuminations; Quantum sensors; Radio frequencies; Sensor configurations; Microwave sensors","","","","","","","Lanzagorta M., Quantum Radar, (2011); Lanzagorta M., Uhlmann J., Le T., Improving quantum sensing with virtual modes, Proc.

This allows one to determine the optimal use of an entangled state for quantum sensing, even in complex systems where intuition from canonical squeezing examples breaks down. In this paper we show that the maximal obtainable sensitivity using a given quantum state is determined by the largest eigenvalue of the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) and the corresponding evolution is uniquely determined by the coinciding eigenvector. Since we optimize the process of parameter encoding rather than focusing on state preparation protocols, our scheme is relevant for any quantum sensor. This procedure naturally optimizes multiparameter estimation by determining, through the eigenvectors of the QFIM, the maximal set of commuting observables with optimal sensitivity.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10797114","","","37897766","English","Phys Rev Lett","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174877430"

This is done by entangling the photons that are used as the signal states. Using entanglement, the best possible image resolution is instead given by the Heisenberg limit, an improvement proportional to the number of entangled photons in the signal. Here, we present a novel application of entanglement by inverting the above procedure. We show that the resolution obtained by an imaging system utilizing separable photons can be achieved by an imaging system making use of entangled photons, but with the advantage of a smaller aperture. This results in a smaller, lighter imaging system. Smaller imaging systems can be especially valuable in satellite imaging where weight and size play a vital role. © 2009 SPIE.","Entanglement; N00N states; Quantum interferometry; Rayleigh limit","Image resolution; Imaging systems; Interferometers; Interferometry; Optoelectronic devices; Photons; Quantum optics; Entangled photons; Entanglement; Heisenberg limit; N00N states; Novel applications; Quantum interferometry; Quantum mechanical; Quantum sensors; Rayleigh limit; Satellite imaging; Signal state; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2000); Ekert A.K., Quantum Cryptography Based on Bell's Theorem, Phys.

This approach overcomes challenges associated with structuring traditional single-crystal quantum sensing platforms and enables the creation of complex, fully three-dimensional, sensor assemblies with submicroscale resolutions (down to 400 nm) and large fields of view (>1 mm). By embedding NV center-containing nanoparticles in exemplary structures, we demonstrate high sensitivity optical sensing of temperature and magnetic fields at the microscale. Our work showcases the potential for integrating quantum sensors with advanced manufacturing techniques, facilitating the incorporation of sensors into existing microfluidic and electronic platforms, and opening new avenues for widespread utilization of quantum sensors in various applications.","2-Photon Polymerization; Nanodiamond; NV Center; ODMR; Quantum Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15306992","","","37811908","English","Nano Lett","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175270418"

In the diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre system, the qubit resonance is excited by the microwave signal, and the frequency shift is proportional to the external magnetic field strength. Conventional narrow-band antennas or single resonators are not able to match the resonance frequency of the NV centre over a wide bandwidth, resulting in degraded sensitivity and dynamic range of the sensor. Here, the authors designed a compact broadband antenna, which achieves a fractional bandwidth of 71.43% at the Zeeman splitting frequency of 2.87 GHz. With the introduced slot structure on the antenna, a higher microwave near field strength can also be achieved, which improves the magnetic field sensitivity and dynamic range. By applying our design antenna, the experimental results indicate that the NV-based quantum sensor achieves a sensitivity of 3.07 μT/Hz1/2 and a dynamic range up to 44.9 dB, which are both greatly improved compared to sensor that uses a conventional antenna. © 2022 The Authors.

Designing an instrument suite to fly on a satellite requires particular attention to a number of aspects for the instrument hardware, which are inherent to space missions. To arrive at a viable mission and spacecraft design, the science performance requirements and instrument needs have to be analyzed, drivers for the mission design need to be identified and numerical simulations of measurement performance have to be run.

Optical interferometers are used in a vast range of applications, including metrology, surface profiling, microfluidics, and mechanical stress or strain measurement and velocimetry. These instruments operate by combining two or more light sources so that interference fringe patterns are produced. Information derived from such fringe measurements is used to determine precise wavelength and to measure very small distances and thicknesses. The quantum sensor design used by the researchers at the university is a conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometer with the classical laser light source replaced with a quantum squeezed light source. The classical intensity difference counting has also been replaced with a more detailed photon counting scheme in the proposed design for conducting investigations.","","Design; Interferometers; Light sources; Quantum optics; Sensors; Stresses; Intensity difference; Interference fringe pattern; Laser light sources; Louisiana State University; Mechanical stress; Optical interferometer; Photon counting; Quantum properties; Quantum sensors; Squeezed light sources; Surface profiling; Velocimetry; Quantum theory","","","","","","","","M.

The first area we call Quantum (Data Fusion) and refers to the use of quantum computers to perform data fusion algorithms with classical data generated by quantum and classical sensors. As we discuss, we expect that these quantum fusion algorithms will have a better computational complexity than traditional fusion algorithms. This means that quantum computers could allow the efficient fusion of large data sets for complex multi-target tracking. On the other hand, (Quantum Data) Fusion refers to the fusion of quantum data that is being generated by quantum sensors. The output of the quantum sensors is considered in the form of qubits, and a quantum computer performs data fusion algorithms. Our theoretical models suggest that we expect that these algorithms can increase the sensitivity of the quantum sensor network. © 2017 SPIE.","data fusion; quantum computation; quantum data fusion; quantum information; Quantum sensing","Complex networks; Data fusion; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Sensor networks; Signal processing; Target tracking; Data fusion algorithm; Entangled networks; Fusion algorithms; Multi-target tracking; Quantum data; Quantum Information; Quantum information technologies; Quantum sensing; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2000); Lanzagorta M., Uhlmann J., Quantum Computer Science, (2008); Didomenico L.D., Lee H., Kok P., Dowling J.P., Quantum interferometric sensors, Proceedings of SPIE Quantum Sensing and Nanophotonic Devices, (2004); Dowling J.P., Quantum optical metrology-the lowdown on high-NOON states, Contemporary Physics, 49, 2, (2008); Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., MacCone L., Quantum enhanced positioning and clock synchronization, Nature, 412, (2001); Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., MacCone L., Quantum-enhanced measurements: Beating the standard quan-tum limit, Science, 306, (2004); Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., MacCone L., Quantum metrology, Phys.

DARPA's goal is to develop sensing modes which are free from the resolution limitations dictated by classical physics in which only coherent photons at the atomic level can be sensed and measured. The sensor applications of interest are lidar/radar,synthetic aperture lidar/radar, imaging cameras and passive radio frequency sensors. The objective of QSP is to develop practical sensors operating outside of a controlled laboratory environment. DARPA is planning to select one or more proposals to develop a theory and conduct an experiment in 2008 to validate the theory and in Phase II, a downselect will allow successful bidders to develop the sensor further,.","","Control equipment; Optical radar; Photons; Sensors; Synthetic aperture radar; Imaging cameras; Quantum Sensors Programme (QSP); Sensing modes; Quantum theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","02653818","","","","English","Jane's Def.

This technological paradigm-switch creates opportunities and challenges for industry, innovation and society. Several large companies, as well as start-ups, have started to develop and engineer quantum devices or begun to integrate them into their products: the commercial success of QT, together with progress in research and development, relies on certification and reliability built upon internationally agreed standards and metrological traceability. A group of European National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and Delegated Institutes (DIs) have recently created a European Metrology Network for Quantum Technologies (EMN-Q) under the auspices of EURAMET. The objective of the EMN-Q is to co-ordinate the activities of the European NMIs and Dis to ensure their efficient support for European competitiveness in quantum technologies. A special focus of the EMN-Q will be to develop new measurement capabilities and dedicated services to serve the rapidly-growing needs of industry and research institutions in this field. Industry, governmental agencies, academic sectors or any other type of stakeholder are welcome to contact the EMN-Q and discuss their metrology needs. These can relate not only to quantum characteristics of quantum devices, but also to metrology of key enabling technologies, metrology that can improve the supply chain of industrial quantum devices or other industrial needs connected with quantum technologies. EMN-Q aims to become is to become the central contact point to stakeholders interested in metrology for quantum technologies by: • contributing to standardisation & certification of quantum technologies; • promoting the take-up of metrology in the development of these technologies; • supporting industrial needs in synergy with the technological objectives of the EC Quantum Flagship and national quantum technology programs; and • promoting the use of quantum measurement techniques where advantageous for “classical” technical areas. We are in process of structuring and developing the communication services of the EMN-Q. One of the key aspect in this EMN-Q development is the establishment the EMN-Q Strategic Research Agenda (SRA). The SRA will contain the technological roadmaps that are created by the EMN-Q members in consultation with the EMN-Q Stakeholder Community. In this paper, we will provide a short overview of the EMN-Q organization, and of the SRA and the relative Technological Roadmaps. © 2021","European metrology network; Quantum metrology; Quantum technologies","European metrology network; Industry innovations; Large companies; National metrology institutes; Quantum device; Quantum metrology; Quantum technologies; Research and development; Roadmap; Strategic research agendas; Supply chains","","","","","European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research, EMPIR; Horizon 2020","This paper is based on the activities carried on in the project 19NET02 Quantum. 19NET02 Quantum has received funding from the EMPIR programme co-financed by the Participating States and from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme .","“Directive on privacy and electronic communications”, directive of the European parliament 2002/58/EC (12 July 2002), Official Journal of the European Communities, 31, 7, (2002); General data protection regulation (GDPR), see the EU GDPR website; CCTF: Report of the 19th Meeting, (2012); Riehle F., “Requirements on Time and Frequency Transfer for Frequency Standards Comparisons and for a Redefinition of the Second,” BIPM Workshop on Development of Advanced Time and Frequency Transfer Techniques, (2011); EMRP Outline Document, (2008); Coordination of the development of advanced time and frequency transfer techniques; Quantum technologies flagship (intermediate report), High-Level Steering Committee, (2017); Quantum Technologies Flagship Final Report, (2017)","I.P.

Canopy LI is often measured with linear quantum sensors, but the need for unobstructed sunlight near solar noon can make field measurements impractical. We aimed to evaluate the use of the fraction of green canopy cover (FGCC) as a surrogate for LI in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) canopies. A linear quantum sensor and a camera were used to collect 930 observations during the 2021 growing season across three locations in Kansas. Images were analyzed with the Canopeo application. The quantum sensor was also used to estimate the LI and leaf area index (LAI) in different canopy strata. Growing season shoot dry biomass was modeled with LI values from images and the quantum sensor. The LI estimated by the quantum sensor and images resulted in a strong positive linear correlation (r = 0.97). During the vegetative stages, LI values from images were generally greater than the LI values from the quantum sensor. During the reproductive stages, LI values from images were generally lower than those obtained by the quantum sensor, which was partly attributed to the better discrimination of FGCC for senescing vegetation. Using images to measure LI was easier and faster in prostrate canopies, and less sensitive to soil microrelief and changing sky conditions. The quantum sensor was useful for quantifying LI and LAI nondestructively in different canopy layers. Final growing season shoot dry biomass determined by either method was within 5% of the observed biomass. © 2022 The Authors.

For ODMR based sensing, CMOS quantum sensors seek an onchip 2.87 GHz microwave (MW) signal generator. Moreover, in order to sense smaller |\tilde{\mathrm{B}}|, these CMOS quantum sensors also require that MW signal should be swept with sufficiently small step-size near 2.87 GHz. In this work, we present a fractional-N synthesizer based 2.87 GHz MW-generator (MWG) with an extremely small programmable sweep step-size for improved sensitivity of |\tilde{\mathrm{B}}| measurements in CMOS NV magnetometry. The proposed MWG is implemented in 180 nm CMOS technology and simulations were done to validate the proposed design. Post-layout simulation results show that the proposed MWG achieves a minimum sweep-step size of 50 kHz, which can be used to sense |\tilde{\mathrm{B}}|\lt 0.9\;\mu \mathrm{T} and exhibits a phase noise of-114.5 dBc/Hz at an offset of 1 MHz near 2.87 GHz center frequency. © 2022 IEEE.","CMOS; colour-defect; diamond; magnetometry; nitrogen-vacancy; ODMR; Quantum-sensing; sensitivity","CMOS integrated circuits; Color; Diamonds; Environmental technology; Magnetic resonance; Magnetometers; Magnetometry; CMOS; CMOS technology; Color-defect; Nitrogen vacancies; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Quantum sensors; Quantum-sensing; Sensing applications; Sensitivity; Step size; Nitrogen","","","","","","","Ibrahim M.I., Foy C., Englund D.R., Han R., High-Scalability CMOS Quantum Magnetometer With Spin-State Excitation and Detection of Diamond Color Centers, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, 56, 3, pp. 1001-1014, (2021); Kim D., Ibrahim M.I., Foy C., Trusheim M.E., Han R., Englund D.R., A CMOS-Integrated Quantum Sensor Based on Nitrogen-Vacancy Centres, Nature Electron., 2, 7, pp. 284-289, (2019); Ibrahim M.I., Foy C., Englund D.R., Han R., 29. 2 A Scalable Quantum Magnetometer in 65nm CMOS with Vector-Field Detection Capability, 2019 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference-(ISSCC), pp. 458-461, (2019); Ibrahim M.I., Foy C., Kim D., Englund D.R., Han R., Room-Temperature Quantum Sensing in CMOS: On-Chip Detection of Electronic Spin States in Diamond Color Centers for Magnetometry, 2018 IEEE Symposium on VLSI Circuits, pp. 249-250, (2018); Razavi B., RF Microelectronics, (1997); Kong L., Razavi B., A 2. 4 GHz 4 mW Integer-N Inductorless RF Synthesizer, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, 51, 3, pp. 626-635, (2016); Jia S., Yan S., Wang Y., Zhang G., A Low-Power High-Speed 32/33 Prescaler Based on Novel Divide-by-4/5 Unit with Improved True Single-Phase Clock Logic, 2015 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), pp. 890-893, (2015); Rabaey J.M., Digital Integrated Circuits: A Design Perspective, (1996); Razavi B., Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits, (2001); Lin T., Ti C., Liu Y., Dynamic Current-Matching Charge Pump and Gated-Offset Linearization Technique for Delta-Sigma Fractional-N PLLs, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers, 56, 5, pp. 877-885, (2009); Srivastava A., Et al., Bio-WiTel: A Low-Power Integrated Wireless Telemetry System for Healthcare Applications in 401-406 MHz Band of MedRadio Spectrum, IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 22, 2, pp. 483-494, (2018); Kong L., Razavi B., 19. 5 A 2. 4GHz RF Fractional-N Synthesizer with 0. 25fREF BW, 2017 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), pp. 330-331, (2017); Kong L., Razavi B., A 2. 4-GHz 6. 4-mW Fractional-N Inductorless RF Synthesizer, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, 52, 8, pp. 2117-2127, (2017)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Cadence; et al.; Mediatek; Samsung; Silicon Labs; Synopsys","2022 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, ISCAS 2022","27 May 2022 through 1 June 2022","Austin","184263","02714310","978-166548485-5","PICSD","","English","Proc IEEE Int Symp Circuits Syst","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142489552"

A variety of gravity measurements have been made through the CHAMP mission, for example, that use accurate tracking of the motion of spacecraft to measure gravitational fields. Quantum gravity gradiometers based on atom interferometry have emerged as a result of the recent advent of laser cooling and manipulation of atoms. The quantum gravity gradiometer, unlike other inertial sensors, uses atoms as test masses that are unaffected by drag. The wavelike characteristic of atoms (from modern developments in the first quantization of quantum mechanics) is used to quantify local accelerations using interferometry. Cold atom-wave interferometers have previously shown outstanding sensitivity in acceleration and rotation as well, allowing for precise determination of movement in space. This will be useful in gathering information about celestial bodies' natures. The use of quantum sensors, more specifically Quantum-based Gravimeters, will lead to more accurate measurements of gravitational fields in comparison to classical sensors. This has uses in telescopes and satellites, and space probes, with the potential to increase accuracy and precision in a variety of measurements across the space industry. The increase in accuracy through the use of these sensors has been found to be up to 100,000,000 times more sensitive than classical sensors. Quantum sensors in space will be able to determine the density and seismic status and change of the global environment, climate, and bodies in space that may be of significance to space missions through the use of Quantum Interferometry. Global needs for quantum sensors consist of climate change, seismic scanning for earthquakes, and density analysis for future explorations to other planets or celestial bodies. Ways to implement such technology require optimization of fundamental parameters. © 2022 International Astronautical Federation, IAF.

Viscoelasticity is also interconnected with other biophysical properties, such as temperature, which is known to influence cellular bioenergetics. Probing the connections between intracellular temperature and cytoplasmic viscoelasticity provides an exciting opportunity for the study of biological phenomena, such as metabolism and disease progression. The small length scales and transient nature of changes in these parameters combined with their complex interdependencies pose a challenge for biosensing tools, which are often limited to a single readout modality. Here, we present a dual-mode quantum sensor capable of performing simultaneous nanoscale thermometry and rheometry in dynamic cellular environments. We use nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond nanocrystals as biocompatible sensors for in vitro measurements. We combine subdiffraction resolution single-particle tracking in a fluidic environment with optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to perform simultaneous sensing of viscoelasticity and temperature. We use our sensor to demonstrate probing of the temperature-dependent viscoelasticity in complex media at the nanoscale. We then investigate the interplay between intracellular forces and the cytoplasmic rheology in live cells. Finally, we identify different rheological regimes and reveal evidence of active trafficking and details of the nanoscale viscoelasticity of the cytoplasm.","biosensing; nanodiamond; nitrogen-vacancy center; quantum sensing; rheometry; single particle tracking; thermometry","Diamond; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Nanoparticles; Temperature; Thermometry; diamond; nanoparticle; chemistry; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; procedures; temperature; thermometry","","diamond, 7782-40-3; Diamond, ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1936086X","","","37791968","English","ACS Nano","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175269677"

There are different kinds of measuring light and these are the LUX meter, Quantum Meters, Electrical Light meter and other kinds of sensor that measures light. One of these is the Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR). Studies show that the light in forest canopies typically requires a huge quantity of light sensors. Some of these light sensors usually require huge amount of money, hence, detailed studies for this agricultural used are very expensive. This study shows the creation and testing of a practical and inexpensive sensor for measuring photo-synthetic photon flux density or PAR. Detailed instructions are provided for assembly and calibration. The sensor was made from a blue enhanced silicon photodiode held within an 8mm substrate protective casing coated with IR blocking filter. The Apogee SQ-520 Quantum Sensor was used as a standard for comparison. The stability of the VTB8440BH sensor compared favourably to Apogee SQ-420 Quantum Sensor. Based on the data gathered, the group was able to obtain the linearity of the proposed and commercially PAR sensors which has a correlation coefficient of 0.99. This means that it is close to +1, thus, it has a positive correlation coefficient.

In the quantum radar context, however, most theoretical performance analyses to date have assumed static targets. In this paper we consider the Doppler effect at the single photon level. In particular, we describe how the Doppler effect produced by clutter and moving targets modifies the quantum distinguishability and the quantum radar error detection probability equations. Furthermore, we show that Doppler-based delayline cancelers can reduce the effects of clutter in the context of quantum radar, but only in the low-brightness regime. Thus, quantum radar may prove to be an important technology if the electronic battlefield requires stealthy tracking and detection of moving targets in the presence of clutter. © 2016 SPIE.","Clutter attenuation; Doppler effect; Electronic warfare; Quantum information; Quantum radar; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Radar; Radar clutter; Radar countermeasures","Clutter (information theory); Doppler effect; Electronic warfare; Particle beams; Quantum optics; Radar; Radar clutter; Radar countermeasures; Radar equipment; Tracking radar; Detection probabilities; Distinguishability; Moving targets; Quantum Information; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Single-photon level; Theoretical performance; Radar systems","","","","","","","Lanzagorta M., Quantum Radar, (2011); Lanzagorta M., Low-brightness quantum radar, Proceedings of the SPIE Defense, Security and Sensing: Radar Sensor Technology, (2015); Lanzagorta M., Amplification of radar and lidar signatures using quantum sensors, Proc.

In turn, understanding tectonic motion provides insight to develop sophisticated models that can be used for earthquake early warning systems and for nuclear forensics. Tectonic geodesy uses the position of a network of points on the surface of earth to determine the motion of tectonic plates and the deformation of the earths crust. GPS and interferometric synthetic aperture radar are commonly used techniques used in tectonic geodesy.

This method does not require the use of artificially created magnetic fields; a scheme of an all-optical quantum sensor based on this method has been experimentally tested. The proposed method does not involve the use of radiofrequency field, since it is based on measuring the polarization properties of an oriented paramagnetic medium and does not use the phenomenon of magnetic resonance. However, the inclusion of a resonant radiofrequency field into the proposed scheme allows the information about the angle of the magnetic field vector to be supplemented with information about its module. The proposed method maintains operability and provides the same angular sensitivity of the order of tens of angular milliseconds in a wide range of magnetic fields, from hundreds of nT to hundreds of µT and above. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","magnetic field measurement; optical quantum sensor; polarization rotation","Magnetic fields; Magnetic resonance; Polarization; All optical; Angular sensitivity; Magnetic field vectors; Polarization properties; Polarization rotation; Precise measurements; Quantum sensors; Radio-frequency fields; Magnetic field measurement","","","","","","","Prouty M.D., Johnson R., Hrvoic I., Vershovskiy A.K., Optical Magnetometry, (2013); Boto E., Holmes N., Leggett J., Roberts G., Shah V., Meyer S.S., Munoz L.D., Mullinger K.J., Tierney T.M., Bestmann S., Barnes G.R., Bowtell R., Brookes M.J., Nature (London, U.K.), 555, (2018); Allred J.C., Lyman R.N., Kornack T.W., Romalis M.V., Phys.

This paper presents two methods to calculate the PPFD of daylight spectra using low cost optic sensors. The first method uses the spectral sensitivity functions of spectral sensors to recreate the quantum sensitivity curve of quantum sensors. Two sets of spectral sensitivity functions are compared. The second method calculates the PPFD based on the calculated correlated colour temperature and a spectral reconstruction using the CIE daylight model. It is demonstrated that all methods offer a useful estimation of the PPFD with correspondingly similar daylight spectra, but the supposedly simpler method, which is based on weighting of the individual channels, is more stable against deviations from the CIE daylight model. © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2022.","","Spectroscopy;

For quantum sensors, a basic capability is to uniquely infer unknown parameters in a system based on measurement data from the sensors. In this paper, we investigate the capability of a class of quantum sensors for a spin-12 chain system with unknown parameters. The sensors are composed of qubits which are coupled to the object system and can be initialized and measured. We consider the capability of the single- and two-qubit sensors and show that the capability of single-qubit quantum sensors can be enhanced by adding an extra qubit into the sensor under a certain initialization and measurement setting.

An Eppley Precision Spectral Pyranometer (PSP) was used to measure K↓ and a LICOR Li-190 quantum sensor was used to measure PAR (photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)). The mean daily PAR/K↓ ratio decreased during the hot-dry season and increased in the warm-wet season. The results show that the variation was due to trends in cloudiness and the associated atmospheric moisture associated with the movement of the Haadley cell circulation system.","","Aerosols; Atmospherics; Biomass; Clouds; Dust; Moisture; Photons; Photosynthesis; Sensors; Turbidity; Vapors; Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD); Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); Precision spectral pyranometer (PSP); Quantum sensors; Solar radiation","","","","","","","Eck T.F., Holben B.N., Ward D.E., Dubovik O., Reid J.S., Smirnov A., Mukelabai M.M., Hsu N.C., O'Neill N.T., Slutsker I., Characterization of the optical properties of biomass burning aerosols in Zambia during the 1997 ZIBBEE field campaign, J.

Within our work on compact atomic sensors, we develop miniaturized, ultra-stable optical setups for optical cooling and trapping of cold atomic gases on atom chips. Besides challenging demands on alignment precision and thermo-mechanical durability, we specifically address ultra-high vacuum (UHV) compatibility of our adhesive integration technology and the assembled optical components. A prototype of an UHV-compatible, crossed beam optical dipole trap at 1064 nm for application within a cold rubidium atomic quantum sensor currently in development at the Joint Lab Integrated Quantum Sensors at Ferdinand-Braun-Institut, Leibniz-Institut für Höchstfrequenztechnik is described. We describe the design and first qualification efforts on adhesive micro-integration technologies. These tests are conducted in application-relevant geometries and material combinations common for micro-integrated optical setups. Adhesive aging will be investigated by thermal cycling and radiation exposure. For vacuum compatibility testing, a versatile UHV testing system for samples up to 65×65mm2 footprint is currently being set up, enabling residual gas analysis, temperature cycling up to 200∘C and measurement of total gas rates down to expected 5×10-10mbarl/s at a base pressure of 10-11mbar, exceeding the common ASTM E595 test. © 2019, CEAS.","Adhesive bonding; Integrated quantum sensors; Microintegration; Microoptics; Optical dipole trap; UHV qualification","Adhesives; Atoms; C (programming language); Integration; Microoptics; Software prototyping; Ultrahigh vacuum; Adhesive bonding; Microintegration; Optical dipole traps; Quantum sensors; UHV qualification; Photonic integration technology","","","","","German Space Agency DLR; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (691156); Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi, (DLR 50WM1648-50)","This work is supported by the German Space Agency DLR with funds provided by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy under Grant numbers DLR 50WM1648-50.","Oi D.K.L., Et al., Nanosatellites for quantum science and technology, Contemp.

These sensors enable us to measure a mean photon flux density in a crop canopy, so it is possible to predict the growth and the yield of the crop. In this study, we introduced these tube light sensors, and compared distribution of the output voltage. The Variation of the continuous type was much smaller than that of the discrete type. We calculated the Standard deviation and the coefficient of Variation of the output voltage, when some light Spots shone on these sensors randomly. These values of the continuous type were about from one eighth to one ninth times as large as those of the discrete type. We indicated that the continuous type was much stable. © 1992, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

We demonstrate how to select different protocols from this family under various constraints. Focusing primarily on entanglement-based constraints, we prove the surprising result that highly entangled states are not necessary to achieve optimality in many cases. Specifically, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal protocols using at most k-partite entanglement. We prove that the protocols which satisfy these conditions use the minimum amount of entanglement possible, even when given access to arbitrary controls and ancillas. Our protocols require some amount of time-dependent control, and we show that a related class of time-independent protocols fail to achieve optimal scaling for generic functions.  © 2023 authors.

In the facility, a microcomputer controls the movement of a luminaire and a quantum sensor, and collects and records data from the sensor. To demonstrate the use of this facility, a single luminaire was tested at heights of 1. 5 and 2. 0 m. Test data were analyzed and contour plots of PPFD were produced. PPFD distributions were then calculated for 2. 0 m and 3. 0 m luminaire spacing grids with a luminaire height of 1. 5 m. The uniformity coefficient was determined and a contour plot of PPFD was made of a typical grid sector for each spacing. The 2. 0 m spacing had an average PPFD of 90. 5 mu mol s** minus **1 m** minus **2 and a uniformity coefficient of 0. 84; whereas for the 3. 0 m spacing, these values were 40. 2 and 0. 75 respectively.","","ELECTRIC LIGHTING - Photosynthesis; GREENHOUSES - Lighting; PHOTONS - Measurements; LUMINAIRES; PHOTON FLUX DENSITY DISTRIBUTION; LIGHTING FIXTURES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00012351","","TAAEA","","English","Trans ASAE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0023310866"

With an increasing number of satellites in low-Earth orbit, accurate observations of the atmospheric mass density are required to improve models of the thermosphere with applications in satellite lifetime predictions, collision risk assessment and avoidance. We are developing a compact cold atom accelerometer for atmospheric density missions, to be launched in mid to late 2020s. These quantum sensors are based on atom interferometry. A cold atom sample is generated using the combination of an atom-chip and resonant laser beams. The cold atom cloud is then diffracted using a set of three laser pulses, generating a matter-wave interferometer. The phase-shift at the output of the interferometer is proportional to the acceleration of the free falling atoms with respect to the satellite, which is converted to density observations. Teledyne e2v is producing a space suitable accelerometer physics package that can be embedded in small satellites such as a 16U cubesat or a SkimSat. It includes an atom-chip for producing magnetic fields local to the atoms in vacuum developed by RAL Space. It will address some of the engineering challenges associated with the launch and the required low SWAP and will be integrated into a breadboard system capable of acceleration measurement in order to test interferometry schemes suitable for measurements in micro-gravity. Atmospheric drag measurement can be the world's first cold atom Earth observation mission and be a pathfinder for a future large-scale cold atom gravity mission. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) sensors, which measure the photon flux density of radiation in the spectral interval from 400 to 700 nm, cannot measure the spectral components, including the photon flux density of red light band and the photon flux density of blue light band, the light in these two bands are widely used in plant lighting. Facility agriculture, especially plant factories with artificial lighting, needs these data and their ratios by far, so a type of multichannel PPFD sensor is designed to solve these problems. First, we expound the design principle, circuit, and structure of the sensor, and calibrate the unregulated sensors by a standard PPFD sensor (PQS-1, Holland) under the calibration device constructed by controller based on DMX512 protocol. The test results show that the sensor's average variance is 0.9956, which approximates the ideal linear response value 1. Meanwhile, we make a black opaque soft plastic anticrosslight sleeve using three-dimensional printing to solve the problem of crosslight on the sidewall of the filter, which let the crosslight error coefficient of the red and blue channels reduced by an order of magnitude and approached 0. Finally, we designed a set of light environment control systems, which can autocontrol the PPFD and light quality ratios, and a set of supplemental lighting systems, which can control the daily light integral, based on the sensors. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","calibration; light environment control; multichannel; photosynthetic photon flux density sensor; plant factory","3D printers; Agriculture; Artificial photosynthesis; Calibration; Lighting; Photons; Plant life extension; Quality control; Urban growth; Daily light integrals; Design and application; Facility agricultures; Light environment; Measurement of plant growths; Multichannel; Photosynthetic photon flux densities; Plant factory; Plants (botany)","","","","","Fuyang Municipal Government; Fuyang Normal University Horizontal Project; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (WK6030000084); Major Science and Technology Project of Hainan Province, (16030701093)","The article was based on the paper of the 2018 Asian Optical Conference, which has been included in the SPIE Digital Library.

This level of integration can only be obtained by a revolutionary approach to avoiding the scaling limits of conventional integrated circuits (ICs). Nanoelectronics is an emerging IC technology that will exploit quantum electronic effects in nanometer-sized heterojunction devices to enable single chip image pnxcssing systems consisting of millions of sensor-processor elements. In a quantum image processor, each sensor will be integrated with a high performance signal processor to provide a chip-Jevel throughput that approaches 1 million TeraOps. litis paper discusses the thermodynamic and other physical limits to developing monolithic, quantum sensor processors and summarizes the processor architecture, device and circuit concepts that are in development. © 1993 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

At the development and application of such automated systems, the focus is on measuring the accuracy of temperature and humidity soil, whereas to determine the level of illumination used sensors, that measure the total illumination or Photosynthetic Active Radiation (400-700 nm) with error up to 20%. Under conditions of insufficient photon flux density, even at the optimal moisture level and temperature in the greenhouse, fruiting and crop yields may not achieve high performance. This article proposes a greenhouse lighting control system in which the LI-200R Pyranometer and LI-190R-BL Quantum Sensor measure not only total illumination from the wavelength of 400–1000 nm, but also PPFD from a wavelength of 400–700 nm. Light Sensor Amplifier provides an increase in the source signal of the measuring sensors and reduces their measurement error to 1%. The applied SMART Connectivity Platform ESP8266 Version ESP 07 is more robust to interference and ensures the transfer of measured data to the server. Created software application for smartphones with Android OS, ensures remote user access to the database via the Internet for remote control and analysis of climatic indicators in the greenhouse. The proposed illumination control system in the greenhouse contributes to the improvement of precision farming. © BEIESP.","Greenhouse; Internet of Things; Light Sensor Amplifier; Quantum Light Sensor","","","","","","National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, NASU","Author I.

In this experiment we use ultracold 87Rb atoms in a differential measurement scheme for extremely precise sensing of rotations and accelerations. As a longterm goal the combination of coherent atomic sources with high resolution atom interferometry could lead to even better accuracies, especially when profiting from low-noise environments like microgravity.

Therefore, PAR observation sites are globally distributed, particularly in flux observation sites. Quantum sensors have been used for half a century to observe PAR; however, their accuracy is still uncertain. This study evaluates the accuracies of nine quantum sensor products by examining their spectral and cosine responses. On the basis of these data as well as reference spectrum data provided by our standard spectrometric measurement, we performed the following analyses: (1) a simulation of errors caused by the sensors’ non-ideal spectral response in three types of radiation inputs (open sky, forest canopy transmission, and forest canopy reflection), (2) a simulation of the errors caused by a complex combination of the sensors’ non-ideal spectral and cosine responses in three diurnal variation types of incident radiation (clear sky, partial clouds, and an overcast sky), and (3) an observation of the sensors’ long-term sensitivity degradation outdoors. Based on the results, we recommend two quantum sensors with minimal errors, LI-COR LI-190 encased in a weather-proof external housing with a glass dome and PREDE PAR-02D. The findings of this study contribute in establishing a long-term PAR observation protocol and should become a basis for quality checks and controls of PAR observation values that have previously been obtained worldwide. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cosine error; Long-term sensitivity degradation; Quantum sensor; Reference standard; Spectral error; Spectral radiation","accuracy assessment; degradation; diurnal variation; error analysis; performance assessment; photosynthesis; photosynthetically active radiation; quantitative analysis; sensitivity analysis; sensor; solar radiation; visible spectrum","","","","","","","Akitsu T., Kume A., Hirose Y., Ijima O., Nasahara K.N., On the stability of radiometric ratios of photosynthetically active radiation to global solar radiation in Tsukuba, Japan, Agric.

In nuclear medicine, powerful and highly sensitive molecular imaging modalities such as PET (Positron Emission Tomography), SPECT (Single Photon Emission CT) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) provide accurate morphological and functional information. Exploiting certain aspects of quantum mechanics may bring further improvements in sensitivity, spatial resolution and enable novel capabilities in the field of biomedical imaging and sensing. In this workshop, the possibilities of biomedical applications inspired by quantum technology were discussed. The following exciting topics were covered: quantum entanglement in PET, dynamic nuclear polarization toward more sensitive MRI, quantum sensors based on the 229mTh nuclear clock, plans of an advanced high-energy gamma-ray source at CERN, laser-assisted radiation detection, solid-state quantum sensors such as those based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond, quantum sensing using cascade multi photons, and a laser-based radioactive isotope analysis. © 2021 IEEE.","","Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical applications; Molecular imaging; Particle beams; Photons; Positron emission tomography; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Single photon emission computed tomography; Biomedical applications; Biomedical imaging; Functional information; Imaging modality; Morphological information; Quanta computers; Quantum sensors; Quantum technologies; Single photon emission CT; Spatial resolution; Nuclear medicine","","","","","Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology, PRESTO, (FY2017-2022)","This workshop is supported by PRESTO (Quantum Bioscience FY2017-2022), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).

Our approach leverages recent proposals that analyze the benefits of adopting classical machine learning to post-process quantum data in quantum sensing protocols [1]. MFL was tested at room-temperature using a setup detecting state-dependent fluorescence via confocal microscopy, and a microwave controlled NV defect in bulk diamond as a sensor [2]. This setup senses the intensity of a magnetic field B in the proximity of the quantum sensor via Ramsey interferometry [3]. In our protocol, the Ramsey precession time τ is adaptively chosen at each step via an efficient particle guess heuristic [1]. © 2019 IEEE.","","","","","","","","","Granade C., Ferrie C., Wiebe N., Cory D.G., Robust online Hamiltonian learning, New Journal of Physics, 14, 10, (2012); Santagati R., Gentile A.A., Knauer S., Schmitt S., Paesani S., Granade C., Wiebe N., Osterkamp C., McGuinness L.P., Wang J., Thompson M.G., Rarity J., Jelezko F., Laing A., Magnetic-field-learning Using A Single Electronic Spin in Diamond with One Photon-readout at Room Temperature, (2018); Bonato C., Blok M.S., Dinani H.T., Berry D.W., Markham M.L., Twitchen D.J., Hanson R., Optimized quantum sensing with a single electron spin using real-time adaptive measurements, Nat.

The diffuse component is obtained from the sky, tree, and landscape view factors. In this model, the distribution of foliage area with height and the effect of foliage clumping on both direct and diffuse radiation transmission are considered.

In the mentioned procedure, the important issue is the geomagnetic field effect on the magnetic momentum of the created radical pairs (triplet-singlet states) dancing with a special frequency. To duplicate the procedure, a quantum sensor consisting of two coincident tripartite systems is designed. Each tripartite system is independently excited with the entangled photons (signal and idler). The interesting point is that by manipulation of the system in the right condition, the microwave cavities modes separately affected by the entangled photons can be entangled. The entangled microwave photons play the same role as the triplet-singlet states present in the bird's navigational system. The key point in the design of the quantum sensor is that the entanglement between microwave photons can be strongly affected by the external magnetic field. In fact, this is the criterion employed by the quantum sensor to sense the magnetic field intensity and the direction. To analyze the system, the canonical quantization (or microscopic) method is used to determine the sensor's Hamiltonian, and also the system dynamics equations of motions are analytically derived using Heisenberg-Langevin equations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Entanglement; Quantum sensor; Quantum theory; Radical pair; Robin; Simulation","Equations of motion; Geomagnetism; Hamiltonians; Magnetic fields; Microwave sensors; Photons; Canonical quantization; Entangled photons; External magnetic field; Geomagnetic fields; Heisenberg-Langevin equations; Interesting points; Magnetic-field intensity; Navigational systems; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Ritz T., Quantum effect in biology: bird navigation, Procedia Chem., 3, pp. 262-275, (2011); Hore P., The Quantum Robin, IN-DEPTH, (2021); Arndt M., Juffmann T., Vedral V., Quantum physics meets biology, HFSP, 3, pp. 386-400, (2009); Hiscock H.G., Worster S., Kattnig D.R., Steers C., Jin Y., Manolopoulos D.E., Mouritsen H., Hore P.J., The quantum needle of the avian magnetic compass, PNAS, 113, pp. 4634-4639, (2016); Wiltschko W., Munro U., Ford H., Wiltschko R., Red light disturbs magnetic orientation of migratory birds, Nature, 364, pp. 525-527, (1993); Wiltschko W., Traudt J., Gunturkun O., Prior H., Wiltschko R., Robins have a magnetic compass in both eyes, Nature., 419, pp. 467-470, (2002); Zhang Y., Berman G.P., Kais S., Sensitivity and entanglement in the avian chemical compass, Phy.

Both downwelling and up-welling irradiances below the water surface decreased with increasing SSC, even though atmospheric downwelling increased. A relationship for PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) transmittance, reflectance, and absorption with varying levels of SSC was illustrated. -from Authors","","Atmospheric radiation; Light absorption; Radiometers; Reflectometers; Sediments; Surface waters; Water quality; remote sensing; surface reflectance; surface water quality; suspended sediment; underwater light field; Photosynthetically Active Radiation; Surface reflectance; Suspended sediment concentration; Underwater light field; Remote sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028555591"

The use of quantum technology exploits the characteristics of quantum physics. In the quantum physics realm, subatomic particles don’t follow the same set of rules as the objects we can see and touch. These differences allow new paradigms to be developed for computing and communications. Quantum computers can be used to solve previously unsolvable problems on a much larger scale. The Quantum Internet can exchange large amounts of data using quantum physics properties thereby reducing traffic on traditional communication networks.

Box 91536, Albuquerque, 87199, NM, United States","Current technology trends indicate that quantum computers are on the threshold of broad adoption and usability across many industries. At present a number of quantum computers have been realized in hardware, typically with only a few qubits and with performance limitations including short coherence times, difficult coupling to input/output processing, and strong susceptibility to noise in the ambient environment. However, the separate but closely related field of quantum sensing shows much more near-term promise in respect of its applicability to broad classes of systems and missions, including many types of aerospace systems, sensors, and the processing and evaluation of their data. This paper reviews the basic methodology and types of quantum sensing, some history of related measurements and proof-of-concept experiments, and assesses the potential applicability of quantum sensing techniques to future aerospace sensors and systems. Performance metrics using published models and demonstration experiments show distinct performance advantages in several cases and are used to compare near-term quantum sensing to more conventional systems. In addition, the application of quantum communication to networked systems is discussed, along with the potential for novel data fusion techniques using quantum-inspired protocols and methods. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

If entangled photons are used as signal states, the best possible resolution is instead given by the Heisenberg limit, an improvement proportional to the number of entangled photons in the signal. In this letter, we present a novel application of entanglement by showing that the resolution obtained by an imaging system utilizing separable photons can be achieved by an imaging system making use of entangled photons, but with the advantage of a smaller aperture, thus resulting in a smaller and lighter system. This can be especially valuable in satellite imaging where weight and size play a vital role. © 2007 IEEE.","Entanglement; N00N states; Quantum interferometry; Rayleigh limit","Image resolution; Imaging systems; Optical sensors; Photons; Satellite imagery; Entangled photons; Heisenberg limit; Quantum interferometry; Quantum sensor; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2000); Ekert A.K., Quantum cryptography based on Bell's theorem, Phys.

Recently, cryptographic quantum metrology was investigated where the information of the magnetic fields is transmitted in a secure way. However, sometimes, the positions where non-zero magnetic fields are generated could carry important information. Here, we propose an anonymous quantum sensor where an information of positions having non-zero magnetic fields is hidden after measuring magnetic fields with a quantum-sensing network. Suppose that participants are located in different positions and they have quantum sensors. After the quantum sensors are entangled, the participants implement quantum sensing that provides a phase information if non-zero magnetic fields exist, and POVM measurement is performed on quantum sensors. Importantly, even if the outcomes of the POVM measurement is stolen by an eavesdropper, information of the positions with non-zero magnetic fields is still unknown for the eavesdropper in our protocol. Here, tracelessness is guaranteed, and so our protocol is considered as anonymous. In addition, we evaluate the sensitivity of our proposed quantum sensors by using Fisher information when there are at most two positions having non-zero magnetic fields. We show that the sensitivity is finite unless these two (non-zero) magnetic fields have exactly the same amplitude. Our results pave the way for new applications of quantum-sensing network. © 2022 The Physical Society of Japan","","","","","","","MEXT Q-LEAP, (JPMJPF2014, JPMXS0118067394, JPMXS0120319794); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT; Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (JPMJPR1919); Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, CREST, (JPMJCR15N2, JPMJCR1774, JPMJMS2061)","Acknowledgements This work was supported by Leading Initiative for Excellent Young Researchers MEXT Japan and JST presto (Grant No. JPMJPR1919) Japan.

However, the mechanism for the electrical detection of NV spins is not fully understood. In this study, we observe positive contrast in photoelectrically detected magnetic resonance (PDMR) despite the usually observed negative PDMR contrast. To discuss the sign of the PDMR contrast, we numerically analyze the dynamics of photocarrier generation by NV centers using a seven-level rate model. It is found that the sign of the PDMR contrast depends on the difference in the photocurrent generated from the excited states and the metastable state of NV centers. Furthermore, we demonstrate alternating-current (AC) magnetic field sensing using spin coherence with the PDMR technique using a phase-cycling-based noise-canceling technique to suppress the noise from a fluctuating magnetic environment. We obtained the sensitivity of AC magnetic-field of ∼29nT/√Hz with the PDMR technique.  © 2023 IEEE.","Diamonds; Electron paramagnetic resonance; Photoelectricity; Quantum sensing","Electric impedance measurement; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Excited states; Magnetic fields; Paramagnetic resonance; Photoelectricity; Quantum optics; Spin dynamics; Alternating current; Electrical detection; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Photocarrier generation; Quantum information processing devices; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Resonance technique; Seven-level; Nitrogen","","","","","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (19H02546, JPMXS0118067395); Kyoto University","V.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by MEXT Q-LEAP (No. JPMXS0118067395), KAKENHI (No. 19H02546), and Kyoto University Nano Hub.

This paper introduces cold atom sensors as six-axis inertial sensors from the engineering point of view. In order to highlight the potential of this technology as needed for inertial navigation, a strapdown closed-loop-simulation has been developed. Furthermore, we present an error model for quantum sensors that includes terms such as quantum shot noise and phase noise of the reference laser. Considering this inherent stochastic characteristics, we made also a comparison with other conventional inertial measurement units. The analysis shows that quantum sensors with the same sensitivity as of for static measuring local gravity can determine their position with accuracy of one-meter level even after one hour, while other quantum sensors with less sensitivity exhibit for the same duration an amplitude up to 1 km, similar to conventional sensors. © 2017 IEEE.","","Inertial navigation systems; Interferometry; Stochastic systems; Closed-loop simulations; Cold atom interferometry; Conventional sensors; Inertial measurement unit; Inertial navigations; Mechanical sensors; Quantum technologies; Stochastic characteristic; Shot noise","","","","","Niedersächsisches Vorab","We acknowledge financial support from “Niedersächsisches Vorab” through “Fundamentals of Physics and Metrology (FPM)” initiative within the project “Quantensensorik für die Geodäsie”.","Jekeli C., Navigation error analysis of atom interferometer inertial sensor, Navigation, 52, pp. 1-14, (2005); Yang Y., Tightly Coupled MEMS INS/GPS Integration with INS Aided Receiver Tracking Loops, Calagry, (2008); Giroux R., Landry R.J., Leach B., Gourdeau R., Validation and performance evaluation of a simulink inertial navigation system simulator, Canadian Aeronautics and Space Journal, 49, pp. 149-161, (2003); Jekeli C., Inertial Navigation Systems with Geodetic Applications, (2001); Battelier B., Barrett B., Fouche L., Chichet L., Antoni-Micollier L., Porte H., Napolitano F., Lautier J., Landragin A., Bouyer P., Development of Compact Coldatom Sensors for Inertial Navigation, (2016); Gaaloul N., Hartwig J., Schubert C., Ertmer W., Rasel E.M., Precision interferometry with Bose-Einstein-Condensates, Atom Interferometry, Proceedings of International School of Physics Enrico Fermi, Bd, 188, pp. 657-689; Jekeli C., Cold atom interferometer as inertial measurement unit for precision navigation, Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Institute of Navigation, (2001); Titterton D., Weston J., Strapdown Inertial Navigation Technology Second Edition (Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics) AIAA, (2005); Canuel B., Leduc F., Holleville D., Gauguet A., Fils J., Virdis A., Clairon A., Dimarcq N., Borde C.J., Landragin A., Bouyer P., Six-Axis Inertial Sensor Using Cold-Atom Interferometry, Phys.

PPFD is one of the critically important measurements to control photosynthetic reaction of plants. Conventionally a dedicated quantum sensor is used to measure PPFD. A quantum sensor, however, can measure PPFD of a target point at once. Thus considerable cost and labor would be consumed if the quantum sensors were introduced for managing photosynthetic reaction of numerous plants in a large greenhouse for growing commercial crops. In order to solve the problem, we propose a method for measuring PPFD using a commercially available digital camera. The method estimates spectral irradiance of daylight, fluctuating hour by hour according to weather condition changes, on the basis of the color information of a reference object in an image captured by a digital camera. Then PPFD is derived from the estimated spectral irradiance. For practical use, plural reference objects are placed in a plant community and captured as an image. PPFDs at the positions of the reference objects in the captured image are simultaneously measured. We believe that proposed method is useful in real cultivation. We conducted experiments in outdoor environment. During the experiments, a Nikon digital SLR camera D300 and a white plaster ball as a reference object were used. We finally confirmed that the average error rate of PPFD measurements by this method was 2.58%, and the maximum was within 5% which is equivalent to the accuracy of the quantum sensor on the market. © 2017 ISHS.","Commercial digital camera; Image processing; Spectral irradiance","","","","","","","","Bird R.E., Riordan C., Simple solar spectral model for direct and diffuse irradiance on horizontal and tilted planes at the earth's surface for cloudless atmospheres, J.

The trapped photons are confined by the potential well, which introduce the motion of photons in a fiber Bragg grating affected by multi perturbations. The external perturbations are defined as series of nonlinear parametric in terms of potential energy. This investigation is developed by using the nonlinear couple mode equations and under Bragg resonance condition where the initial frequency of the light, ω0 is the same value as the Bragg frequency, ωB. The results show that the higher perturbation series represents the potential well is much indifferent of equilibrium. In applications, the perturbation can cause the trapped photons instability which introduces the escape photons from the potential well. The applications such as entangled photon source and quantum sensors can be performed.","","Fiber Bragg gratings; Nonlinear equations; Quantum entanglement; Bragg resonance; Couple mode equation; Entangled photons; External perturbations; Initial frequency; Multi-perturbation; Perturbation series; Quantum sensors; Photons","","","","","","","Kashyap R., Fiber Bragg Gratings, (1999); Malomed B.A., Soliton Management in Periodic Systems, (2006); Winful H.G., Marburger J.H., Garmire E., Appl.

A micro-integrated optical system (volume ∼25 mL) for trapping and manipulation of neutral atoms is presented. This setup focuses and precisely overlaps two high power laser beams (1064 nm, up to 2 W total, wR = 34 µm) launched via a single-mode, polarization maintaining optical fiber, thereby realizing a crossed beam optical dipole trap (ODT). Adhesive bonding is qualified in application relevant geometries and material systems of micro-integrated optical systems for application on mobile platforms or space. Fused silica test blocks (bond area 2 × 4 mm2) are bonded with four different adhesives on silicon wafers. Theses samples are aged by thermal cycling (up to −55 °C to 150 °C) and/or gamma-radiation (10 000 mSv) and subsequently the bond strength is evaluated by die shear testing according to MIL-STD-883L. The influence of the environmental aging on the bond strength is presented, the failure mode and the influence of fillets discussed. In addition, the effects of plasma cleaning on the bond strength in this geometry is presented. © 2023 SPIE.

To address this problem, we highlight a generalization of the sensor symmetric performance bounds of Rubio, [J. Phys. A 53, 344001 (2020)]1751-811310.1088/1751-8121/ab9d46 and develop an optimized sequential protocol for measuring such functions. We compare the performance of both approaches to one another and to local protocols that do not utilize quantum entanglement, emphasizing the geometric significance of the coefficient vectors of the measured functions in determining the best choice of measurement protocol. We show that, in many cases, especially for a large number of sensors, the optimized sequential protocol results in more accurate measurements than the other strategies. In addition, in contrast to the sensor symmetric approach, the sequential protocol is known to always be explicitly implementable. The sequential protocol is very general and has a wide range of metrological applications. © 2021 authors.

Management, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH9 3JU, Mayfield Rd., United Kingdom","Monitoring radiation interception requires frequent measurements of incoming and transmitted radiation through the canopy. When planning and setting up such an experiment, the following must be taken into consideration: type of sensor to be used, how many measurements (in space and time) to use, and the statistical reliability of the collected data. To answer these and other questions, an experiment was carried out in Scotland using containers-grown stands of three poplar clones. The transmittance data were not normally distributed. The mean and variance of hourly, daily and weekly values of transmittance, calculated using tube solarimeters or quantum sensors, were computed. The relationship between the mean and the variance, for both types of sensor, showed a good fit to the model S2 = aχ(b) (where S2 is the variance, χ is the mean, and a and b are equation parameters). The parameters of this equation have been used to determine the required sample size for the two types of sensor on the basis of the standard error of the mean. The reliability of the average transmittance does not change when considering the hourly, daily or weekly data. The standard error stabilises with 2-3 tube solarimeters and with 3-5 quantum sensors. There are high standard errors only with very high transmittance using the quantum sensors. The average seasonal ratio between the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and solar irradiance (SI) of the incoming radiation was 1.90 mmolJ-1 . With closed canopies (LAI > 2.5), the transmittance measured with tube solarimeters was as much as 4-8 times higher than that measured with quantum sensors. As a consequence, the fraction of intercepted solar irradiance was lower than the fractional PPFD interception. The seasonal average radiation conversion ratio based on PPFD and SI were 0.54 gmol-1 and 1.21 gMJ-1 respectively.","Quantum sensors; Radiation interception; Tube solarimeters","Populus berolinensis; canopy interception; poplar stand; radiation; solar irradiance","","","","","","","Arkebauer T.J., Weiss A., Sinclair T.R., Blum A., In defense of radiation use efficiency: A response to Demetriades-Shaw et al.

Existing perimeter intrusion detection schemes, if using light, rely on the classical properties of light only. Our quantum sensor network uses the quantum property of spatial superposition of photons, meaning that a photon can simultaneously follow two different paths after going through a beam splitter. Using multiple Mach–Zehnder interferometers, an entire web of paths can be generated, such that one single photon occupies them all. If an intruder violates this web in some arbitrary point, the entire photon superposition is destroyed, the photon does not self-interfere any more and this event is detected by measurements. For one single photon, the intruder detection probability is limited theoretically but can be increased arbitrarily with the usage of a sequence of photons. We show both theoretical bounds as well as practical results of the proposed schemes. The practical results are obtained by simulation experiments on IBM Quantum platforms. The benefits of our quantum approach are: low power, invisibility to potential intruders, scalability and easy practical implementation. © 2022 by the authors.","low-power sensor; perimeter intrusion detection; quantum sensor networks; quantum sensors; single photon interferometry","Intrusion detection; Light; Low power electronics; Particle beams; Photons; Simulation platform; Intrusion-Detection; Low power sensor; Perimeter detection; Perimeter intrusion detection; Quantum sensor network; Quantum sensors; Sensors network; Single Photon Interferometry; Single photons; Sensor networks","","","","","","","Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2010); Montanaro A., Quantum algorithms: An overview, npj Quantum Inf, 2, (2016); Zoo Q.A., Algebraic and Number Theoretic Algorithms; Pirandola S., Andersen U.L., Banchi L., Berta M., Bunandar D., Colbeck R., Englund D., Gehring T., Lupo C., Ottaviani C., Et al., Advances in quantum cryptography, Adv.

This technology provides a cost effective alternative for applications that demand high detector sensitivity and image quality. High Quanta sensors are fabricated on a p substrate and potentially can be back-side-thinned as well. This provides an option to camera designers to reuse the same platform for both types of sensors and easy future upgrades for end users. Cost-effective, high performance imaging detectors play a significant role in expanding the quantum efficiency of sensors and reduces the gap between back-sided-thinned and front-illuminated CCDs. Imaging dye-labeled cells using a CCD camera is an example of a scientific imaging application that can benefit from CCDs with higher quantum efficiency.","","Cameras; Charge coupled devices; Cost effectiveness; Detectors; Digital cameras; Image quality; Modernization; Optical design; Semiconductor quantum dots; Sensors; (algorithmic) complexity; (OTDR) technology; Bridging methods; Detector sensitivity; End users; High performance imaging; Illuminated CCD; Labeled cells; life sciences; OF sensors; P substrate; Scientific imaging; Quantum efficiency","","","","","","","","B.

However, their integration into compact systems is still an active area of research. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a quantum magnetometer based on negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers using a custom-designed, chip-integrated 4-way transmitter. In combination with a custom-designed microcoil array, the 4-way transmitter delivers microwave magnetic fields up to 226 μT for carrier frequencies around 7 GHz with a conversion gain of ≥32 dB to NV centers. The local oscillator (LO) signal required to drive the on-chip quadrature upconversion mixer is generated by a custom-designed quadrature PLL, which provides a 22% tuning range between 6.4 and 8 GHz, and a low phase noise of -122 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset from a 7 GHz carrier, to enable broadband, low-noise magnetometry. To verify the excellent performance of the integrated electronics, we have embedded them into a widefield diamond magnetometer using off-chip scanning optics, achieving a state-of-the-art AC-magnetic field limit of detection of 300 pT/Hz1/2. © 2023 IEEE.","NV centers; ODMR; power amplifier; quantum magnetometer; RF transmitter; SiGe BiCMOS","BiCMOS technology; Bismuth alloys; Diamonds; Magnetic fields; Magnetometers; Quantum theory; Si-Ge alloys; Calibration free; Colour centers; High sensitivity; Nitrogen-vacancy center; ODMR; Quantum magnetometer; Quantum sensors; RF transmitter; Room temperature properties; Sige BiCMOS; Power amplifiers","","","","","","","Rondin L., Et al., Magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond, Rep.

However, the challenges in fabricating photonic devices in diamond have limited its potential for use in quantum technologies. While various hybrid integration approaches have been developed for coupling diamond color centers with photonic devices defined in a heterogeneous material, these methods suffer from either large insertion loss at the material interface or evanescent light-matter coupling. Here, we present a new technique that enables the deterministic assembly of diamond color centers in a silicon nitride photonic circuit. Using this technique, we observe Purcell enhancement of silicon vacancy centers coupled to a silicon nitride ring resonator. Our hybrid integration approach has the potential for achieving the maximum possible light-matter interaction strength while maintaining low insertion loss and paves the way toward scalable manufacturing of large-scale quantum photonic circuits integrated with high-quality quantum emitters and spins.","Integrated Photonics; Quantum Optics; Solid-State Quantum Emitters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15306992","","","37782048","English","Nano Lett","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175220125"

The m-CdSe QDs were prepared using aqueous chemical synthesis method and were characterized to get insight about their structural and functional properties. The formation of m-CdSe QDs was confirmed by using Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The optical properties (absorption and emission) of m-CdSe QDs were studied as a function of cadmium salt concentration, selenide salt concentration and pH. The effect of incubation time with melamine on fluorescence of QDs was also studied in order to check the stability of quanta-sensor. The linearity range of this quanta-sensor was found to be 0.01 nM to 60 μM, with LOD of 0.013 nM. The quanta-sensor exhibited good reproducibility, selectivity and acted as a potential probe for detection of melamine in milk samples. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cadmium; Chalcogenides; Melamine; Optical probe; Quanta-sensor","Cadmium; Chalcogenides; Dairies; Fluorescence; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; II-VI semiconductors; Melamine; Optical properties; Probes; Propionic acid; Semiconductor quantum dots; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Absorption and emissions; Artificial proteins; Cadmium chalcogenides; Fluorescent labels; Functional properties; Optical probe; Reproducibilities; Salt concentration; Cadmium compounds","","","","","GATE-JRF; SERB DST; SERB-DST; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी, (GAP 0352); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India, CSIR; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge Director, CSIR-CSIO for his constant encouragement and support.

These devices can also benefit from optical fiber integration. In this work we describe experimental results supported by a theoretical model of single-beam optical pumping of 87Rb atoms within a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. The observed 50% population increase in the pumped F = 2, mF = 2 Zeeman substate along with the depopulation of remaining Zeeman substates enabled us to achieve a threefold improvement in the relative population of the mF = 2 substate within the F = 2 manifold, with 60% of the F = 2 population residing in the mF = 2 dark sublevel. Based on theoretical model, we propose methods to further improve the pumping efficiency in alkali-filled hollow-core fibers.","","","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","15394794","","","37219315","English","Opt Lett","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160015877"

Such scheme allows suppressing Stark shift components when a certain pumping light polarization is applied. As a result, long-term stability of a quantum sensor increases. However, when low-frequency (LF) and microwave fields are attached to a single vapor cell a coherence circulation in hyperfine structure of alkali atoms takes place. Physical origin of this effect is associated with the so called ""dressed"" atom theory, when atom is ""dressed"" by LF field. It yields in multiphoton absorption and resonance frequency shift. First estimates for this shift based on density matrix evolution formalism are provided in the paper. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Atoms; Magnetometers; Multiphoton processes; Pumping (laser); Hyperfine structure; Long term frequency stability; Long term stability; Multi-photon absorption; Pumping light polarization; Quantum sensors; Resonance frequency shift; Self-oscillating; Atom lasers","","","","","","","Ermak S.V., Zimnitskij P.V., Smolin R.V., Semenov V.V., Tech.

A central part of the high vacuum chamber is the maintenance of vacuum conditions. For this purpose, a prototype of a compact, i.e., miniaturized, ultrahigh vacuum pump in the form of a nonevaporable getter (NEG) pump at a wafer level (MEMS), is developed within the scope of this work. With regard to the basic conditions of the functionality of the NEG, a miniaturized heating plate with temperature sensors is analytically and numerically developed, constructed, and characterized in an ultrahigh vacuum test stand. This is followed by the integration of the NEG into the existing system, which, in connection with the characterization of material-specific parameters, enables a first correlation of heat input and pumping power. Thus, performance data of the getter-MEMS under high-vacuum confinement confirm its usability for quantum sensors. In addition, optimization potentials are shown with regard to all partial aspects of the MEMS.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Getters; Ultrahigh vacuum; Condition; Control electronics; High-vacuum chambers; Industrial use; Laser control; Laser technologies; Miniaturisation; Non-evaporable getters; Quantum sensors; Vacuum condition; Vacuum pumps","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (EXC-2123 QuantumFrontiers— 390837967)","This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschung sgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy—EXC-2123 QuantumFrontiers— 390837967.

Single photons which work as an input source are used for exciting surface plasmon polaritons at the interface between the metal and the seawater. We exploit the statistical analysis method to get the transmission spectroscopy and quantify its estimation error. Experiment results show that the detected estimation errors of the proposed quantum sensor are completely in agreement with the quantum theory. Though various external interference and experimental defects exist, the error bars are beyond the standard quantum limit. The salinity sensitivity of this proposed sensor is about 0.02204/‰. The resolution of this proposed sensor is 0.0016‰, which is one order of magnitude higher than that of traditional optical fiber surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors. The resolution and the sensitivity of the quantum sensor can be further enhanced by modifying the metal coating and the structural parameters. This work realizes the combination of optical fiber sensing technology and quantum plasmonic technology, which will pave the way for the development of high-resolution and high-sensitivity sensor. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Optical fiber; Quantum sensor; saLinity detection; Single photons; Surface plasmon polaritons","Electromagnetic wave polarization; Errors; Fiber optic sensors; Gold coatings; Optical fibers; Photons; Plasmons; Salinity measurement; Surface plasmon resonance; External interference; Hetero-core structure; High-sensitivity sensor; Optical fiber sensing technology; Standard quantum limits; Statistical analysis methods; Surface plasmon polaritons; Transmission spectroscopy; Shot noise","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61773102, 61933004); China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists; State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, SAPI, (2013ZCX09); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (N180406003)","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61773102 and 61933004 , the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant N180406003 , and State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries under Grant 2013ZCX09 . ; Funding text 2: Yong Zhao received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees, respectively, in precision instrument & automatic measurement with laser and fiber-optic techniques from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 1998 and 2001.

Designing an instrument to fly on a satellite requires particular attention to a number of aspects for the instrument hardware, which are inherent to space missions. To arrive at a viable mission and spacecraft design, the science performance requirements and instrument needs have to be analyzed, drivers for the mission design need to be identified and numerical simulations of measurement performance have to be run. This iterative process of maximizing the science return while optimizing the instrument and spacecraft designs will be illustrated with examples from a study of the fundamental physics mission STE-QUEST - comprising atom interferometry and clock comparisons - carried out at the European Space Agency. © 2015 Proceedings of the 50th Rencontres de Moriond - 2015 Gravitation: 100 years after GR.

In situ sensing of spin and charge properties under high pressure is crucially important but remains technically challenging. While the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a promising quantum sensor under extreme conditions, its spin dynamics and the quantum control of its spin states under high pressure remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrate coherent control, spin relaxation, and spin dephasing measurements for ensemble NV centers up to 32.8 GPa. With this in situ quantum sensor, we investigate the pressure-induced magnetic phase transition of a micron-size permanent magnet Nd2Fe14B sample in a diamond anvil cell, with a spatial resolution of ~2 m, and sensitivity of ~20 T/Hz1/2. This scheme could be generalized to measure other parameters such as temperature, pressure and their gradients under extreme conditions. This will be beneficial for frontier research of condensed matter physics and geophysics. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

We investigate how the number of sensors and fidelity affect sensitivity to continuous and intermittent signals. For continuous signals, we find that increasing the number of sensors by 1/F2 for F<1 always recovers the sensitivity achieved when F=1. However, when the signal is intermittent, more sensors are needed to recover the sensitivity achievable with one perfect quantum sensor. We also demonstrate the importance of near-unity control fidelity and readout at the quantum projection noise limit by estimating the frequency components of a stochastic, intermittent signal with a single trapped ion sensor. Quantum sensing has historically focused on large ensembles of sensors operated far from the standard quantum limit. The results presented in this paper show that this is insufficient for quantum sensing of intermittent signals and reemphasizes the importance of the unique scaling of quantum projection noise near an eigenstate. © 2021 American Physical Society.","","Economic and social effects; Trapped ions; Eigen state; Frequency components; Noise limit; Quantum sensors; Single trapped ion; Standard quantum limits; Stochastic signals; Trade off; Stochastic systems","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2011973, 2016245)","","Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Nat.

To accomplish this, accurate monitoring of the charge and discharge current of the battery over a wide temperature range is essential. We developed a compact diamond quantum sensor head with a size of 1 × 1 × 0.5 cm3, consisting of a (111) high-pressure and high-temperature synthesized diamond with nitrogen-vacancy centers, by electron beam irradiation, which was adhered to the top of the multimode fiber and surrounded by the microwave antenna, for EV battery monitoring. We demonstrated that our quantum sensor achieved the current measurement accuracy of 10 mA in the −150 to 150 °C temperature range with a bandwidth of 500 Hz under atmospheric pressure and confirmed that the diamond quantum sensor meets the performance requirements of EV current sensors. Moreover, the temperature dependence of shot noise and external magnetic field noise were investigated, and their relation to the linewidth and contrast of the optically detected magnetic resonance spectrum were analyzed. At high temperatures, the contrast decreased because shortening of the singlet lifetime, which accelerate the initialization. At low temperatures, the contrast was slightly decreased. This is possibly a result of increased losses due to condensation on the microwave antenna. © 2023 The Authors","Electric vehicles; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Quantum sensing; Temperature dependence","Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon fibers; Diamonds; Electric vehicles; Magnetic resonance; Nitrogen; Secondary batteries; Temperature distribution; Battery monitoring; Charge and discharge; Charge current; Discharges currents; Electric vehicle batteries; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Temperature dependence; Wide temperature operation; Electric discharges","","","","","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (0118068379, JPMXS 0118067395)","This work was supported by MEXT Quantum Leap Flagship Program (Q-LEAP) Grant Number JPMXS 0118067395 and 0118068379 .","Sanguesa J.A., Torres-Sanz V., Garrido P., Martinez F.J., Marquez-Barja J.M., A review on electric vehicles: technologies and challenges, SmartCities, 4, pp. 372-404, (2021); Hatano Y., Shin J., Tanigawa J., Shigenobu Y., Nakazono A., High-precision robust monitoring of charge / discharge current over a wide dynamic range for electric vehicle batteries using diamond quantum sensors, Sci.

In contrast, quantum radar theory states that sidelobe structures on quantum radar cross section graphs are due to quantum interference. Moreover, it is conjectured that quantum sidelobe structures may be used to detect targets oriented off the specular direction. Because of the high data bandwidth expected from quantum radar, it may be necessary to use sophisticated quantum signal analysis algorithms to determine the presence of stealth targets through the sidelobe structures. In this paper we introduce three potential quantum algorithmic techniques to compute classical and quantum radar cross sections. It is our purpose to develop a computer science-oriented tool for further physical analysis of quantum radar models as well as applications of quantum radar technology in various fields. © 2015 SPIE.","D-Wave; Quantum Annealing; Quantum Information; Quantum Radar; Quantum Sensing; Quantum Sensors; Radar Cross Sections; Stealth Sensing","Algorithms; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Radar; Radar equipment; Radar theory; Quantum annealing; Quantum Information; Quantum Sensing; Quantum sensors; Stealth Sensing; Radar cross section","","","","","Rochester Academy of Science, RAS; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT, (41594); Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, ITESM","SEVA would like to thank his family for their support as well as to gratefully acknowledge the financial support of Tecnológico de Monterrey - Escuela de Ciencias e Ingeniería, CONACyT (SNI member number 41594), and RAS project on: ""Modeling the uncertainty: quantum theory and imaging processing"", LR 7/8/2007.","Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2000); Lanzagorta M., Uhlmann J., Quantum Computer Science, (2009); Shapiro J.H., Quantum pulse compression laser radar, Proceedings of SPIE, 6603, (2007); Didomenico L.D., Lee H., Kok P., Dowling J.P., Quantum interferometric sensors, Proceedings of SPIE Quantum Sensing and Nanophotonic Devices, (2004); Dowling J.P., Quantum optical metrology - The lowdown on high-NOON states, Contemporary Physics, 49, 2, (2008); Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Quantum enhanced positioning and clock synchronization, Nature, 412, (2001); Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Quantum-enhanced measurements: Beating the standard quantum limit, Science, 306, (2004); Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Quantum metrology, Phys.

The probe magnetizes magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) accumulated in SLNs and detect the magnetic fields of magnetized MNPs. In this study, we designed a ferromagnetic core that has a unique shape and optimized the magnetic field generation system for improving the detection performance such as the magnetic sensitivity and detectable distance. The proposed magnetic core enhances an excitation magnetic field strength at a longer distance and suppresses a bias field strength at a location of the diamond quantum sensor. The increment of the excitation field is approximately 370% and the decrement of the bias field is approximately 45%. In addition to the proposed magnetic core, even applying a cancellation coil, the excitation field strength is tenfold compared with the coil only structure, suggesting the larger magnetization of MNPs generates the large magnetic field for longer detectable distance.  © 1965-2012 IEEE.","Diamond quantum sensor; magnetic cores; magnetic probe; sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)","Diamonds; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Magnetic cores; Magnetic fields; Medical applications; Probes; Detection performance; Electromagnetic coils; Ferromagnetic cores; Magnetic field generation; Magnetic field strengths; Magnetic nanoparti cles (MNPs); Magnetic sensitivity; Sentinel lymph nodes; Magnetic nanoparticles","","","","","JST CREST, (JPMJCR1333); JST PRESTO, (JPMJPR14F1, JPMJPR18G1); Futaba Electronics Memorial Foundation; Asahi Glass Foundation; Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, AMED; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (18H01470, 18H05157, JP17H01262); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Monbusho, (JPMXS0118067395)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported in part by the MEXT Quantum Leap Flagship Program (MEXT Q-LEAP) under Grant JPMXS0118067395, in part by JST CREST under Grant JPMJCR1333, in part by JST PRESTO under Grant JPMJPR14F1 and Grant JPMJPR18G1, in part by JSPS KAK-ENHI under Grant JP17H01262, Grant 18H01470, and Grant 18H05157, in part by the Asahi Glass Foundation, in part by the Futaba Foundation, and in part by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED).","Veronesi U., Et al., Distribution of axillary node metastases by level of invasion.

Quantifying intercepted PAR requires accurate measurements of total incident PAR above canopies and direct beam and diffuse PAR components. While some regional data sets include these data, e.g. from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program sites, they are not often applicable to local research sites because of the variable nature (spatial and temporal) of environmental variables that influence incoming PAR. Currently available instrumentation that measures diffuse and direct beam radiation separately can be cost prohibitive and require frequent adjustments. Alternatively, generalized empirical relationships that relate atmospheric variables and radiation components can be used but require assumptions that increase the potential for error. Our goal here was to construct and test a cheaper, highly portable instrument alternative that could be used at remote field sites to measure total, diffuse and direct beam PAR for extended time periods without supervision. The apparatus tested here uses a fabricated, solar powered rotating shadowband and other commercially available parts to collect continuous hourly PAR data. Measurements of total incident PAR had nearly a one-to-one relationship with total incident radiation measurements taken at the same research site by an unobstructed point quantum sensor. Additionally, measurements of diffuse PAR compared favorably with modeled estimates from previously published data, but displayed significant differences that were attributed to the important influence of rapidly changing local environmental conditions. The cost of the system is about 50% less than comparable commercially available systems that require periodic, but not continual adjustments.

They apply a new kind of optics based on matter waves. Today, atomic clocks are the standard for time and frequency measurement at the highest precisions. Inertial and rotational sensors using atom interferometers have already shown similar potential for replacing state-of-the-art sensors in other fields. With BoseEinstein condensates, also referred as atom lasers, the traditional experiments with atom interferometers can be greatly improved. Testing of fundamental principles, studies of atomic properties, applications as inertial sensors, and measurements of fundamental constants can benefit from the brightness (intensity and small momentum spread) of these coherent sources. In addition, the coherence properties of condensates may allow BEC-based atom interferometers to approach the Heisenberg detection limit. This corresponds to a measurement precision which scales like 1/N for N atoms and not like 1/√N as for independent measurements on N atoms. We present here the recent progress toward the acheivement of new coherent atomic sources, i.e. atom lasers, that will be use in space-based atom interferometers. We introduce new concepts of atom accelerometers and gyrometers that take advantage of the high collimation and coherence properties of atoms lasers and report on the development of a 0-g coherent atom interferometer (ICE) that will be used to test the ultimate performances of atom accelerometers in space. © 2007 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Atom interferometry; Atom laser; Bose-Einstein condensates","","","","","","","","","P.

Hence, a fabrication method for generation of V B- with superior spin properties would be desirable. In this study, we demonstrated V B- formation by two thermal treatment methods. Both methods improve the signal-to-noise ratio of optically detected magnetic resonance signal by a factor of 4. Furthermore, a zero-field splitting parameter E which reflects crystal distortion after irradiation significantly reduces for irradiation above 650 °C.

Nowadays, several systems such as optical clocks or gravitational wave detectors approach measurement sensitivities where this limitation poses a major contribution to the total statistical uncertainty. It is known that this limit can be overcome by preparing the probe in a non-classical state. We will give an overview over the different non-classical states that have been implemented in the motion of single trapped ions and discuss their individual advantages and limitations in metrology. Possible applications for the presented experiments are the measurement of small oscillating electric fields and trapping frequencies. The Focus will be on our experimental work on Fock states, where quantum-enhanced sensing in both scenarios is possible with the same quantum state. © 2021","","Electric fields; Gravity waves; Quantum noise; Quantum optics; Systematic errors; Trapped ions; Uncertainty analysis; Clock waves; Fundamental limitations; Gravitational waves detectors; Measurement sensitivity; Noise limit; Optical clocks; Quantum sensors; Single trapped ion; Statistical uncertainty; Trapped ion; Shot noise","","","","","State of Lower-Saxony; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (390837967, 434617780 – SFB 1227, B05)","We acknowledge support from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy – EXC-2123 Quantum Frontiers – 390837967 and Project-ID 434617780 – SFB 1227 (DQ-mat, project B05).

Our study suggests a similar decreasing trend in both the Pl and the ODMR contrast with increasing IR powers. The dependence of ODMR contrast on IR power is seen to be more sensitive and robust. Simultaneous NV-based temperature measurements on the NDs showed no substantial change in temperature. This further indicates that such quenching effects are not a result of the heating of the NDs.  © 2022 IEEE.","fluorescence quenching; In-frared; nanodiamonds; Nitrogen-vacancy centers; ODMR contrast","Electric fields; Fluorescence; Magnetic fields; Magnetic resonance; Nitrogen; Temperature measurement; Fluorescence quenching; In-frared; Infrared illumination; Nano scale; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Optically detected magnetic resonance contrast; Physical quantities; Power; Quantum sensors; Nanodiamonds","","","","","MHRD, MeitY; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी; Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB","We thank SERB for funding this research.

Two main obstacles prevent the extension of laser cooling techniques to a variety of atomic species and molecules. The first is associated with technical difficulties in creating cw laser light in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectral range - the absence of those laser sources prevents laser cooling of simple atoms such as hydrogen, deuterium, and antihydrogen. The second obstacle is associated with complex energy level structure of many atoms and almost all molecules - it permits decay of an excited state into a number of lower-lying states that can be widely separated in energy, which makes laser cooling of such species inefficient and experimentally very challenging. © 2019 IEEE","","Atom lasers; Atoms; Continuous wave lasers; Excited states; Molecules; Continuous-wave lasers; Energy level structures; High-precision spectroscopy; Laser cooling of atoms; Laser sources; Laser-cooling techniques; Optical frequency combs; Optical-frequency combs; Quantum sensors; Simple++; Laser cooling","","","","","","","Kielpinski D., Laser cooling of atoms and molecules with ultrafast pulses, Phys.

It has been shown that for quantum entangled interferometers that the value of quantum entanglement deteriorates in an environment with attenuation. This paper introduces a correction method that allows the quantum radar to maintain excellent performance even when dealing with an environment with attenuation. The correction method is analogous to techniques used in adaptive optics to improve images. Correction approaches based on signal sources deliberately introduced into the environment and electromagnetic sources already present in the environment are considered. Closed form expressions for estimating the range error are derived for the cases when the radar uses N entangled photons for imaging or N separate imaging photons. Simulations of radar range error estimates for entangled and separate photon cases for propagation media with widely varying attenuation properties are provided. Comparisons of estimates with and without atmospheric correction are given. The atmospheric correction method extends the range of the beneficial effects of entanglement by a factor of 82, i.e. to 5000 km for a slowly varying propagation medium. For a propagation medium with 50 times as much variation, the atmospheric correction method offers super sensitivity for three times the range of the uncorrected case. © 2009 SPIE.","Atmospheric correction; Entanglement; Heisenberg limit; Quantum imaging; Quantum metrology; Quantum radar; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Super sensitivity","Atmospherics; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Light; Light sources; Photons; Quantum optics; Radar imaging; Radar theory; Sensitivity analysis; Sensors; Separation; Atmospheric correction; Entanglement; Heisenberg limit; Quantum imaging; Quantum metrology; Quantum radar; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Super sensitivity; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., Maccone L., Quantum-enhanced measurements: Beating the standard quantum limit, Science, 306, pp. 1330-11310, (2004); Lee H., Kok P., Dowling J.P., A quantum rosetta stone for interferometry, J.

Although quantum sensors offer potentially better sensitivity than classical sensors, they are bulky and often require cooling to cryogenic temperatures or operation in vacuum. Here we propose a technical realization of a quantum sensor for magnetic field detection based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, which is compatible with miniaturization and offers potential sub-picotesla sensitivity. The miniaturization is based on recently developed electric readout of the NV center electron spin resonance. Our engineering platform allows to use diamond chip as a portable magnetic field sensor. We have designed and tested a miniaturized prototype and describe all key components for technical miniaturization. We achieved a power consumption down to 3.5 W, a weight of the fully integrated sensor of only 27g and small dimensions of 45 x 25 x 25 mm including all driving and readout components. We have proved the chip functionality in vacuum and explored its thermal behavior. The system will be further used for on-board stratospheric balloon experiment. The miniaturized sensor we developed has potential applications in a wide range of fields including navigation, bio-signal measurement, material analysis or space weather monitoring and planetary observation.

Osbeck) were measured in the field during the growing season of 1977/78 to ascertain if, as in the leaf, stomata control photosynthesis and transpiration under changing environmental conditions. Measurements were made on 15 year old trees grown in a sandy loam soil and receiving either a dry or a wet treatment. Fruit diffusive conductance was measured with a modified water vapour diffusion conductance meter and gross photosynthesis was measured with a 14CO2 uptake meter. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was measured with a quantum sensor. Fruits exposed to light assimilated CO2 at a rate which was 25-50% of that assimilated by leaves. The uptake was dependent on fruit size, PAR, chlorophyll content, and on diffusive conductance of the fruit epidermis. Epidermal conductance showed a diurnal trend which was similar in shape to that of the leaf except in the late afternoon. Cuticular conductance of the fruit was calculated and ranged between 0.22 and 0.30 mm s-1. It was speculated that the CO2 uptake by the fruit could support the growth of flavedo cell layers when exposed to light. Dry soil caused an increase in the 14CO2 uptake by fruit possibly caused by the increased potential area of the stomatal opening per unit of fruit surface area. © 1980 Oxford University Press.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00220957","","JEBOA","","English","J.

In a field trial of the sensors conducted simultaneously at 10 sites, we characterized variation at a range of spatial scales and found a peak in the variance between 1-m plots within a site.","Amplifier circuit; Heterogeneity; Light sensor; Measurement; Photosynthetically active radiation; Streams","light intensity; sensor; spatiotemporal analysis; stream","","","","","","","Biggs W.W., Edison A.R., Eastin J.D., Brown K.W., Maranville J.W., Clegg M.D., Photosynthesis light sensor and meter, Ecology, 52, pp. 125-131, (1971); Chazdon R.L., Fetcher N., Photosynthetic light environments in a lowland tropical rain forest in Costa Rica, Journal of Ecology, 72, pp. 553-564, (1984); Cooper S.D., Barmuta L., Sarnelle O., Kratz K., Diehl S., Quantifying spatial heterogeneity in streams, Journal of the North American Benthological Society, 16, pp. 174-188, (1997); Dawson F.H., An inexpensive photosynthetic irradiance sensor for ecological field studies, Hydrobiologia, 77, pp. 71-76, (1981); Feminella J.W., Power M.E., Resh V.H., Periphyton responses to invertebrate grazing and riparian canopy in three northern California coastal streams, Freshwater Biology, 22, pp. 445-457, (1989); Gutschick V.P., Barron M.H., Waechter D.A., Wolf M.A., Portable monitor for solar radiation that accumulates irradiance histograms for 32 leaf-mounted sensors, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 33, pp. 281-290, (1985); Hill W., Effects of light, Algal Ecology: Freshwater Benthic Ecosystems, pp. 121-148, (1996); Hill W.R., Ryon M.G., Schilling E.M., Light limitation in a stream ecosystem: Responses by primary producers and consumers, Ecology, 76, pp. 1297-1309, (1995); Johnson N.L., Kotz S., Balakrishnan N., Continuous Univariate Distributions. 2nd Edition, (1994); Payne R.W., The Guide to Genstat.

One of the fundamental questions hardly known is how quantum computing research is developing to support scientific advances and the evolution of path-breaking technologies for economic, industrial, and social change. This study confronts the question here by applying methods of computational scientometrics for publication analyses to explain the structure and evolution of quantum computing research and technologies over a 30-year period. Results reveal that the evolution of quantum computing from 1990 to 2020 has a considerable average increase of connectivity in the network (growth of degree centrality measure), a moderate increase of the average influence of nodes on the flow between nodes (little growth of betweenness centrality measure), and a little reduction of the easiest access of each node to all other nodes (closeness centrality measure). This evolutionary dynamics is due to the increase in size and complexity of the network in quantum computing research over time. This study also suggests that the network of quantum computing has a transition from hardware to software research that supports accelerated evolution of technological pathways in quantum image processing, quantum machine learning, and quantum sensors. Theoretical implications of this study show the morphological evolution of the network in quantum computing from a symmetric to an asymmetric shape driven by new inter-related research fields and emerging technological trajectories. Findings here suggest best practices of innovation management based on R&amp;D investments in new technological directions of quantum computing having a high potential for growth and impact in science and markets.

Light intensity distribution on the canopy surface was estimated as a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) histogram using reflection images. Reflection images of the tomato canopy surface were acquired from three different directions using a digital camera through a blue-green band-pass filter. PPFD was measured at one point on the canopy by a quantum sensor simultaneously with imaging and was used for determining a regression model for calculating PPFD on leaves from image pixel values. The PPFD histograms estimated from the reflection images were compared with the histograms of actual PPFD determined by measuring all leaves in the target canopy surface using a quantum sensor. The histograms showed similar patterns, with the mean estimated values being close to the measured values. The pattern of the PPFD histograms estimated from the reflection images changed over time during the day. The changes in the mean values calculated from the estimated PPFD histograms corresponded to those in PPFD measured on the horizontal plane. These results suggest that reflection image-based estimation of PPFD distribution on a plant canopy surface can be used for simple evaluation of the light environment in a greenhouse. © ISHS 2012.","Digital camera; Light control; Light intensity distribution; Reflection image; Tomato canopy","","","","","","","","Atkinson C.J., Dodds P.A.A., Ford Y.Y., Miere J.L., Taylor J.M., Blake P.S., Paul N., Effects of cultivar, fruit number and reflected photosynthetically active radiation on Fragaria × ananassa productivity and fruit ellagic acid and ascorbic acid concentrations, Ann.

A derivation of the closed form expression for the detection operator that is optimal subject to constraints is provided. The raising and lowering properties of the detection operator and its square are developed. The expectations of the optimal detection operator and its square are derived. The expression for the visibility, the maximum expectation of the optimal detection operator, is developed. From the expectation of the square of the detection operator and the visibility, the phase error and the minimum phase error for the detection operator are derived. The optimal resolution for the maximum visibility and minimum phase error are found. For the visibility, comparisons between PMMSs, LCMMS and N00N states are provided. For the minimum phase error comparisons between LCMMS, PMMSs, N00N states, separate photon states (SPSs), the shot noise limit (SNL), and the Heisenberg limit (HL) are provided. A representative collection of computational results illustrating the superiority of LCMMS when compared to PMMSs and N00N states is given. It is found for a resolution 12 times the classical result LCMMS has visibility 11 times that of N00N states and four times that of PMMSs. For the same case, the minimum phase error for LCMMS is 10.7 times smaller than that of PMMS and 29.7 times smaller than that of N00N states. © 2010 SPIE.","M and M states; N00N states; Quantum entanglement; Quantum imaging; Quantum interferometer; Quantum metrology; Quantum radar; Quantum sensors; Super resolution; Super sensitivity","Error detection; Interferometers; Optimization; Quantum optics; Radar; Radar imaging; Radar theory; Sensors; Visibility; Quantum imaging; Quantum interferometer; Quantum metrology; Quantum radar; Quantum sensors; Super resolution; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Giovannetti V., Lloyd S., MacCone L., Quantum-enhanced measurements: Beating the standard quantum limit, Science, 306, pp. 1330-11310, (2004); Lee H., Kok P., Dowling J.P., A quantum rosetta stone for interferometry, J.

Individual defect centers in diamond were used to detect individual nuclear spins with a nanometer scale resolution, and ensemble magnetometers rival SQUID and vapor cell magnetometers when taking into account room-temperature operation and size. NV center spins can also detect electric field vectors, despite their weak coupling to electric fields. Here, we employ ensembles of NV center spins to measure macroscopic AC electric fields with high precision. We utilize low strain, 12C enriched diamond to achieve the maximum sensitivity and tailor the spin Hamiltonian via the proper magnetic field adjustment to map out the AC electric field strength and polarization and arrive at refined electric field coupling constants. For high-precision measurements, we combine classical lock-in detection with aspects from quantum phase estimation for the effective suppression of technical noise. Eventually, this enables t-1/2 uncertainty scaling of the electric field strength over extended averaging periods, enabling us to reach a precision down to 10-7 V/μm for an AC electric field with a frequency of 2 kHz and an amplitude of 0.012 V/ μm. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","diamond; electric-field measurement; high-precision measurement; NV center; quantum sensor","Diamonds; Electric field effects; Electrospinning; Hamiltonians; Magnetometers; Quantum theory; Spin dynamics; Electric field strength; Electric-field coupling; High-precision measurement; Nanometer-scale resolution; NV center; Quantum phase estimation; Quantum sensors; Room-temperature operation; Electric field measurement","","","","","Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (742610, 820394); European Commission, EC, (765267); European Research Council, ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (SPP 1601); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (17H02751); Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, MPG","We want to thank Ingmar Jakobi and Tetyana Shalomayeva for their support with the experiments.

A potentially impactful application, namely the detection of time-varying signals in noise or clutter, is a crucial component for advanced radar detection systems and surveillance networks. This particular application was recently introduced in a quantum context, along with optimal control protocols to minimize the detection error rates. Here, we experimentally execute this quantum signal detection protocol and show that it remains effective when applied to real-world communications signals that do not meet the assumptions of the original formulation of the protocol, due to their non-Gaussian nature. We also consider another class of signals motivated by pulsed radar, which presents challenges for the quantum signal detection protocol due to their intermittent nature. Despite this, we demonstrate that additional classical processing of the quantum observations may be used to determine the presence of the signal. These results further extend the potential of quantum sensing techniques to operationally relevant, quantum-enhanced receive chains in passive or bistatic sensing scenarios. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Light sampling schemes are evaluated for a 2-year-old, plant density study with jack pine (Pillus banksiana Lamb.), large-leaved aster (Aster macrophyllus L.), and wild red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L. var. strigosus (Michx.) Maxim.). The model simulates PAR transmission through a plant canopy using two modules: a radiation module that simulates direct and diffuse components of global PAR and a distant-dependent vegetation module that simulates light interception by individual plants. Calibration and testing of the model using vegetation measurements and a subset of PAR data from the field study revealed that model predictions agreed closely with observed PAR measurements. Means and the standard deviations for prediction errors were -0.17% and 6.38% for aster, and 2.02% and 6.41% for raspberry, respectively. Using the model, we found that (1) positioning a line quantum sensor in diagonal positions on I x I m subplots underestimated average PAR transmission under aster and raspberry by 6.25% and 6.47%, respectively, at the ground level, and 7.47% and 6.91%, respectively, at the crown level; (2) there was no difference in predicted PAR transmission at the ground and crown levels between systematic and random arrangements of aster and raspberry plants in the density study; (3) instantaneous PAR transmission throughout the day under a clear sky was highly correlated with the daily average; and (4) the amplitude and standard deviation of predicted PAR transmission were relatively stable for sampling windows that spanned nearly the entire daylight period. Using this approach, we demonstrate how mechanistic models can be used to evaluate alternative experimental and sampling designs in field studies.","","Aster macrophyllus; Asteraceae; Pinaceae; Pinus banksiana; Rosaceae; Rubus idaeus strigosus; jack pine; large-leaved aster; light; photosynthetically active radiation; red raspberry; sampling","","","","","","","","","","Canadian Science Publishing","","","","","","00455067","","CJFRA","","English","CAN.

In this work, the H/O/OH mixed terminations on hexagonal diamond (100) surfaces to host NV centers are investigated by first-principles calculations. Results indicate that H–O, O–OH, and H–O–OH mixed surfaces produce positive electron affinity with neither spin noise nor surface-related state. It is concluded that the surface-connected ether bonds should be maintained, and unconnected ether bonds should be avoided, preserving the shallow NV centers unaffected. Based on the surface stability analysis, we further confirm that the H–O surface has a higher possibility to be fabricated. Moreover, we make an intensive study by placing an NV center ∼12 Å from the hexagonal (100) surface, and the results elucidate that the H–O surface has no obvious effect on the defect states of the NV center. Therefore, we identify a combination of surface terminators that is a prospective candidate for NV-based quantum sensors. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","","Diamonds; Electron affinity; Ethers; Hydrogen; Oxygen; Diamond surfaces; Ether bond; First principle calculations; Hexagonal diamond; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Positive electron affinities; Quantum sensors; Sensing applications; Spin noise; Nitrogen","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Jilin Province, (YDZJ202201ZYTS650)","This work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Jilin Province (Grant No. YDZJ202201ZYTS650 ).

However, the small volume available for the systems and the short distances from the LED array necessary in these applications create several unique problems. The discrete LEDS are small and the spacing between the lamps results in significant irradiance variation on surfaces near the array. These irradiance variations make it difficult to use traditional hand-held sensors to measure light levels under the array accurately. The usefulness of rear projection video camera imaging is investigated for the analysis of uniformity of irradiance from an LED array. Irradiance measurements were taken at a high mounting height from the array using both a 400-700-nm quantum sensor and a video camera. Additionally, video images were recorded at different mounting heights from the array. The rear projection imaging technique was suitable for analyzing the irradiance from LED arrays. Comparison of the readings from the video image and the sensor suggests that there is a nonlinear relationship between video image reading and sensor value (R(2) = 0.884). These data also show that the average photosynthetically active radiation level (PAR) does not change as mounting height varies, but that the spatial uniformity of the PAR does increase as mounting height increases. These results are consistent with geometrical analyses of the system.","","Ecological Systems, Closed; Evaluation Studies; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Life Support Systems; Light; Lighting; Photons; Photosynthesis; Plants; Video Recording; NASA Discipline Life Support Systems; Non-NASA Center; article; comparative study; evaluation; growth, development and aging; illumination; image processing; instrumentation; light; microclimate; NASA Discipline Life Support Systems; Non-NASA Center; photon; photosynthesis; plant; radiation exposure; videorecording","","","","","","","","D.E.

A low-coherence electron source results in a drop of fringe contrast. One approach to enhance a visibility of the diffraction pattern is to improve a longitudinal coherence of an electron beam. When electrons pass through a magnetic field, they experience a force which bends them to circular paths. Electrons with different energies will travel along the different paths. By placing a slit behind the magnetic field, the width of the electron energy distribution will become narrower and hence an improvement of the beam coherence. However, this method reduces the intensity of the electron beam. The simulation was performed to optimize the slit width for electron diffraction experiments with respect to the energy spread of the beam and electron flux. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Beryllium compounds; Electron beams; Electron diffraction; Electron energy levels; Magnetic fields; Visibility; Beam coherence; Circular paths; Electron energy distributions; Energy spreads; Fringe contrasts; Fundamental physics; Low-coherence; Quantum sensors; Electrons","","","","","Faculty of Science, Maejo University, (3/2561)","This work was financially supported by Faculty of Science, Burapha University (contract no 3/2561).","Davisson C., Germer L.H., Phys.

In this paper we propose an entanglement assisted (EA) joint monostatic-bistatic quantum radar scheme, which significantly outperforms corresponding conventional ra-dars. The proposed joint monostatic-bistatic quantum radar is composed of two radars, one having both wideband entangled source and EA detector, and the second one with only an EA detector. The optical phase conjugation (OPC) is applied on the transmitter side, while classical coherent detection schemes are applied in both receivers. The joint monostatic-bistatic integrated EA transmitter is proposed suitable for implementation in LiNbO3 technology. The detection probability of the proposed EA joint target detection scheme outperforms significantly corresponding classical, coherent states-based quantum detection, and EA monostatic detection schemes. The proposed EA joint target detection scheme is evaluated by modelling the direct radar return and forward scattering channels as both lossy and noisy Bosonic channels, and assuming that the distribution of entanglement over idler channels is not perfect.

This paper presents a Gaussian quantum states-based quantum sensing paradigm. Gaussian quantum states have the advantage of being relatively easy to generate and manipulate in practice, and they can be used for realizing quantum sensors in the near term. Squeezed quantum states which are an example of Gaussian quantum states can improve the estimation accuracy by reducing the quantum shot noise in one of the quadratures. We present two prototypical examples of Gaussian states-based quantum sensing applications, including quadrature estimation and channel transmittance estimation of a lossy bosonic Gaussian channel. We show that improved estimation can be achieved for both problems by using squeezed states compared to classical coherent states.  © 2023 IEEE.","bosonic Gaussian channel; Gaussian quantum states; quantum metrology; quantum parameter estimation; Quantum sensors","Bosons; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Quantum optics; Shot noise; Bosonic gaussian channel; Gaussian channels; Gaussian quantum state; Of quantum-information; Parameters estimation; Quantum metrology; Quantum parameter estimation; Quantum parameters; Quantum sensors; State based; Parameter estimation","","","","","Australian Government; Australian Research Council, ARC, (FT200100928)","Matthew R.

In this work, six types of terminated hexagonal diamond (100) surfaces for shallow NV centers are proposed, and structural and electronic properties are investigated by structure prediction method combined with first-principles calculation. In these structures, only fluorine and oxygen terminated surfaces (F-hex and α-O-hex) have positive electron affinity of 3.00 and 2.85 eV, respectively, no surface-related states and electron spin noise, indicating that the F-hex and α-O-hex surfaces could be a promising host of NV center. We make further inspections by placing an NV center ∼12 Å below the surfaces, and the results confirm that the surfaces have little effect on the defect states of NV center. Consequently, the F-hex and α-O-hex surfaces are prospective candidates for NV-based quantum sensors. © 2023","","Diamonds; Electron affinity; Electronic properties; Fluorine; Magnetic moments; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Diamond surfaces; First principle calculations; Hexagonal diamond; Negatively charged; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Prediction methods; Quantum sensors; Structural and electronic properties; Structure prediction; Chemical modification","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Jilin Province, (YDZJ202301ZYTS274)","This work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Jilin Province (Grant No. YDZJ202301ZYTS274 ).

Sci. 218, United States","Local photosynthetic photon flux fluence rate (PPFFR) determined by a submersible 4π quantum micro-sensor was used in developing a versatile on-line state estimator for stirred-tank microalgal photobioreactor cultures. A marine micro-alga Dunaliella salina was used as a model organism in this study. On-line state estimation was realized using the extended Kalman filter (EKF), based on a state model of the photobioreactor and on-line local PPFFR measurement. The dynamic state model for the photobioreactor was derived based on mass-balance equations of the relevant states. The measurement equation was established based on an empirical correlation between the microalgal biomass concentration and the local PPFFR measured at a fixed point inside the photobioreactor. An internal model approach was used to estimate the specific growth rate without the need of state-based kinetic expression. The estimator was proven to be capable of estimating biomass concentration and specific growth rate, as well as phosphate and dissolved oxygen concentrations in a photobioreactor illuminated with either fixed or time-varying incident radiation. The quantum sensor was shown to be robust and able to quickly respond to dynamic changes in local PPFFR. In addition, the quantum sensor outputs were not affected by bubble aeration or agitation within the typical operating range. The strong filtering capacity of EKF gives the state estimator superior performance compared to direct calculation from the empirical biomass/local PPFFR correlation. This state estimation system makes use of inexpensive and reliable sensor hardware to report key process dynamics of microalgal photobioreactor cultures on-line, enabling improved operation of such a process. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

However, current NV sensing apparatuses use bulky off-the-shelf components, which greatly increase the system's scale. In [3], a compact platform, which attaches nanodiamond particles to a CMOS sensor, shrinks this spin-based magnetometer to chip scale; however, the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) curve it generates carries large fluctuation leading to inferior sensitivity. In this paper, we present a CMOS-NV quantum sensor with (i) a highly-scalable microwave-delivering structure and (ii) a Talboteffect-based photonic filter with enhanced green-to-red suppression ratio. The former enables coherent driving of an increased number of NV centers, and the latter reduces the shot noise of the photo-detector caused by the input green laser. In addition, the usage of a bulk diamond also enables vector magnetometry, which allows for the tracking of magnetic objects and navigation. The prototype sensor provides a measured vector-field sensitivity of 245nT/Hz {1/2}. © 2019 IEEE.","","Magnetic resonance; Magnetism; Magnetometers; Microwave sensors; Nanodiamonds; Shot noise; Nano-diamond particles; Nitrogen vacancies; Off-the-shelf components; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Room-temperature control; Spatial resolution; Suppression ratios; Vector magnetometry; CMOS integrated circuits","","","","","MIT Center for Integrated Circuits & Systems; Singaporean-MIT Research Alliance; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1839159); Army Research Office, ARO; National Science Foundation, NSF","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. 1839159); Funding text 2: This work is supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. 1839159), MIT Center for Integrated Circuits & Systems, Singaporean-MIT Research Alliance, and Master Dynamic Limited.

Quantum sensors attached to data loggers were operated continuously. Hemispherical photographs were taken monthly above the sensors. An additional quantum sensor was used to monitor PPFD outside the canopy. Sensor measurements show large differences between gap and closed-canopy locations and high daily and seasonal variability at each sensor location, with notable increases in solar radiation in gap stations during September and April. The photographs demonstrate that seasonal variation in PPFD results primarily from shifts in the solar angle relative to canopy openings and secondarily from variation in PPFD levels outside the canopy (cloudiness). Photographs also demonstrate an overall decrease in PPFD with time, for the gap stations, owing to vegetation regrowth. Analyses reveal excellent agreement between sensor PPFD measurements and estimates from hemispherical photographs. Long-term monitoring of PPFD enables calibration of hemispherical photography to permit estimation of PPFD with a high degree of reliability. © 1993.","","canopy opening; hemispherical photography; photosynthetic photon flux density; quantum sensor; solar radiation regime; tropical wet forest","","","","","","","Anderson, Studies of the woodland light climate I The photographic computation of light condition, The Journal of Ecology, 52, pp. 27-41, (1964); Becker, Monthly average solar radiation in Panama—daily and hourly relations between direct and global insolation, Sol.

However, this limit assumes perfect projective measurements of the quantum registers. This requirement is not practical in many physical systems, such as NMR spectroscopy, where a weakly interacting external probe is used as a measurement device. Here, we show that in the framework of quantum nano-NMR spectroscopy, in which these limitations are inherent, the ultimate precision limit is still achievable using control and a finely tuned measurement. © 2020, The Author(s).","","Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Larmor frequencies; Measurement device; Physical systems; Precision limits; Projective measurement; Quantum probe; Quantum register; Quantum sensors; Probes","","","","","ASTERIQS; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (770929); European Research Council, ERC, (667192); Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities","A.R. acknowledges the support of ERC grant QRES, project No. 770929, grant agreement No. 667192 (Hyperdiamond), and the ASTERIQS and DiaPol projects.

When compared to the bulk emission, the collection efficiency was found to have an optimal enhancement of up to 60%, which is nearly 4 times the intrinsic bulk emission value for on-axis nitrogen-vacancy centers.

The concentration of the nitrogen impurity is determined from the infrared (IR) absorption spectrum to be 90 and 4 ppm for the diamond growth sectors {111} and {001}, respectively. The transverse relaxation times T*2 for the electron spin of NV centers are studied; they are found to amount to 200 and 900 ns for the {111} and {001} sectors, respectively, and are limited by the concentration of paramagnetic impurity defects in diamond. The sensitivity of quantum sensors based on the obtained ensembles of NV centers is estimated; the estimation shows feasibility of using denser ensembles in low-field magnetometry. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","","Absorption spectroscopy; Crystal impurities; Diamonds; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Magnetic moments; Nitrogen; Single crystals; 2-MeV electron; Colour centers; Dense arrays; Energy; Nitrogen impurity; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Quantum sensors; Single crystal diamond; Synthetic single crystals; Color centers","","","","","Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ, (20-52-53051)","This study was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, project no. 20-52-53051, using equipment of the Collective-Use Center “All-Russia Research Institute of Optical and Physical Measurements” ( www.ckp.vniiofi.ru ) and the Collective-Use Center “Technological Institute for Superhard and Novel Carbon Materials” ( http://tisnum.ru/suec ).

However, a spatially-distributed array of such sensors, with each sensor measuring only nm-vibrations, may not provide sufficient sensitivity for the prediction of major earthquakes because it fails to exploit potentially critical phase information. We conjecture that relative phase information can explain the anecdotal observations that animals such as lemurs exhibit sensitivity to impending earthquakes earlier than can be done confidently with traditional seismic technology. More specifically, we propose that lemurs use their limbs as ground motion sensors and that relative phase differences are fused in the brain in a manner similar to a phased-array or synthetic-aperture radar. In this paper we will describe a lemur-inspired quantum sensor network for early warning of earthquakes. The system uses 4 interferometric quantum seismographs (e.g., analogous to a lemurs limbs) and then conducts phase and data fusion of the seismic information. Although we discuss a quantum-based technology, the principles described can also be applied to classical sensor arrays. © 2017 SPIE.","Animal Behavior; Earthquakes; Interferometry; Lemurs; Phased Array Radar; Quantum Information; Quantum Radar; Quantum Sensing; Quantum Sensors; Seismography; Seismology; Synthetic Aperture Radar","Animals; Data fusion; Geophysics; Interferometry; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Radar; Radar equipment; Seismographs; Seismology; Sensor networks; Synthetic aperture radar; Animal behavior; Lemurs; Phased array radars; Quantum Information; Quantum Sensing; Quantum sensors; Seismography; Earthquakes","","","","","","","Lanzagorta M., Et al., Quantum seismography, Proceedings of SPIE, 9829, (2016); Lanzagorta M., Quantum Radar, (2011); Ikeya M., Earthquake and Animals: From Folk Legends to Science, (2004); Tributsch H., When the Snakes Awake, (1982); Schaal R.B., An evolution of the animal-behavior theory for earthquake prediction, California Geology, 41, 2, (1988); Kirschvink J.L., Earthquake prediction by animals: Evolution and sensory perception, Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 90, 2, pp. 321-323, (2000); Freund F., Stolc V., Nature of pre-earthquake phenomena and their efects on living organisms, Animals, 3, (2013); United States Geological Survey, (2011); 24, (2011); Shearer P.M., Introduction to Seismology, (2009); Udias A., Principles of Seismology, (1999); Stein S., Wysession M., An Introduction to Seismology, Earthquakes, and Earth Structure, (2014); Aki K., Richards P.G., Quantitative Seismology, (2002); Burridge R., Knopo L., Model and theoretical seismicity, Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 57, 3; Carlson J.M., Langer J.S., Mechanical model of an earthquake fault, Phys.

Canopeo and light interception measurements of canopy cover were linearly related. Canopeo was faster than measuring light interception with the line quantum sensor. Canopy cover is a useful way of monitoring crop productivity, but it can be time-consuming to measure using light interception. The objective of this research was to evaluate soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] canopy cover measured with Canopeo, a new mobile device application, compared with the light interception method. Data were collected from a soybean planting date by relative maturity study established at three locations. Canopy cover was measured every other week throughout the growing season using pictures and videos analyzed by Canopeo and was compared with light interception measurements using a line quantum sensor. There was a linear relationship between canopy cover measured with pictures (R2 = 0.94) and videos (R2 = 0.92) in Canopeo and light interception. These results suggest Canopeo can be used to take pictures or videos to determine canopy cover as a viable alternative to measuring canopy cover in soybean.

Here, we report on the development of a triple-mode broadband waveguide bandpass filter (BPF), which uses a high-Q metallic cavity to transfer the microwave and excite the diamond NV spin ensembles. This BPF provides a more efficient, low-loss, uniform, and broadband microwave signal, as well as a closed space for the NV-quantum sensor. The developed BPF exhibits a large fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 34.8% with a center frequency of 2.87 GHz, and this leads to improve the measurable static magnetic field range up to 5.36 × 10−2 T. Experimental results show that the sensitivity is improved to 14.67 μT/Hz1/2 compared to the patch antenna of 188.49 μT/Hz1/2, that is usually used in the conventional diamond NV-based quantum sensors. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","diamond NV centers; magnetic field sensor; quantum sensor; waveguide bandpass filter","Bandwidth; Diamonds; Magnetic fields; Magnetic sensors; Magnetometers; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Microwave filters; Microwave sensors; Nanocrystals; Slot antennas; Waveguide filters; Accurate measurement; Center-based; Diamond nitrogen-vacancy center; Dynamic range; Magnetic fields sensors; Measurement sensitivity; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Quantum sensors; Waveguide bandpass filter; Bandpass filters","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12174347 62105294)","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 12174347 62105294 Funding information ","Nam J., Lee W., Jung E., Jang G., Magnetic navigation system utilizing a closed magnetic circuit to maximize magnetic field and a mapping method to precisely control magnetic field in real time, IEEE Trans Ind Electron, 65, 7, pp. 5673-5681, (2018); Vollinger C., Todesco E., Identification of assembly faults through the detection of magnetic field anomalies in the production of the LHC dipoles, IEEE Trans Appl Supercond, 16, 2, pp. 204-207, (2006); Li H., Shrestha A., Heidari H., Le Kernec J., Fioranelli F., Magnetic and radar sensing for multimodal remote health monitoring, IEEE Sens J., 19, 20, pp. 8979-8989, (2019); Yang B., Dong Y., Hu Z.-Z., Liu G.-Q., Wang Y.-J., Du G.-X., Noninvasive imaging method of microwave near field based on solid-state quantum sensing, IEEE Trans Microw Theory Tech., 66, 5, pp. 2276-2283, (2018); Yang B., Dong M.-M., He W.-H., Et al., Using diamond quantum magnetometer to characterize near-field distribution of patch antenna, IEEE Trans Microw Theory Tech., 67, 6, pp. 2451-2460, (2019); Chen G.-B., He W.-H., Dong M.-M., Zhao Y., Du G.-X., Nitrogen-vacancy axis orientation measurement in diamond micro-crystal for tunable RF vectorial field sensing, IEEE Sens J., 20, 5, pp. 2440-2445, (2020); Chen G.-B., Gu B.-X., He W.-H., Guo Z.-G., Du G.-X., Vectorial near-field characterization of microwave device by using micro diamond based on tapered fiber, IEEE J Quantum Electron, 56, 3, pp. 1-6, (2020); Hu Z., Yang B., Dong M., Liu Y., Wang Y., Du G., Optical sensing of broadband RF magnetic field using a micrometer-sized diamond, IEEE Trans Magn, 55, 3, pp. 1-4, (2019); Cardoso V.F., Francesko A., Ribeiro C., Banobre-Lopez M., Martins P., Lanceros-Mendez S., Advances in magnetic nanoparticles for biomedical applications, Adv Healthc Mater, 7, 5, (2018); Schmitt S., Gefen T., Sturner F.M., Et al., Submillihertz magnetic spectroscopy performed with a nanoscale quantum sensor, Science, 356, 6340, pp. 832-837, (2017); Yuan H., Yang X., Zhang N., Et al., Frequency-tunable and circularly polarized microwave resonator for magnetic sensing with NV ensembles in diamond, IEEE Sens J., 20, 15, pp. 8477-8482, (2020); Taylor J.M., Cappellaro P., Childress L., Et al., High-sensitivity diamond magnetometer with nanoscale resolution, Nat Phys, 4, 10, pp. 810-816, (2008); Zhang N., Yuan H., Zhang C., Et al., Microwave field uniformity impact on DC magnetic sensing with NV ensembles in diamond, IEEE Sens J, 19, 2, pp. 451-456, (2019); Pham L.M., Magnetic Field Sensing with Nitrogen-Vacancy Color Centers in Diamond.

In this work, we demonstrate for the first time in hardware that tailored light pulses, designed and implemented in software using robust control techniques, can substantially mitigate some of the most nefarious effects in a Bragg atom interferometer. We show experimentally that embedding robust control into sensor operation can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of a state-of-the-art Bragg-pulse cold-atom interferometric sensor by a factor of 4× under ideal conditions. In the presence of laser-intensity noise that varies up to 20% from shot-to-shot, commensurate with common platform vibrations, we show experimentally that using the same robust control solutions preserves fringe visibility with minimal degradation while the utility of the primitive Gaussian pulses collapses, delivering an at least 8× improvement in phase-estimation uncertainty compared with primitive pulse schemes. Across all observations, robust control delivers better performance in a noisy environment than the native hardware performance with primitive pulses under approximately ideal conditions. Finally, building on this demonstration we present a validated theoretical concept to extend this performance improvement to compact devices using concatenated sequences of robust pulses designed to enhance the sensor’s scale factor. Time-domain simulations reveal up to 10× performance enhancement in the presence of realistic atomic-cloud effects at 102ℏk momentum separation. These results show for the first time that software-defined quantum sensor operation can deliver useful performance in environmental regimes where primitive operation is impossible, providing a pathway to augment the performance of current and next generation portable cold-atom inertial sensors in real fielded settings. © 2023 SPIE.","Atom Interferometry; Cold Atoms; Inertial Sensing; Quantum Control; Quantum Gravimetry; Quantum Navigation; Quantum Sensing; Robust Control","Atoms; Interferometers; Interferometry; Signal to noise ratio; Time domain analysis; Visibility; Atom interferometry; Cold atoms; Inertial sensing; Performance; Quantum control; Quantum gravimetry; Quantum navigation; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Sensor operations; Robust control","","","","","","","Berman P., Atom Interferometry, (1997); Kasevich M., Chu S., Atomic interferometry using stimulated Raman transitions, Physical Review Letters, 67, 2, pp. 181-184, (1991); Altin P.

To ease the manufacture of horn arrays, electrolytic deposition of Au on degenerate Si without a metal seed layer was demonstrated.

However, the frequency range of AC sensing protocols based on dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences has not been thoroughly explored experimentally. In this work, we aimed to determine the sensitivity of the ac magnetic field as a function of frequency using the sequential readout method. The upper limit at high frequency is clearly determined by Rabi frequency, in line with the expected effect of finite DD-pulse width. In contrast, the lower frequency limit is primarily governed by the duration of optical repolarization rather than the decoherence time (T (Formula presented.)) of NV spins. This becomes particularly crucial when the repetition (dwell) time of the sequential readout is fixed to maintain the acquisition bandwidth. The equation we provide successfully describes the tendency in the frequency dependence. In addition, at the near-optimal frequency of 1 MHz, we reached a maximum sensitivity of 229 pT/ (Formula presented.)  by employing the XY4-(4) DD sequence. © 2023 by the authors.","AC frequency limit; AC sensing; diamond; nitrogen-vacancy color center; sequential readout","Color centers; Electric impedance measurement; Magnetic fields; Nitrogen; Alternating current; Alternating-current frequency limit; Alternating-current sensing; Colour centers; Current frequency; Current sensing; Frequency limits; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy color center; Sequential readout; Diamonds","","","","","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2019-000296); Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, KRISS; Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP","This research was supported by a grant (GP2022-0010) from Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, and the Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2019-000296).","Glenn D.R., Bucher D.B., Lee J., Lukin M.D., Park H., Walsworth R.L., High-resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopy using a solid-state spin sensor, Nature, 555, pp. 351-354, (2018); Deans C., Cohen Y., Yao H., Maddox B., Vigilante A., Renzoni F., Electromagnetic induction imaging with a scanning radio frequency atomic magnetometer, Appl.

In this paper, we show that the de Broglie wavelength of the electron is changed locally by its interaction with the magnetic vector potential. The vector potential thus acts as a quantum ""phase plate"", changing the phase difference between interfering electron wavefunctions in a non-dispersive, gauge-invariant manner. This model is then shown to be applicable to the design and optimisation of phase-dependent quantum devices such as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), quantum sensors, and so on. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The advantages stem from advanced system miniaturization, thus, requiring far less sample volume while allowing for complex functionality, increased reproducibility, and high throughput. However, LOC applications necessitate extensive sensor miniaturization to leverage these inherent advantages fully. Atom-sized quantum sensors are highly promising to bridge this gap and have enabled measurements of temperature, electric and magnetic fields on the nano- to microscale. Nevertheless, the technical complexity of both disciplines has so far impeded an uncompromising combination of LOC systems and quantum sensors. Here, we present a fully integrated microfluidic platform for solid-state spin quantum sensors, like the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Our platform fulfills all technical requirements, such as fast spin manipulation, enabling full quantum sensing capabilities, biocompatibility, and easy adaptability to arbitrary channel and chip geometries. To illustrate the vast potential of quantum sensors in LOC systems, we demonstrate various NV center-based sensing modalities for chemical analysis in our microfluidic platform, ranging from paramagnetic ion detection to high-resolution microscale NV-NMR. Consequently, our work opens the door for novel chemical analysis capabilities within LOC devices with applications in electrochemistry, high-throughput reaction screening, bioanalytics, organ-on-a-chip, or single-cell studies. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Microfluidics; Reproducibility of Results; Biocompatibility; Lab-on-a-chip; Microfluidics; Miniature instruments; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Quantum theory; fluorine 18; nanodiamond; nitrogen; polyetheretherketone; High-throughput; Lab-on-a-chip applications; Lab-on-a-chip systems; Life-sciences; Microfluidic platforms; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Physical science; Quantum sensors; Science tools; Sensing platforms; Article; biocompatibility; bright field microscopy; chemical analysis; chemical vapor deposition; computer aided design; confocal microscopy; electric field; equipment design; fluorescence intensity; fluorescent lighting; fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance; Fourier transform; high performance liquid chromatography; high throughput screening; magnetic field; microfluidic analysis; microwave irradiation; non invasive procedure; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; optomechanics; photodegradation; process control; quantitative analysis; quantum chemistry; software; solid state; spatial analysis; temperature; three dimensional printing; validation study; microfluidics; reproducibility; Chemical detection","","fluorine 18, 13981-56-1; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; polyetheretherketone, 31694-16-3","Fusion360, Autodesk, United States","Autodesk, United States","Fraunhofer Lighthouse Project Quantum Magnetometry; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Research Council, ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (412351169, EXC 2089/1 – 390776260, EXC-2111 390814868); Horizon 2020, (948049)","This work was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No 948049) and by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) – 412351169 within the Emmy Noether program.

In this paper, a novel method to estimate the parameter of the freeinduction-decay signal based on the adaptive internal model (AIM) controller is proposed and it is verified by the free induction decay data collected from the gyro prototype. In the proposed methods, the AIM con troller can provide estimates of the FID signal, such as the amplitude, the frequency, and the relaxation time. The feasibility of the scheme is proven by theoretical analysis and the reliability of the method is verified by the test results.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

This work explores the use of regression to infer a machine-learned point estimate of an unknown parameter. Although the analysis is necessarily frequentist - relying on repeated estimates to build up statistics - the authors clarify that this machine-learned estimator converges to the Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimator (subject to some regularity conditions). When the number of training measurements is large, this is identical to the well-known maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE), and using this fact, the authors argue that the Cramér-Rao sensitivity bound applies to the mean-square error cost function and can therefore be used to select optimal model and training parameters. The machine-learned estimator inherits the desirable asymptotic properties of the MLE, up to a limit imposed by the resolution of the training grid. Furthermore, the authors investigate the role of quantum noise in the training process and show that this noise imposes a fundamental limit on the number of grid points. This manuscript paves the way for machine-learning to assist the calibration of quantum sensors, thereby allowing maximum-likelihood inference to play a more prominent role in the design and operation of the next generation of ultra-precise sensors.  © 2021 Author(s).","","","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (820419)","We would like to thank V.

But an emerging class of quantum sensors that use Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) to detect rf electric fields have yet to reach the SQL. In this work we prove that this discrepancy is due to fundamental limitations in the EIT probing mechanism. We derive the optimum sensitivity of a three-level quantum sensor based on EIT, or more generally coherent spectroscopy, and compare this to the SQL. We apply a minimal set of assumptions, while allowing strong probing fields, thermal broadening, and large optical depth. We derive the optimal laser intensities and optical depth, providing specific guidelines for sensitive operation under common experimental conditions. Clear boundaries of performance are established, revealing that ladder-EIT cannot achieve the SQL due to unavoidable absorption loss. The results may be applied to any EIT-based quantum sensor, but we particularly emphasize our results' importance to the growing field of Rydberg quantum sensing. © 2021 Published by the American Physical Society","","Electric fields; Quantum optics; Transparency; Coherent spectroscopies; Electromagnetically-induced transparency; Fundamental limitations; Optical depth; Optimum Sensitivity; Quantum sensors; Rf electric fields; Rydberg; Standard quantum limits; Three-level; Quantum entanglement","","","","","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Office of Naval Research Naval Air Warfare Center; Weapons Division; Office of Naval Research, ONR; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division, NAWCWD","Funding text 1: The authors thank Clement Wong for helpful discussions and recognize financial support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Quantum Apertures program.

So far, the world has not found a substitute product, so wire rope detection has become an essential part of daily maintenance. As a non-destructive testing technology, magnetic flux leakage (MFL) testing technology can quickly and efficiently detect the wire rope without damaging its structure. Conventional hall sensors and TMR sensors are used to collect magnetic field signals in traditional magnetic flux leakage detection. Diamond N-vacancy (NV) color center, a new quantum sensor developed in recent years, greatly improves sensitivity and detection accuracy compared with the traditional magnetic sensor. This work will build a measurement system with an NV color center quantum sensor, then detects the magnetic leakage field caused by defects on the surface of the wire rope and judge the location of defects through signal processing and drawing images. According to the experimental results, the system can accurately detect the defects of steel wire rope and provide a new method for industrial safety. © 2022 IET Conference Proceedings.

However, these devices are prone to noise and environmental factors that can degrade the quality of the data and compromise the accuracy of the measurements. This research proposes an effective Adversarial Autoencoders (AAEs) framework for denoising and signal recovery in QGs to improve the accuracy and reliability of navigation systems in space. By denoising signals, AAEs can improve the accuracy of measurements and can help reduce the risk of communication failures and increase the efficiency of cognitive communication systems. Overall, our method offers a promising solution for denoising and signal recovery in noisy QG schemes, demonstrating that it can accurately recover signals with low reconstruction error. This approach has the potential to improve the reliability and accuracy of QGs, leading to safer and more efficient communication systems. © 2023 IEEE.","Deep learning; Neural network; Quantum Metrology; Quantum Sensing; Quantum Sensors","Cognitive systems; Deep learning; Gyroscopes; Learning systems; Navigation systems; Signal denoising; Space applications; Auto encoders; Communications systems; Critical component; De-noising; Deep learning; Neural-networks; Quantum metrology; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Signal recovery; Signal reconstruction","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (OMA 2231377)","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by National Science Foundation Grant No. OMA 2231377.","Passaro V., Cuccovillo A., Vaiani L., De Carlo M., Campanella C.E., Gyroscope technology and applications: A review in the industrial perspective, Sensors, 17, (2017); Edu I., Obreja R., Grigorie T., Current technologies and trends in the development of gyros used in navigation applications: A review, (2011); Armenise M., Ciminelli C., Leonardis F., Diana R., Passaro V., Peluso F., Gyroscope Technologies for Space Applications, (2003); Degen C.L., Reinhard F., Cappellaro P., Quantum sensing, Reviews of Modern Physics, (2017); Shimazoe K., Et al., Quantum sensing for biomedical applications, 2021 IEEE Nucl.

Three dimensional high-coherence time microwave cavities embedded with electro-optic nonlinear dielectric materials provide promising platforms to boost the efficiency of the microwave-optic frequency conversion. However, so far, the properties for such dielectric crystals operating at milli-Kelvin cryogenic temperatures have not been well understood. Here, we propose a scheme to precisely measure and benchmark the dielectric constant and analyze the dissipation mechanisms of electro-optic materials, such as Lithium Niobate, at the quantum threshold. We will use Fermilab's three dimensional superconducting cavities with long coherence time.

This performance has already been demonstrated in arrays of transition edge sensors. A critical step is demonstrating a method of fabrication and assembly that maintains the performance but that is extendable to create large-scale arrays suitable, for example, for application in dispersive spectrometers where it may be advantageous to fabricate the array from smaller sub-Arrays. Critical here are the methods of assembly and metrology that maintain the required tolerances on the spatial alignment of the components in order to maintain overall performance.

Quantum error correction (QEC) can enhance sensitivity by suppressing decoherence, but it has a side effect: it biases a sensor's output in realistic settings. If unaccounted for, this bias can systematically reduce a sensor's performance in experiment, and also give misleading values for the minimum detectable signal in theory. We analyze this effect in the experimentally motivated setting of continuous-time QEC, showing both how one can remedy it, and how incorrect results can arise when one does not. © 2022 American Physical Society.","","Continuous time systems; Error correction; Continous time; Decoherence; Detectable signal; Quantum error corrections; Quantum sensors; Sensor output; Sensor performance; Side effect; Time quantum; article; Quantum theory","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; National Center of Competence in Research Quantum Science and Technology, NCCR QSIT, (51NF40–160591, PZ00P2_186040)","I. R. thanks D.

It is a serious problem that we have to employ the excited state (ES) of VSi with very low temperature sensitivity for quantum sensing due to there being no temperature sensitivity for the ground state (GS). Here, we propose a temperature measurement protocol, simultaneously resonated optically detected magnetic resonance (SRODMR), based on the modulation of the GS ODMR response resulting from simultaneous resonance of both GS and ES. This protocol diverts part of the GS ODMR contrast to temperature measurement, and in principle, temperature can be measured at an equivalent signal intensity to that of GS ODMR. SRODMR improves signal intensity by 1 order of magnitude compared with the conventional method (ES ODMR), leading to temperature measurements with a smaller error.  © 2023 American Physical Society.","","Excited states; Magnetic resonance; Quantum theory; Silicon carbide; Temperature; Temperature measurement; Temperature sensors; Excited-states; Low temperature sensitivity; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Quantum sensors; Signal intensities; Silicon carbide devices; Silicon vacancies; Temperature sensing; Temperature sensitivity; Very low temperatures; Ground state","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (20H00355, 21H04553); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (JPMXS0118067395)","Acknowledgments.—This study is partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI 21H04553 and 20H00355, MEXT Quantum Leap Flagship Program (MEXT Q-LEAP) Grant No. JPMXS0118067395.","Gruber A., Drabenstedt A., Tietz C., Fleury L., Wrachtrup J., von Borczyskowski C., Scanning confocal optical microscopy and magnetic resonance on single defect centers, Science, 276, (1997); Kucsko G., Maurer P.

This is achieved after training the network with a collection of known inputs and results leading to an adjustment of the neuron connections and biases. In the context of quantum detection schemes, NNs find a natural playground. In particular, in the presence of a target (e.g. an electromagnetic field), a quantum sensor delivers a response, i.e. the input data, which can be subsequently processed by a NN that outputs the target features. In this work we demonstrate that adequately trained NNs enable to characterize a target with (i) minimal knowledge of the underlying physical model (ii) in regimes where the quantum sensor presents complex responses and (iii) under a significant shot noise due to a reduced number of measurements. We exemplify the method with a development for 171Yb+ atomic sensors. However, our protocol is general, thus applicable to arbitrary quantum detection scenarios. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Atomic-size quantum sensor; Neural network; Quantum detection; Quantum magnetometry; Quantum parameter estimation","Electromagnetic fields; Input output programs; Shot noise; Atomic sensors; Complex response; Input datas; Physical model; Quantum detection; Quantum sensors; Target feature; Neural networks","","","","","SFI-DfE, (15/IA/2864, EUR2020-112117, RYC2018-025197-I); Spanish Government, (PGC2018-095113-B-I00); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (820363, 820505, 828826); Eusko Jaurlaritza, (IT986-16); Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, EHU; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN","We acknowledge financial support from Spanish Government via PGC2018-095113-B-I00 (MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE), Basque Government via IT986-16, as well as from QMiCS (820505) and OpenSuperQ (820363) of the EU Flagship on Quantum Technologies, and the EU FET Open Grant Quromorphic (828826).

We extend quantum metrology beyond this standard setting and consider the estimation of a physical process with quantum memory, here referred to as a parametrized quantum comb. We present a theoretic framework of metrology of quantum combs, and derive a general upper bound of the comb quantum Fisher information. The bound can be operationally interpreted as the quantum Fisher information of a memoryless quantum channel times a dimensional factor. We then show an example where the bound can be attained up to a factor of 4. With the example and the bound, we show that memory in quantum sensors plays an even more crucial role in the estimation of combs than in the standard setting of quantum metrology. © 2019 American Physical Society.","","Fisher information matrix; Quantum channel; Quantum communication; Quantum entanglement; Fisher information; General upper bound; Memory effects; Physical process; Quantum memory; Quantum metrology; Quantum sensors; Standard setting; Communication channels (information theory)","","","","","National Center for Competence in Research, (200020_165843); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, RGC, UGC, (17300918)","The author is grateful to Giulio Chiribella, Joseph M.

In this concept, the coincidence dark and bright soliton pair within the MZI can be arranged by using the phase controller, in which (|D〉) and (|B〉) states represent the orthogonal dark and bright solitons, respectively. We assume that both solitons are input into the MZI ports simultaneously (coincidently). The randomly input dark and bright soliton states into the MZI ports can perform the change in phase after propagating through a phase shifter/sensing unit, in which the phase change recovery using the phase related measurement device can be provided. By using the orthogonal soliton behaviors, a sensing application using a soliton(photon) pair can be formed. Moreover, the soliton power can be reduced to a single photon power (10 -6 W), where finally the single photon sensor can be operated. The self calibration concept between signal and referencing arms of a MZI can also be established, which is discussed in details. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Optical sensor; orthogonal soliton sensor; phase sensor; quantum sensor","Optical sensors; Particle beams; Sensors; Bright solitons; In-phase; Measurement device; Phase Change; Quantum sensors; Self calibration; Sensing applications; Single photons; Soliton pairs; Solitons","","","","","","","Rao Y.J., Webb D.J., Jackson D.A., Zhang L., Bennion I., Optical in-fiber Bragg grating sensor systems for medical applications, Journal of Biomedical Optics, 3, 1, pp. 38-44, (1998); Grillet A., Kinet D., Witt J., Schukar M., Krebber K., Pirotte F., Depre A., Optical fiber sensors embedded into medical textiles for healthcare monitoring, IEEE J.

On the other hand, quantum sensors, capable of working with nanoscale precision, do not provide precise frequency resolution over a wide range of frequencies. Using a single spin in diamond, we present a measurement protocol for quantum probes which enables full signal reconstruction on a nanoscale spatial resolution up to potentially 100 GHz. We achieve 58nT/Hz amplitude and 0.095rad/Hz phase sensitivity and a relative frequency uncertainty of 10-12 for a 1.51 GHz signal within 10 s of integration.

However, the most-advanced type of Penning trap mass spectrometer up to date needs a drastic improvement in order to contribute from a Q-value measurement to the mass determination of the electron antineutrino at the level of 10 -12 as pursued by the international MARE collaboration measuring the end-point of the decay 187Re to 187Os. In this contribution, a novel device, called quantum sensor, is proposed to measure the mass of a single ion with ultimate accuracy and unprecedented sensitivity while it is stored and cooled in a trap. The quantum sensor is made of a reference ion suspended in vacuum by the electric and magnetic field of a Penning trap, and laser cooled to very low temperatures. By wiring this ion with the ion of interest, the mass of the later can be determined from its cyclotron frequency using the fluorescence of the reference ion. This paper will present the application of the quantum sensor in the determination of the mass of the neutrino. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.","ion cooling; ion trapping; Neutrino mass and mixing","","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (278648)","","Ahmad Q.R., Et al., Phys.

Within our work on integrated sensors, we develop miniaturized, ultra-stable optical setups for optical cooling and trapping of cold atomic gases. Besides challenging demands on alignment precision, and thermo-mechanical durability, we specifically address ultra-high vacuum (UHV) compatibility of our integration technologies and optical components. A prototype design of an UHV-compatible, crossed beam optical dipole trap setup and its application within a cold atomic quantum sensor is described. First qualification efforts on adhesive micro-integration technologies are presented. These tests are conducted in application-relevant geometries and material combinations common for micro-integrated optical setups. Adhesive aging will be investigated by thermal cycling or gamma radiation exposure. For vacuum compatibility testing, a versatile UHV testing system is currently being set up, enabling residual gas analysis and measurement of total gas rates down to 5•10-10mbar l/s at a base pressure of 10-11 mbar, exceeding the common ASTM E595 test. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.","Adhesive; Cold atoms; Environmental testing; Micro-integration; Miniaturized optical setups; Outgassing; Qualification; Quantum sensors; Residual gas analysis; Ultra-high vacuum","Adhesives; Atoms; Degassing; Environmental testing; Integration; Integration testing; Small satellites; Ultrahigh vacuum; Cold atoms; Micro integration; Optical set-up; Qualification; Quantum sensors; Residual gas analysis; Photonic integration technology","","","","","German Space Agency DLR; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi, (DLR 50WM1648)","This work is supported by the German Space Agency DLR with funds provided by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy under grant number DLR 50WM1648.","Oi D.K.L., Et al., Nanosatellites for quantum science and technology, Contemporary Physics, 58, 1, pp. 25-52, (2017); Wicht A., Et al., Narrow linewidth diode laser modules for quantum optical sensor applications in the field and in space, Proc.

The qubit associated with the NV centre ground state spin has been the key element for the realisation of such applications. Its coherence time determines the application performances, e.g. the sensitivity of the NV-qubit based quantum sensor. Due to unwanted and unavoidable interactions with noisy environment, the qubit undergoes decoherence that shortens its coherence time and hence reduces its application performance. Therefore, the investigation and mitigation of the decoherence of the NV qubit are of the utmost importance. Here, we simulate the qubit decoherence using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that is essential for designing a set of modulating control pulses to mitigate the effect. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Magnetic resonance; Nitrogen; Optical properties; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Application performance; Coherence time; Decoherence; Ground-state spins; Key elements; Microwave field; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process; Spin qubit; Ground state","","","","","","","Rieger P, Electron Spin Resonance The Royal Society of Chemistry, (2007); Kuzmany H, Solid-State Spectroscopy : An Introduction, (1998); Schwart I, Rosskopf J, Schmitt S, Tratzmiller B, Chen Q, McGuiness L P., Jelezko F, Plenio M B., Scientific Reports, 9, (2019); Doherty M W., Dolde F, Fedder H, Jelezko F, Wratchrup J, Manson N B., Hollenberg L C.

Among the various sensors proposed for biological applications, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in artificial diamond have emerged as a truly promising solution primarily thanks to their excellent bio-compatibility. Such NV sensors can be synthesized of nanometer size. The nanodiamonds can be inserted inside cells and, if properly functionalized, they can be targeted to organelles, such as mitochondria, or ion channels. In addition to the advantages regarding their chemical and structural composition, the NV sensors have distinguished themselves thanks to their sensitivity respect different physical quantity, such as magnetic and electric fields, temperatures and pressures variations. Although the sensitivity achieved by the NV quantum sensors is not yet sufficient to detect the very weak electromagnetic fields generated by biological processes, the thermal variation generated at the cellular level seem at the moment a more attractive field of application. Temperature is an important parameter for the regulation of intracellular processes and its detection is fundamental for a more complete understanding of them. Cellular activity and metabolism can affect the local temperature in cells and pathological conditions such as cancer, Parkinson and Alzherimer's disease can alter it. In this sense, local temperature monitoring within cells is also important for clinical application. Here we will present our experimental setup dedicated to local temperature measurement in neuronal cell cultures. The measurement technique is based on optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) with the NV centers in the nanodiamonds, suitably engineered to be sensitive and at the same time bio-compatible. We will demonstrate a proof of principle experiment in which we measure the local temperature variation in cultured hippocampal neurons. The temperature sensitivity is 3 K/Hzl/2. In addition we will show how the nanodiamonds with a size of around 200 nm are internalized by the neurons. © 2022 IEEE.","biological applications; cell temperature; neurons; NV center; quantum sensors","Cell culture; Electric fields; Electromagnetic fields; Magnetic resonance; Nanodiamonds; Neurons; Nitrogen; Sensitivity analysis; Temperature distribution; Temperature measurement; Biological applications; Biological process; Cell's temperatures; Complex mechanisms; Local temperature; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Physical quantities; Quantum sensors; Temperature variation; Cells","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (828946); European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research, EMPIR; European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020, (19NRM06, 20IND05)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work has received funding from the European Commission’s PATHOS EU H2020 FET-OPEN grant no. 828946 and Horizon 2020.

We report our latest results on a range of AlGaInN diode-lasers targeted to meet the linewidth, wavelength and power requirements suitable for quantum sensors such as optical clocks and cold-atom interferometry systems. This includes the [5s2S1/2-5p2P1/2] cooling transition in strontium+ ion optical clocks at 422 nm, the [5s21S0-5p1P1] cooling transition in neutral strontium clocks at 461 nm and the [5s2s1/2 - 6p2P3/2] transition in rubidium at 420 nm. Several approaches are taken to achieve the required linewidth, wavelength and power, including an extended cavity laser diode (ECLD) system and an on-chip grating, distributed feedback (DFB) GaN laser diode.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The 3D arrayed VSi’s were created by proton beam writing using different ion (proton) energies. The photoluminescence (PL) mapping analysis indicates that the features of the luminescent spot, such as size and depth, can be estimated by a Monte Carlo simulation (SRIM). This suggests that assessment at any location within the SiC device can be realized using VSi quantum sensors. Luminescent spots, with depth ranging 4-60 µm, showed similar ODMR spectra including contrast which indicates that similar sensor sensitivity can be realized. This suggests that the 3D arrayed VSi implemented in this work can act as quantum sensor elements with uniform sensitivity in SiC devices. © 2020 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.","Color center; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Pn diode; Proton beam writing; Three-dimensional array","Luminescence; Magnetic resonance; Monte Carlo methods; Silicon carbide; Mapping analysis; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Proton beam writing; Quantum sensors; Sensor sensitivity; SiC devices; Silicon vacancies; Threedimensional (3-d); Vanadium compounds","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (17H01056, 18H03770); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (JPMXS0118067395)","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI 17H01056 and 18H03770, MEXT Quantum Leap Flagship Program (MEXT Q-LEAP) Grant Number JPMXS0118067395.

However, V B − has magnetic resonance spectra broadened by hyperfine interactions, which decreases the signal contrast and thus degrades the magnetic field sensitivity. Here we propose multi-frequency composite pulse sequences to enhance the contrast of the measurement signal in the Rabi oscillation. We demonstrate that the sequence using five microwave frequencies enhances the signal contrast, improving the sensitivity by a factor of 2.3 compared to the conventional sequence. © 2023 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.","magnetic resonance; quantum control; quantum sensor; sensitivity; van der Waals","III-V semiconductors; Magnetic resonance; Nitrides; Quantum theory; Van der Waals forces; Composite pulse sequences; Hyperfine interactions; Magnetic resonance spectra; Multi frequency; Negatively charged; Quantum control; Quantum sensors; Sensitivity; Sensitivity enhancements; Van der Waal; Boron nitride","","","","","Forefront Physics and Mathematics Program; Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Research Center at the University of Tokyo; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP19H00656, JP19H05826, JP22K03524, JP23H01103); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (JPMXP1222UT22); University of Tokyo","We would like to express our gratitude to K.

The relevant energy scales in soft matter systems are comparable to thermal energy (k B T ∼ 10-21 J). This permits one to observe interesting structural dynamics even at ambient conditions. However, at the nanoscale most experimental probes currently being used to study these systems have been either plagued by low sensitivity or are invasive at molecular scales. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is emerging as a robust quantum probe for precision metrology of physical quantities (e.g. magnetic field, electric field, temperature, and stress). Here, we demonstrate by using NV sensors to probe spin-fluctuations and temperature simultaneously to obtain information about controlled phase changes in a soft matter material as a function of temperature. The soft matter system chosen for the study is a standard liquid crystalline (LC) material which shows distinct phases close to room temperature. Individual NV centers at depths of a few nm are used as a probe to detect magnetic signals emanating from a few molecular layers of sample on the surface of the diamond. The organization and collective dynamics of LC molecules in nanoscopic volumes are discussed. Our study aims to extend the areas of application of quantum sensing using NV centers to probe the soft matter systems, particularly those exhibiting mesophases and interesting interfacial properties. © 2019 The Author(s).

A ‘Plexiglass’ tank is interposed between a light source and cuvette and PPFD changed by varying the level of dyed liquid in the tank. The amount of liquid pumped into or drained from the tank is a function of the difference (error) between a defined set point value of PPFD and that measured in the cuvette. The set point can be varied as a function of time, can follow the output of a quantum sensor measuring ambient PPFD or can be driven by values of PPFD read from a data file. Within the 0.4 to 0.64 μm waveband, the dye acts as a neutral density filter so that there is no change in spectral distribution with PPFD. Photosynthetic photon flux density in the cuvette was controlled to better than 20 μmol m−2s−1 when the set point was varied from 200 to 1100 μmol m−2s−1 over 3 min. When the set point was held constant or changed less rapidly, errors did not exceed 5 μmol m−2s−1.

Whereas conventional NMR requires averaging over large ensembles, recent progress with single-spin quantum sensors2–9 has created the prospect of magnetic imaging of individual molecules10–13. As an initial step towards this goal, isolated nuclear spins and spin pairs have been mapped14–21. However, large clusters of interacting spins—such as those found in molecules—result in highly complex spectra. Imaging these complex systems is challenging because it requires high spectral resolution and efficient spatial reconstruction with sub-ångström precision. Here we realize such atomic-scale imaging using a single nitrogen vacancy centre as a quantum sensor, and demonstrate it on a model system of 27 coupled 13C nuclear spins in diamond. We present a multidimensional spectroscopy method that isolates individual nuclear–nuclear spin interactions with high spectral resolution (less than 80 millihertz) and high accuracy (2 millihertz).

However, the basis for choosing the threshold between the two components of radiation has not been systematically determined. We evaluated the basis and methods for separating direct and diffuse radiation under field conditions. Daily courses of direct and diffuse photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFDs) over and under canopies were measured with quantum sensors and were predicted from hemispherical photographs. We proposed a new variable, called the diffuse coefficient of canopy (dc), to compensate for the increase in the diffuse radiation component as the sunlight passes through the overstory canopy. dc was highly correlated with canopy coverage (cc) (dc = 0.01cc - 0.3, r2 = 0.95). For woodland sites, PPFD can be predicted from hemispherical photographs according to the following equations: Wdir = Sout(τ - dc)M sinα and Wdif = Sout (0.271 - 0.294(τ - dc)M) sinα, where Wdir and Wdif are the direct and diffuse radiation components in woodland sites, Sout is the extraterrestrial PPFD normal to the solar beam, τ is the atmospheric transmittance, M is the optical airmass number and α is the solar elevation. The daily courses of PPFD and sunflecks under canopies can be estimated from hemispherical photographs when the effects of dc are considered.","Canopy cover; Diffuse coefficient; Hemispherical photograph; Sunfleck","Air Craft; Forest Canopy; Forestry; Photography; Photosynthesis; Plants; Radiation Effects; Sensors; Sun Light; Wood; Aerial photography; Photons; Photosynthesis; Plants (botany); Radiation effects; Sensors; Solar radiation; Wood; Canopy cover; Diffuse coefficient; Hemispherical photograph; Light diffusion effect; Photosynthetic photon dlux densities; Quantum sensors; Sunflecks; Woodland; Forestry","","","","","","","Anderson M.C., Studies of the woodland light climate.

The results showed that the 98% accuracy of the total radiation measured with CNR1 (QCNR1) could satisfy the technical criterion for the sites except Xishuangbanna where the QCNR1 was averagely about 7% lower than QCNR1, the radiation measured with high accuracy pyranometer CM11. For most sites, though the temperature had definite effects on the performance of CNR1, the effects were still within the allowable range of the accuracy of the instrument. Besides temperature, the seasonal fog often occurred in tropical rain forests in Xishuangbanna also had effects on the performance of CNR1. Based on the long-term variations of PAR, especially its ratio to total radiation in the 4 sites, it was found that quantum sensor (Li-190SB) had obvious performance attenuation, with the mean annual attenuation rate being about 4%. To correct the observation error caused by Li-190SB, an attempt was made to give a post-correction of the PAR observations, which could basically eliminate the quantum sensor's performance attenuation due to long-term field measurement.","ChinaFLUX; Observation error; Photosynthetically active radiation; Radiometer performance; Total radiation","China; Ecosystem; Photosynthesis; Radiation; Radiation Monitoring; Sunlight; Trees; China; accuracy assessment; correction; fog; forest ecosystem; light attenuation; long-term change; performance assessment; photosynthetically active radiation; radiometer; rainforest; sensor; spatiotemporal analysis; uncertainty analysis; article; China; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; instrumentation; methodology; photosynthesis; physiology; radiation; radiation monitoring; sunlight; tree","","","","","","","Wang B.-Z., Measurement and Standard of Solar Radiation Energy, (1993); Li Z.Q., Yu G.R., Wen X.F., Et al., Energy balance closure at ChinaFLUX sites, Science in China Series D, 48, pp. 51-62, (2005); Wilson K., Goldstein A., Falge E., Et al., Energy balance closure at FLUXNET sites, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 113, pp. 223-243, (2002); Foken T., The energy balance closure problem: An overview, Ecological Applications, 18, pp. 1351-1367, (2008); Bai J.-H., Calculating photosynthetically active radiation in north China, Climatic and Environment Research, 25, 2, pp. 1-8, (2009); Zhou Y.-H., Xiang Y.-Q., Shan F.-Z., Climatological calculation for photosynthetically active radiation density, Acta Meteorologica Sinica, 54, 4, pp. 447-455, (1996); Zhang X.Z., Zhang Y.G., Zhou T.H., Measuring and modeling photosynthetically active radiation in Tibet Plateau during April-October, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 102, pp. 207-212, (2000); Falge E., Baldocchi D., Olson R., Et al., Gap filling strategies for defensible annual sums of net ecosystem exchange, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 107, pp. 43-69, (2001); Zhang L.M., Yu G.R., Sun X.M., Et al., Seasonal variations of ecosystem apparent quantum yield(a) and maximum photosynthesis rate (P<sub>max</sub>) of different forest ecosystems in China, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 137, pp. 176-187, (2006); Yu G.R., Wen X.F., Sun X.M., Et al., Overview of China FLUX and evaluation of its eddy covariance measurement, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 137, pp. 125-137, (2006); Yu G.R., Zhang L.M., Sun X.M., Et al., Advances in carbon flux observation and research in Asia, Science in China Series D, 48, pp. 1-16, (2005); Sun X.M., Zhu Z.L., Wen X.F., Et al., The impact of averaging period on eddy fluxes observed at China-FLUX sites, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 137, pp. 188-193, (2006); Zhu Z.L., Sun X.M., Zhou Y.L., Et al., Correcting method of eddy covariance fluxes observed at non-flat surfaces and its application in ChinaFLUX, Science in China Series D, 48, pp. 42-50, (2005); Foken T., Wichura B., Tools for quality assessment of surface-based flux measurements, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 78, pp. 83-105, (1996); Ross J., Sulev M., Sources of errors in measurements of PAR, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 100, pp. 103-125, (2000); Hu B., Wang Y.-S., Liu G.-R., A study of ultraviolet and photosynthetically active radiation pyranometer calibration method, Climatic and Environmental Research, 15, 2, pp. 201-216, (2010); Manual of Net Radiometer CNR1 and Manual of Pyranometer CM11; Zhang Y.P., Sha L.Q., Yu G.R., Et al., Annual variation of carbon flux and impact factors in the tropical seasonal rain forest of Xishuangbanna, SW China, Science in China Series D, 49, pp. 150-162, (2006); Bai J.-H., Measurement and calculation of photosynthetically active radiation at Luancheng region, Chinese Journal of Agrometeorology, 31, 2, pp. 211-218, (2010); Ma J.-Y., Liu J.-M., Li S.-K., Et al., Study on the features of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) with experimentations and measurements, Journal of Natural Resources, 22, 5, pp. 673-682, (2007)","X.-M.

Commercial alkali sources are electrically heated to 400 - 700C, driving a chemical reaction which produces the alkali. These sources use high current, high power, operate at high temperatures, turn on and off slowly, and evolve impurities. We report here on solid state electrolytic sources for the production of cesium and rubidium at temperatures of 80C to 170C. The advantages of electrolytic sources over thermally driven sources are reduced current and power consumption, faster turn-on and turn-off, the ability to monitor the quantity of generated alkali by current integration, and reduced temperature of operation. Resistivity and activation energy of the solid ionic conductors was measured vs. temperature. Alkali vapor pressure was detected by optical absorption in a custom vacuum system. Strong alkali signals (comparable to commercial sources) were measured when current was passed through the samples. Reversing the polarity of the applied voltage results in ambient alkali absorption. These Solid State Ambipolar Alkali Sources (SSAAS) show potential as high purity, precision alkali sources for cold atom sensors where size, weight and power must be reduced. © 2016 TRF","","Activation energy; Actuators; Atoms; Ionic conduction in solids; Light absorption; Metals; Microsystems; Thermionic emission; Alkali sources; Applied voltages; Commercial sources; High currents; High temperature; Quantum sensors; Solid ionic conductors; Thermally driven; Solid-state sensors","","","","","DARPA Cold Atom MicroSystems; Joseph Louis; Solid State Ambipolar Alkali Source, (HR0011-14-C-0115); U.S. Department of Defense, DOD; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, CAMS","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the DARPA Cold Atom MicroSystems (CAMS) Solid State Ambipolar Alkali Source (SSAAS) program (contract # HR0011-14-C-0115).

Generically, the sensitivity of a quantum sensor consisting of N independent particles is proportional to N. However, interactions invariably occurring at high densities lead to a breakdown of the assumption of independence between the particles, posing a severe challenge for quantum sensors operating at the nanoscale. Here, we show that interactions in quantum sensors can be transformed from a nuisance into an advantage when strong interactions trigger a dissipative phase transition in an open quantum system. We demonstrate this behavior by analyzing dissipative quantum sensors based upon nitrogen-vacancy defect centers in diamond. Using both a variational method and a numerical simulation of the master equation describing the open quantum many-body system, we establish the existence of a dissipative first order transition that can be used for quantum sensing. We investigate the properties of this phase transition for two- and three-dimensional setups, demonstrating that the transition can be observed using current experimental technology. Finally, we show that quantum sensors based on dissipative phase transitions are particularly robust against imperfections such as disorder or decoherence, with the sensitivity of the sensor not being limited by the T2 coherence time of the device. Our results can readily be applied to other applications in quantum sensing and quantum metrology where interactions are currently a limiting factor. © 2018 American Physical Society.","","Quantum optics; Vacancies; First order transitions; High-density quantum; Nitrogen vacancies; Open quantum systems; Quantum many-body systems; Quantum technologies; Strong interaction; Variational methods; Numerical methods","","","","","Volkswagen Foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (SFB 1227)","We thank D. D. B.

However, solid-state spins are controlled using complex microwave pulse sequences, which are typically generated using benchtop electrical instruments. Integration of the required electronics will enable realization of a scalable low-power and compact optically addressable quantum system. Here, we report an integrated reconfigurable quantum control system, which is used to perform Rabi and Ramsey oscillation measurements for an NV center in diamond. The 180nm CMOS chip, fabricated within a footprint of 3.02mm2, consumes 80 mW of power, and is capable of generating a tunable microwave signal from 1.6 GHz to 2.6 GHz modulated with a sequence of up to 4098 reconfigurable pulses with a pulse width adjustable from 10ns to 42ms and a pulse-to-pulse delay adjustable between 18 ns to 42m, at a resolution of 2.5 ns.  © 2022 IEEE.","CMOS integrated circuits; microwave; NV center; quantum computing; qubit","Control systems; Electrospinning; Microwaves; Quantum optics; Qubits; Timing circuits; Building blockes; Electron spins; Emerging applications; NV center; Quantum Computing; Quantum information science; Quantum spin; Reconfigurable; Solid-state electron; Spin control; CMOS integrated circuits","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (ECCS-1842655)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by NSF grant ECCS-1842655.","Guevel L.L., Et al., A 110mK 295μ W 28nm fdsoi cmos quantum integrated circuit with a 2.8GHz excitation and nA current sensing of an on-chip double quantum dot, IEEE ISSCC, pp. 306-307, (2020); Patra B., Et al., A Scalable cryo-CMOS 2-to-20GHz digitally intensive controller for 4×32 frequency multiplexed spin qubits/transmons in 22nm FinFET technology for quantum computers, IEEE ISSCC, pp. 304-305, (2020); Kim D., Et al., A CMOS-integrated quantum sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centres, Nat Electron, 2, pp. 284-289, (2019); Ruffino, Et al., A Fully-integrated 40-nm 5-6.5 GHz cryo-CMOS system-on-chip with i-q receiver and frequency synthesizer for scalable multiplexed readout of quantum dots, IEEE ISSCC, pp. 210-212, (2021); Park J.-S., Et al., Fully integrated cryo-CMOS SoC for qubit control in quantum computers capable of state manipulation, readout and highspeed gate pulsing of spin qubits in Intel 22nm ffl FinFET technology, IEEE ISSCC, pp. 208-210, (2021); Schirhagl R., Et al., Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond: nanoscale sensors for physics and biology, Annu.

We report our latest results on a range of AlGaInN diode-lasers targeted to meet the linewidth, wavelength and power requirements suitable for optical clocks and cold-atom interferometry systems. This includes the [5s2S1/2-5p2P1/2] cooling transition in strontium+ ion optical clocks at 422 nm, the [5s21S0-5p1P1] cooling transition in neutral strontium clocks at 461 nm and the [5s2s1/2 - 6p2P3/2] transition in rubidium at 420 nm. Several approaches are taken to achieve the required linewidth, wavelength and power, including an extended cavity laser diode (ECLD) system and an on-chip grating, distributed feedback (DFB) GaN laser diode. © 2020 SPIE.","","Aluminum compounds; Atomic clocks; Diodes; Gallium nitride; Heterojunctions; III-V semiconductors; Indium compounds; Interferometry; Laser applications; Nanoelectronics; Nanosensors; Optical communication; Quantum cryptography; Semiconductor lasers; Strontium; Thermal management (electronics); Cold atom interferometry; Cooling transitions; Distributed feedback; Extended cavity lasers; Optical atomic clocks; Power requirement; Quantum technologies; Strontium clocks; Atom lasers","","","","","UK innovation agency; European Commission, EC, (E!10509); Narodowe Centrum BadaÅ i Rozwoju, NCBR, (1/POLBER-3/2018, E10509/29/NCBR/2017, NCN-2013/11/B/ST3/04263); Innovate UK","Acknowledgements: This research has been supported by the European Union with grant E!10509, the UK innovation agency, Innovate UK and the National Centre for Research and Development (E10509/29/NCBR/2017 and 1/POLBER-3/2018 and Project NCN-2013/11/B/ST3/04263).","Najda S.P., Slight T., Perlin P., Odedina O., Suski T., Marona L., Stanczyk S., Leszczynski M., Wisniewski P., Czernecki R., Targowski G., Kelly A.E., Journal of Physics: ICSLS 23 IoP Conference Series, (2016); Najda S.P., Perlin P., Suski T., Marona L., Stanczyk S., Leszczynski M., Wisniewski P., Czernecki R., Targowski G., Carson C., Stothard D., McKnight L.J., Proc.

Here we report the photosynthetic (400-700 nm) photon efficiency and photon distribution pattern of two double-ended HPS fixtures, five mogul-base HPS fixtures, ten LED fixtures, three ceramic metal halide fixtures, and two fluorescent fixtures. The two most efficient LED and the two most efficient double-ended HPS fixtures had nearly identical efficiencies at 1.66 to 1.70 micromoles per joule. These four fixtures represent a dramatic improvement over the 1.02 micromoles per joule efficiency of the mogul-base HPS fixtures that are in common use. The best ceramic metal halide and fluorescent fixtures had efficiencies of 1.46 and 0.95 micromoles per joule, respectively. We also calculated the initial capital cost of fixtures per photon delivered and determined that LED fixtures cost five to ten times more than HPS fixtures. The five-year electric plus fixture cost per mole of photons is thus 2.3 times higher for LED fixtures, due to high capital costs. Compared to electric costs, our analysis indicates that the long-term maintenance costs are small for both technologies. If widely spaced benches are a necessary part of a production system, the unique ability of LED fixtures to efficiently focus photons on specific areas can be used to improve the photon capture by plant canopies. Our analysis demonstrates, however, that the cost per photon delivered is higher in these systems, regardless of fixture category. The lowest lighting system costs are realized when an efficient fixture is coupled with effective canopy photon capture. © 2014 Nelson, Bugbee.","","Light; Lighting; Photons; Photosynthesis; Plant Development; article; ceramic metal halide fixture; cost; economic evaluation; electrical equipment; electricity; fluorescent lighting; greenhouse; high intensity discharge fixture; high pressure sodium fixture; illumination; light emitting diode; light intensity; photon; photosynthesis; devices; economics; illumination; light; plant development","","","","","","","Bourget C.M., An introduction to light-emitting diodes, HortScience, 43, pp. 1944-1946, (2008); Morrow R.C., LED lighting in horticulture, HortScience, 43, pp. 1947-1950, (2008); Inada K., Action spectra for photosynthesis in higher plants, Plant Cell Physiol, 17, pp. 355-365, (1976); McCree K.J., The action spectrum, absorptance and quantum yield of photosynthesis in crop plants, Agric Meteorol, 9, pp. 191-216, (1972); Nelson J.A., Bugbee B., Spectral Characteristics of Lamp Types for Plant Biology West Lafayette, IN, (2013); Cope K.R., Snowden M.C., Bugbee B., Photobiological Interactions of Blue Light and Photosynthetic Photon Flux: Effects of Monochromatic and Broad-Spectrum Light Sources, Photochem Photobio, (2014); Johkan M., Shoji K., Goto F., Hahida S., Yoshihara T., Effect of green light wavelength and intensity on photomorphogenesis and photosynthesis in Lactuca sativa, Environ Exp Bot, 75, pp. 128-133, (2012); Dougher T.A.O., Bugbee B., Long-term blue light effects on the histology of lettuce and soybean leaves and stems, Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science, 129, 4, pp. 467-472, (2004); Cope K.R., Bugbee B., Spectral effects of three types of white light-emitting diodes on plant growth and development: Absolute versus relative amounts of blue light, HortScience, 48, pp. 504-509, (2013); Dougher T.A., Bugbee B., Differences in the Response of Wheat, Soybean and Lettuce to Reduced Blue Radiation¶, Photochem Photobiol, 73, pp. 199-207, (2001); Yorio N.C., Goins G.D., Kagie H.R., Wheeler R.M., Sager J.C., Improving spinach, radish, and lettuce growth under red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with blue light supplementation, HortScience, 36, 2, pp. 380-383, (2001); Yang Z.-C., Kubota C., Chia P.-L., Kacira M., Effect of end-of-day far-red light from a movable LED fixture on squash rootstock hypocotyl elongation, Sci Hortic, 136, pp. 81-86, (2012); Massa G.D., Kim H.-H., Wheeler R.M., Mitchell C.A., Plant productivity in response to LED lighting, HortScience, 43, pp. 1951-1956, (2008); Morrow R.C., Tibbitts T.W., Evidence for involvement of phytochrome in tumor development on plants, Plant Physiol, 88, pp. 1110-1114, (1988); Craig D.S., Runkle E.S., A Moderate to High Red to Far-red Light Ratio from Light-emitting Diodes Controls Flowering of Short-day Plants, J Am Soc Hortic Sci, 138, pp. 167-172, (2013); Kim H.-H., Goins G.D., Wheeler R.M., Sager J.C., Green-light supplementation for enhanced lettuce growth under red-and blue-light-emitting diodes, HortScience, 39, 7, pp. 1617-1622, (2004); IES Approved Method for the Electrical and Photometric Measurements of Solid-state Lighting Products, (2008); Blonquist M., Bugbee B., Analysis of Spectral and Cosine Errors in Quantum Sensors West Lafayette, IN, (2013); Frantz J.M., Joly R.J., Mitchell C.A., Intracanopy lighting influences radiation capture, productivity, and leaf senescence in cowpea canopies, J Am Soc Hortic Sci, 125, pp. 694-701, (2000); Gomez C., Morrow R.C., Bourget C.M., Massa G.D., Mitchell C.A., Comparison of intracanopy light-emitting diode towers and overhead high-pressure sodium lamps for supplemental lighting of greenhouse-grown tomatoes, HortTechnology, 23, pp. 93-98, (2013); Both A.J., Ciolkosz D.E., Albright L.D., Evaluation of light uniformity underneath supplemental lighting systems, Acta Hort ISHS, pp. 183-190, (2000); Ferentinos K.P., Albright L.D., Optimal design of plant lighting system by genetic algorithms, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 18, 4, pp. 473-484, (2005); Ciolkosz D.E., Both A.J., Albright L.D., Selection and placement of greenhouse luminaires for uniformity, Applied Engineering in Agriculture, 17, 6, pp. 875-882, (2001)","","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","24905835","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84902595585"

In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that the combination of171Yb+ atomic sensors with adequately trained neural networks enables us to investigate target fields in distinct challenging scenarios. In particular, we characterize radio frequency (RF) fields in the presence of large shot noise, including the limit case of continuous data acquisition via single-shot measurements. Furthermore, by incorporating neural networks we significantly extend the working regime of atomic magnetometers into scenarios in which the RF driving induces responses beyond their standard harmonic behavior. Our results indicate the benefits to integrate neural networks at the data processing stage of general quantum sensing tasks to decipher the information contained in the sensor responses. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Data acquisition; Data handling; Shot noise; Atomic magnetometers; Atomic sensors; Continuous data; Exposed to; Neural-networks; Radio frequency fields; Radiofrequencies; Single-shot measurements; Target fields; Trained neural networks; Magnetometers","","","","","Dispositivos en Tecnologías Cuánticas, (IT1470-22, KK-2022/00062); Hacia una especialización armonizada en tecnologías cuánticas en BRTA, (KK-2022/00041); Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0301200, 2021ZD0301604); Ramón y Cajal, (RYC2018-025197-I); Spanish Government, (EUR2020-112117, PID2021-126694NB-C21); Students’ Innovation and Entrepreneurship Foundation of USTC, (828826); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11734015, 11774335); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (QYZDY-SSWSLH003); Eusko Jaurlaritza, (KK-2021/00070); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFA0304100)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2017YFA0304100), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 11774335 and 11734015), the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (No. QYZDY-SSWSLH003), Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology (Nos. 2021ZD0301604 and 2021ZD0301200).

A digital canopy model (DCM), which is calculated by subtracting a digital terrain model (DTM) from a digital surface model (DSM) of the vegetation, provides useful information for studies of wild animal habitats and plant species distributions. However, DCMs have been used mainly for forests, and their validity for herbaceous plants requires further verification. In this study, we used the ADS40 airborne digital sensor to clarify the relationship between a DCM and the height of herbaceous species. Our study area was the Watarase wetland in the northern Kanto Plain, central Japan. Suitable habitats for the many rare plants found in this wetland are maintained by controlled burning in early spring. We acquired three DSMs: just after the controlled burn in April 2006; in August 2006, when the vegetation height peaked; and in April 2007, also just after the controlled burn. We calculated the DCM based on the difference between the August DSM and a DTM developed by using the minimum height values from the two April DSMs. We also performed a field survey during the August DSM acquisition, during which we measured the height of the uppermost leaves with a measuring pole at 16 measurement points and estimated the vegetation structure from photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) profiles measured with quantum sensors at each point. The calculated DCM height correlated very well to the height of the uppermost leaves (r2=0.96), although it was about 100 cm lower. In contrast, the DCM and the height of maximum intercepted PPFD were highly correlated (r2=0.97) and showed a 1:1 relationship. © 2010, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

Recently, a new type of condensate has been observed - the photon BEC, where light in a dye-filled cavity thermalizes with dye molecules under the influence of an external driving laser, condensing to the lowest-energy mode. Here, we consider medium-induced symmetry breaking in a photon BEC and show that it can be used as a quantum sensor. The introduction of polarizable objects such as chiral molecules lifts the degeneracy between cavity modes of different polarizations. Even a tiny imbalance is imprinted on the condensate polarization, in a ""winner-takes-it-all"" effect. When used as a sensor for enantiomeric excess, the predicted sensitivity exceeds that of contemporary methods based on circular dichroism. Our results introduce a symmetry-breaking mechanism that is independent of the external pump and demonstrate that the photon BEC can be used for practical purposes. © 2020 American Physical Society.","","Bose-Einstein condensation; Dichroism; Molecules; Photons; Polarization; Statistical mechanics; Bose-Einstein condensates; Chiral molecule; Enantiomeric excess; External driving; Macroscopic levels; Quantum effects; Quantum sensors; Symmetry-breaking; Stereochemistry","","","","","Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (BU 1803/3-1476)","We thank Henry Hesten, Robert Nyman, Andreas Buchleitner, and Akbar Salam for fruitful exchanges.

In the life sciences, diamond-based quantum sensing has led to a new class of biophysical sensors and diagnostic devices that are being investigated as a platform for cancer screening and ultrasensitive immunoassays. However, a broader application in the life sciences based on nanoscale NMR spectroscopy has been hampered by the need to interface highly sensitive quantum bit (qubit) sensors with their biological targets. Here, we demonstrate an approach that combines quantum engineering with single-molecule biophysics to immobilize individual proteins and DNA molecules on the surface of a bulk diamond crystal that hosts coherent nitrogen vacancy qubit sensors. Our thin (sub-5 nm) functionalization architecture provides precise control over the biomolecule adsorption density and results in near-surface qubit coherence approaching 100 μs. The developed architecture remains chemically stable under physiological conditions for over 5 d, making our technique compatible with most biophysical and biomedical applications. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

Solid-state electronic spins offer a unique platform to implement high-performance quantum sensing devices, which address this need and go beyond what classical technologies offer. We present a robust technology to realise this concept, which is based on nano-engineered diamond devices, hosting single electronic spins for sensing. We will describe the key principles underlying these novel quantum sensors and discuss some of their areas of applications which we have opened over the last years. These include the field of antiferromagnetic spintronics, where single spin magnetometry already yields unprecedented insight into domain formation and non-trivial spin-textures in antiferromagnets. Next to these room-temperature applications, we will present results of cryogenic single spin magnetometry for quantitative, high resolution imaging of vortices and supercurrents in nanoscale superconductors. These examples illustrate the remarkable performance that single spin quantum sensing offers, and which holds great promise for future applications in various applicatons of the nano-sciences. © 2018 IEEE.","antiferromagnets; measurement techniques; precision measurements; Quantum sensing; scanning probe; single spins; spintronics; uncertainty","Antiferromagnetic materials; Magnetometers; Nanosensors; Nanotechnology; Quantum theory; Spintronics; Superconducting materials; Uncertainty analysis; Antiferromagnets; Measurement techniques; Precision measurement; Quantum sensing; Scanning probes; Single spin; uncertainty; Magnetometry","","","","","Swiss Nanoscience Institute, SNI, (143697, 169321); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; Stavros Niarchos Foundation, SNF; National Center of Competence in Research Quantum Science and Technology, NCCR QSIT","Funding text 1: The author acknowledges discussions with Vincent Jacques and funding from NCCR QSIT; a competence center funded by SNF; the Swiss Nanoscience Institute (SNI); and through SNF Projects 143697 and 169321.; Funding text 2: ACKNOWLEDGMENT The author acknowledges discussions with Vincent Jacques and funding from NCCR QSIT; a competence center funded by SNF; the Swiss Nanoscience Institute (SNI); and through SNF Projects 143697 and 169321.","Chernobrod B.M., Berman G.P., J.

Moreover, it is also required that the PLLs should have low noise and low jitter for high stability and fast settling time. These requirements seek low phase noise voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) with small variation in its gain (KVCO) within the desired tuning range. In this paper, we present a technique for designing a low phase noise VCO with low KVCO and small KVCO variation. To validate the proposed technique, an LC VCO has been designed and implemented in 0.18 μ m CMOS process and post layout simulation results are presented. The simulation results show that the proposed LC VCO achieves KVCO variation of ±3.82% in the frequency range of 2.75 - 2.94 GHz and exhibits a phase noise of -118.64 dBc/Hz at an offset of 1 MHz, while consuming 9 mW of power from a 1.8 V supply.  © 2022 IEEE.","KVCO variation; low phase noise; oscillator; quantum sensing; VCO","Circuit oscillations; Oscillistors; Phase locked loops; Phase noise; Gain variations; KVCO variation; Low-phase-noise; Microwaves frequency; Narrow bands; Nitrogen vacancies; Noise voltage; Quantum sensing; Sensing applications; Voltage-controlled-oscillator; Variable frequency oscillators","","","","","","","Ibrahim M.I., Foy C., Englund D.R., Han R., High-Scalability cmos Quantum Magnetometer With Spin-State Excitation and Detection of Diamond Color Centers, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, 56, 3, pp. 1001-1014, (2021); Kim D., Ibrahim M.I., Foy C., Trusheim M.E., Han R., En-Glund D.R., A CMOS-Integrated Quantum Sensor based on Nitrogen-Vacancy Centres, Nature Electron., 2, 7, pp. 284-289, (2019); Razavi B., Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits, (2001); Razavi B., RF Microelectronics, (1997); Luo J., Zhang L., Zhang L., Wang Y., Yu Z., A 24GHz Low Power and Low Phase Noise pll Frequency Synthesizer with Constant kvco for 60GHz Wireless Applications, Proc.

Researchers in these fields require tools to measure the high-speed motion and heat simultaneously. Ultra-high frame rate imaging is achieved by an in-situ storage image sensor. Each pixel of the sensor is equipped with multiple memory elements to record a series of image signals simultaneously at all pixels. Image signals stored in each pixel are read out after an image capturing operation. In 2002, we developed an in-situ storage image sensor operating at 1 Mfps 1). However, the fill factor of the sensor was only 15% due to a light shield covering the wide in-situ storage area. Therefore, in 2011, we developed a backside illuminated (BSI) in-situ storage image sensor to increase the sensitivity with 100% fill factor and a very high quantum efficiency 2). The sensor also achieved a much higher frame rate,16.7 Mfps, thanks to the wiring on the front side with more freedom 3). The BSI structure has another advantage that it has less difficulties in attaching an additional layer on the backside, such as scintillators. This paper proposes development of an ultra-high-speed IR image sensor in combination of advanced nano-Technologies for IR imaging and the in-situ storage technology for ultra-highspeed imaging with discussion on issues in the integration. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The fundamental component of our scheme is the quantum circuit (QC), a linear network that optimally distributes the squeezing generated at one of its inputs among the d MZIs, where d unknown parameters θ1, . . ., θd are then imprinted and the number of photons at the outputs finally measured. For any given linear combination of the parameters, we can optimize the QC and achieve sub-shot-noise sensitivity. Our parallel strategy, based on the mode-entanglement created by the QC, outperforms the rival and more common sequential strategy, in which the same unknown parameters are estimated independently. It also saturates the ultimate sensitivity bound, the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, in a relevant regime of parameters, thus constituting an optimal estimation method in that regime. © 2023 SPIE.","distributed quantum sensing; entanglement; interferometry; Quantum phase estimation","Linear networks; Parameter estimation; Quantum optics; Shot noise; Distributed quantum sensing; Entanglement; Estimation theory; Fundamental component; Linear combinations; Multiphases; Phase-estimation; Quantum circuit; Quantum phase estimation; Squeezed state; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Loudon R., Knight P.

A laser with a large volume seriously hampers the integration and performance of magnetometers. To solve this problem, we proposed a 520-nm laser diode with an integrated NV magnetometer. The 520-nm laser diode has a high excitation efficiency and good performance with a small size. We introduced the key steps of designing an integrated magnetometer head and tested the performance, a magnetic field sensitivity of 20.77\,\,{n}T\,\,\cdot \,\,Hz{-1/2} , and a shot noise sensitivity of 1.43\,\,{n}T\,\,\cdot \,\,Hz {-1/2}. The measurable magnetic field range is from -107 to 107\mu \text{T} , the system bandwidth is 15 Hz at the laser power of 10 mW, and the magnetic field conversion coefficient is 16.88 V/T. Thus, this paper provides a new method to minimise the light source volume and integrate it with a NV magnetometer. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","integrated magnetometer; laser diode; magnetic field sensitivity; NV center","Diodes; Laser excitation; Light sources; Magnetic field measurement; Magnetic fields; Magnetometers; Semiconductor lasers; Shot noise; Superconducting magnets; Diode-laser; High potential; Integrated magnetometer; Magnetic field sensitivity; Magnetic fields measurements; Magnetic noise; Magnetic-field; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Performance; Diamonds","","","","","","","Grosz A., Haji-Sheikh M.J., Mukhopadhyay S.C., High Sensitivity Magnetometers, 19, (2017); Budker D., Romalis M., Optical magnetometry, Nature Phys, 3, pp. 227-234, (2007); Dang H.B., Maloof A.C., Romalis M.V., Ultrahigh sensitivity magnetic field and magnetization measurements with an atomic magnetometer, Appl.

Among them, magnetometers based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds are promising room-temperature solid-state sensors. Their sensitivity to low-frequency (< 10 Hz) magnetic fields has been reported to be currently at the nanotesla level. Still, limitations in the detectable spatial range hinder their potential applications in medical imaging, earth sciences, and navigation. The most recent sensitivity enhancement technique involves using high-permeability flux concentrators with a unique magnetic field amplification structure that can cause the NV magnetometer to lose its vector detection capabilities. To address this limitation, we proposed a hybrid magnetometer based on a diamond-based hetero-NV center, which collects magnetic flux over a larger area and concentrates it in the diamond magnetometer, from which the magnetic field vector can be calculated by measuring the specific magnetic field direction vector. The low-frequency sensitivity of 90 pT $\cdot $ Hz $^{{(!{-}!){1}/{2}}}$ under conventional ambient conditions has been solved by inserting NV-doped diamond blocks between four permalloy concentrators in a triangular structure, which solves the vector deficiency problem of traditional magnetic concentrators. High-sensitivity real-time variation acquisition of the magnetic field signal has been achieved by applying an ac magnetic field in combination with modulation and demodulation methods. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Diamond magnetometer; flux concentrator; magnetic field sensitivity; nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center; quantum sensing","Diamonds; Hybrid materials; Iron alloys; Magnetic field measurement; Magnetic flux; Magnetometers; Medical imaging; Nickel alloys; Sensitivity analysis; Vectors; Diamond magnetometer; Flux concentrator; Lower frequencies; Magnetic field sensitivity; Magnetic fields measurements; Magnetic-field; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Quantum sensing; Vector resolutions; Magnetic fields","","","","","Excellent Youth Foundation of Shanxi Scientific Committee, (20210302121007); Fund for Shanxi ""1331 Project, (1331KSC); NSMFC, (51727808, 51922009, 61874100, 62220106012); SXNSF, (201803D421037, 201903D121128); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YMFC2204104)","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2022YMFC2204104; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSMFC) under Grant 62220106012, Grant 51727808, Grant 61874100, and Grant 51922009; in part by the Fund for Shanxi ""1331 Project""Key Subjects Construction under Grant 1331KSC; in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi (SXNSF) under Grant 201903D121128 and Grant 201803D421037; and in part by the Excellent Youth Foundation of Shanxi Scientific Committee under Grant 20210302121007.","Cohen D., Magnetic fields around the torso: Production by electrical activity of the human heart, Science, 156, 3775, pp. 652-654, (1967); Lenz J., Edelstein A.S., Magnetic sensors and their applications, IEEE Sensors J, 6, 3, pp. 631-649, (2006); Tanaka S., Kitamura Y., Uchida Y., Hatsukade Y., Ohtani T., Suzuki S., Development of metallic contaminant detection system using eight-channel high-T<sub>c</sub> SQUIDs, IEEE Trans.

This is because the battery current of EVs can reach a maximum of several hundred amperes while the average current is only approximately 10 A, and ordinary sensors do not have an accuracy of several tens of milliamperes while maintaining a dynamic range of several hundred amperes. Therefore, the state of charge has to be estimated with an ambiguity of approximately 10%, which makes the battery usage inefficient. This study resolves this limitation by developing a diamond quantum sensor with an inherently wide dynamic range and high sensitivity for measuring the battery current. The design uses the differential detection of two sensors to eliminate in-vehicle common-mode environmental noise, and a mixed analog–digital control to trace the magnetic resonance microwave frequencies of the quantum sensor without deviation over a wide dynamic range. The prototype battery monitor was fabricated and tested. The battery module current was measured up to 130 A covering WLTC driving pattern, and the accuracy of the current sensor to estimate battery state of charge was analyzed to be 10 mA, which will lead to 0.2% CO2 reduction emitted in the 2030 WW transportation field. Moreover, an operating temperature range of − 40 to + 85 °C and a maximum current dynamic range of ± 1000 A were confirmed. © 2022, The Author(s).","","","","","","","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (JPMXS0118067395)","This work was supported by the MEXT Q-LEAP (JPMXS0118067395).

The result improves the previous fiber guided atom interferometer sensitivity by three orders of magnitude. The improvement arises from the realization of in-fiber Λ-enhanced gray molasses and delta-kick cooling to cool atoms from 32μK to below 1μK in 4 ms. The in-fiber cooling overcomes the inevitable heating during the atom loading process and allows a shallow guiding optical potential to minimize decoherence. Our results permit bringing atoms close to source fields for sensing and could lead to compact inertial quantum sensors with a submillimeter resolution.  © 2022 authors.

The fundamental physics research program currently supports research in four areas: gravitational and relativistic physics, laser cooling and atomic physics, low temperature and condensed matter physics, and biological physics. The microgravity fundamental physics is one of the science disciplines within the new NASA Office of Biological and Physical Sciences Research, where quantum technology plays a major role. Quantum technology, based on controlled manipulation of fundamentally quantum processes of atoms, molecules, or soft matter, enables novel and significantly extended capabilities.

One way to achieve this precision is to use focused ion beams and verify the implantation of each ion by detecting the charge it induces in the semiconductor. This method has already been demonstrated for silicon substrates but has yet to be successfully performed for wide-bandgap materials. One of the most promising materials for future quantum devices is a diamond. Quantum centers in diamond, such as nitrogen vacancies, can serve as information carriers in quantum computers - qubits - and are stable at room temperature. This work focuses on understanding the critical parameters required for the successful detection of shallow, low-energy ions in diamonds using commercially available diamond crystals and front-end electronics. Depth profiling of the electric field in the diamond crystal was performed using ions of different species and energy. State-of-the-art front-end electronics were also used to achieve high energy resolution. Using the XGLab CUBE PRE031 preamplifier, an energy resolution of 6 keV was achieved for the detection of 400-keV protons. Detection of 140-keV copper ions, penetrating an average of 100 nm into the diamond, was also demonstrated. The optimal position of implantation sites was determined from the spatial distribution of charge collection efficiency.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Deterministic implantation; diamond detectors; ion beam-induced charge (IBIC); single-ion detection","Diamonds; Electric fields; Ion beams; Ion implantation; Metal ions; Silicon; Deterministic implantation; Deterministics; Diamond crystals; Diamond detectors; Front end; High-precision; IBIC; Quantum device; Single ion detection; Single-ion implantation; Temperature measurement","","","","","","","Schenkel T., Et al., Single ion implantation for solid state quantum computer development, J.

The exponential description of direct and diffuse radiation penetration, which depends on leaf inclination, was correlated to the transmission measurements at various solar zenith angles. The highest correlations were found for fixed leaf inclinations of 60 and 75°, and for the spherical leaf angle distribution. Angular shape coefficients corresponding to these leaf inclinations were then used to solve the exponential equation for LAI taking incoming PAR to be direct. This was shown to be an acceptable approximation when the proportion of direct radiation in the incoming PAR was higher than 0.85. Predictions of LAI were found to be within 0.7 units for a range of LAI from 1.5 to 5.0. A statistical analysis of the results indicated that the most suitable leaf inclination was a combination of 60 and 75° fixed angles, and spherical distribution. © 1984.","","","","","","","","","Anderson, Interpreting the fraction of solar radiation available in forest, Agri.

Recently it was realized that for classical signals, precision and resolution of quantum spectroscopy is limited mainly by coherence of the signal and the stability of the clock used to measure time. The coherence time of the quantum probe, which can be significantly shorter, is not a major limiting factor in resolution measurements. Here, we address a similar question for spectroscopy of quantum signals, for example, a quantum sensor is used to detect a single nuclear spin. We present and analyze a novel correlation spectroscopy technique with performance that is limited by the coherence time of the target spins and the stability of the clock. © 2018 American Physical Society.","","Clocks; Classical clocks; Coherence time; Correlation spectroscopy; Nuclear spins; Quantum sensors; Quantum signals; Resolution measurements; Two-level system; Quantum theory","","","","","European Commission, EC; Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, (1287/15); Israel Science Foundation, ISF, (039-8823)"," We thank Amit Rotem, Daniel Louzon and Nati Aharon for fruitful discussions.

The single electron spin of a near-surface nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond is used as the quantum sensor, and a fused-silica half-sphere lens is taken as the source of the moving nucleons. The exotic interaction between the polarized electron and the moving nucleon source is explored by measuring the possible magnetic field sensed by the electron spin quantum sensor. Our experiment sets improved constraints on the exotic spin- and velocity-dependent interaction within the force range from 1.4 to 330 μm.

But as the photons transporting in atmosphere, the environmental interaction causes quantum de-coherence and results in the reduction of super-sensitivity range of the quantum sensors. The most significant effect of atmospheric transmission is photon loss along with phase fluctuation. In this letter, we introduce both the photon loss and phase fluctuation by adding a fictitious beam splitter in the signal arm of Mach- Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The density matrix with N00N and M&M' entangled states being the input states under the condition of photon loss and phase fluctuation is given respectively. Then as the optimal detection schemes parity operator is used as the detector and the formula of the sensitivity is derived. The super-sensitivity range of M&M' and N00N states with de-coherence are simulated. As a consequence, with high photon loss M&M' states shows the better phase sensitivity than N00N states but the N00N state is better when the loss is smaller than 20%. And with pure phase fluctuations N00N states get the longer range. M&M' states is sensitive to the transmittance difference between two arms of the interferometer. © 2015 SPIE.","atmosphere transmission; Mach-Zehnder interferometer; quantum de-coherence; quantum sensing","Interferometers; Light; Mach-Zehnder interferometers; Optical radar; Optical testing; Photons; Quantum entanglement; Atmospheric transmissions; Environmental interactions; Machzehnder interferometers (MZI); Optimal detection; Phase fluctuation; Phase sensitivity; quantum sensing; Standard quantum limits; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Zerom P., Chan K.W.C., Howell J.C., Et al., Entangled-photon compressive ghost imaging, Physical Review A, 84, 6, pp. 14717-14719, (2011); Peng C.Z., Yang T., Bao X.H., Et al., Experimental free-space distribution of entangled photon pairs over 13 km: Towards satellite-based global quantum communication, Physical Review Letters, 94, 5, (2005); Rozema L.A., Bateman J.D., Mahler D.H., Et al., Scalable spatial superresolution using entangled photons, Physical Review Letters, 112, 22, pp. 770-777, (2014); Dorner U., Demkowicz-Dobrzanski R., Smith B.J., Et al., Optimal Quantum Phase Estimation, (2008); Kok P., Lee H., Dowling J.P., Creation of large-photon-number path entanglement conditioned on photodetection, Physical Review A, 65, 5, pp. 882-886, (2001); O'Brien J.L., Pryde G.J., Gilchrist A., Et al., Quantum process tomography of a controlled- NOT gate, Phys.rev.lett, 93, 8, pp. 8193-8195, (2004); Mitchell M.W., Lundeen J.S., Steinberg A.M., Super-resolving phase measurements with a multiphoton entangled state, Nature, 429, 6988, pp. 161-164, (2004); Huver S., Wildfeuer C., Dowling J., Entangled Fock states for robust quantum optical metrology, imaging, and sensing, Physical Review A, 78, 6, pp. 063828-063834, (2008); Bardhan B.R., Jiang K., Dowling J.P., Effects of phase fluctuations on phase sensitivity and visibility of path-entangled photon fock states, Phys.rev.a, 88, 2, pp. 195-201, (2013); Bardhan B.R., Dowling J.P., Effects of phase fluctuations on the sensitivity of NOON state in a noisy environment, Conference on Coherence and Quantum Optics, M6, 19, (2013); Chiruvelli A., Lee H., Parity Measurements in Quantum Optical Metrology, (2009); Gerry C., Mimih J., The parity operator in quantum optical metrology, Contemporary Physics, 51, 6, pp. 497-511, (2010); Andrews L.C., Phillips R.L., Laser beam propagation through random media, Storage and Retrieval for Image and Video Databases, (2005); Bollinger J.J., Itano W.M., Winel D.J., Et al., Optimal frequency measurements with maximally correlated states, Physical Review A, 54, 6, pp. R4649-R4652, (1996); Gerry C.C., Heisenberg-limit interferometry with four-wave mixers operating in a nonlinear regime, Phys, "" Rev A, (2000); Jiang K., Brignac C.J., Weng Y., Et al., Strategies for choosing path-entangled number states for optimal robust quantum optical metrology in the presence of loss, Phys.rev.a, 86, 1, pp. 1934-1935, (2012); Bohmann M., Sperling J., Vogel W., Entanglement and Phase Properties of Noisy N00N States, (2014); Ruizhong R., Light Propagation in the Turbulent Atmosphere, (2005)","","Ellis J.D.; Guo Y.; Han S.; Guo J.","SPIE","Chinese Society for Optical Engineering","Applied Optics and Photonics, China: Optical Test, Measurement, and Equipment, AOPC 2015","5 May 2015 through 7 May 2015","Beijing","117015","0277786X","978-162841902-3","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84950335579"

At the same time, the FPGA-based environmental control system realizes the closed-loop control of RPFD, BPFD and PPFD by reading the data collected by the MPS that slides up and down according to the height of the canopy of the plant and using the PWM signal to control the LED light board's red and blue channel. Based on the above method, the article completed an Artificial Climate Chamber (ACC) that realizes the automatic regulation of PPFD and RPFD/BPFD (R/B) of plant canopy that are the key parameters for determining the light formulations of plant lighting and environmental parameters including temperature, relative humidity, CO2 concentration, photoperiod etc. At a significantly lower cost, the MPS's photon response curve is close to the ideal value, and the linear response R2 of the calibration exceeds 0.999. After setting the parameters for 30 s, the RPFD, BPFD and PPFD control error of the ACC are 1.43%, 1.39% and 0.71%, respectively. The paper also used tea seedlings as materials to explore the physiological and biochemical indexes of leaves under different R/B and PPFD.

The PAR measurements are carried out within wavelength ranges 380-710 nm and 400-700 nm using modified thermoelectrically pyranometer (1980-2001) and LI-COR quantum sensor (from 1999 to the present) with the accuracy 7-10%. Main attention was paid to the variability of the magnitude of the relationship between the broadband total solar radiation (Q) and PAR (QPAR). The dependence of this ratio (qPAR=QPAR/Q) on various meteorological factors is investigated. The simple empirically derived model for PAR estimation is developed. Based on these methods the long-term variations of PAR during the XX Century in the Moscow region was obtained. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.","Aerosol impact on PAR; Cloud amount impact on PAR; Empirical parameterization; Monitoring; Photosynthetically active radiation or PAR; Sunshine duration; Total solar radiation","","","","","","","","Jacovides C.P., Tymvios F.S., Assimakopoulos V.D., Kaltsounides N.A., Agric.

Quantum sensors can for instance be afflicted with erasure errors. Here, we consider using quantum probe states with a structure that corresponds to classical [n,k,d] binary block codes of minimum distance d≥t+1. We obtain bounds on the ultimate precision that these probe states can give for estimating the unknown magnitude of a classical field after at most t qubits of the quantum probe state are erased. We show that the quantum Fisher information is proportional to the variances of the weight distributions of the corresponding 2t shortened codes. If the shortened codes of a fixed code with d≥t+1 have a nontrivial weight distribution, then the probe states obtained by concatenating this code with repetition codes of increasing length enable asymptotically optimal field sensing that passively tolerates up to t erasure errors.  © 2023 American Physical Society.","","Codes (symbols); Errors; Fisher information matrix; Optimal systems; Quantum noise; Quantum theory; Binary block codes; Classical fields; Erasure error; Minimums distance; Performance; Quantum metrology; Quantum probe; Quantum sensors; Quantum technologies; Weight distributions; Probes","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1718494, 1908730); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/M024261/1, EP/R043825/1); National University of Singapore, NUS, (R-263-000-E32-133, R-263-000-E32-731); National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE","Y.O. acknowledges support from EPSRC (Grant No. EP/M024261/1) and the QCDA project (Grant No. EP/R043825/1) which has received funding from the QuantERA ERANET Cofund in Quantum Technologies implemented within the European Union's Horizon 2020 Programme.

Although this provides important ecophysiological information, it is often necessary to learn more about the potential intrinsic capacities of leaves by measuring light-response curves. Thus, instruments provide light-curve programmes, where light intensities are increased in short intervals and instant light-response curves are recorded within a few minutes. This method can be criticized because photosynthesis will most likely not be in steady state. This technical report shows that with the appropriate precautions instant light curves can nevertheless provide reliable information about cardinal points of photosynthesis. First, the geometry of the light source of the instrument in relation to the quantum sensor must be considered and quantum sensor readings must be corrected. Second, the measurements of the light-response curves must be compared with readings of effective quantum yield of photosystem II under ambient light conditions where photosynthesis is in steady state. This may show that in the critical range of the light curves either both measurements perfectly coincide or are offset against each other by a constant value (examples are given here). In the first case results of light curves can be taken at face values, and in the second case a simple correction can be applied. With these precautions and careful interpretations instant light-response curves can be an enormous advantage in ecophysiological field work.","Cardinal points; Chlorophyll a fluorescence; Light reaction; Photosynthesis; Photosystem II; Pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer (Mini-PAM); Quantum yield; Steady state","","","","","","","","Bilger W., Schreiber U., Bock M., Determination of the quantum efficiency of photosystem II and of non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence in the field, Oecologia, 102, pp. 425-432, (1995); Ehleringer J., Leaf absorptances of Mohave and Sonoran desert plants, Oecologia, 49, pp. 366-370, (1981); Franco A.C., Herzog B., Hubner C., De Mattos E.A., Scarano F.R., Ball E., Luttge U., Diurnal changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence, CO<sub>2</sub>-exchange and organic acid decarboxylation in the tropical CAM tree Clusia hilariana, Tree Physiology, 19, pp. 635-644, (1999); Genty B., Briantais J.M., Baker N.R., The relationship between the quantum yield of photosynthetic electron transport and quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 990, pp. 87-92, (1989); Kluge M., Brulfert J., Lipp J., Ravelomanana D., Ziegler H., A comparative study by δ<sup>13</sup>C-analysis of crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) in Kalanchoë (Crassulaceae) species of Africa and Madagascar, Botanica Acta, 106, pp. 320-324, (1993); Luttge U., Haridasan M., Fernandes G.W., De Mattos E.A., Trimborn P., Franco A.C., Caldas L.S., Ziegler H., Photosynthesis of mistletoes in relation to their hosts at various sites in tropical Brazil, Trees, 12, pp. 167-174, (1998); De Mattos E.A., Grams T.E.E., Ball E., Franco A.C., Haag-Kerwer A., Herzog B., Scarano F.R., Luttge U., Diurnal pattern of chlorophyll a fluorescence and stomatal conductance in species of two types of coastal tree vegetation in southeastern Brazil, Trees, 11, pp. 363-369, (1997); Schreiber U., Bilger W., Progress in chlorophyll fluorescence research: Major developments during the past years in retrospect, Progress in Botany, 54, pp. 151-173, (1993); Schreiber U., Bilger W., Neubauer C., Chlorophyll fluorescence as a nonintrusive indicator for rapid assessment of vivo photosynthesis, pp. 49-70, (1995); Schulze E.-D., Beck E., Scheibe R., Ziegler P., Carbon dioxide assimilation and stomatal response of afroalpine giant rosette plants, Oecologia, 65, pp. 207-213, (1985); Thiele A., Krause G.H., Xanthophyll cycle and thermal energy dissipation in photosystem II: Relationship between zeaxanthin formation, energy-dependent fluorescence quenching and photoinhibition, Journal of Plant Physiology, 144, pp. 324-332, (1994); Thiele A., Krause G.H., Winter K., In situ study of photo-inhibition of photosynthesis and xanthopyll cycle activity in plants growing in natural gaps of the tropical forest, Australian Journal of Plant Physiology, 25, pp. 189-195, (1998)","U.

The system consisted of a closed transparent polycarbonate box that allowed measurements of climate and whole plant photosynthesis. Inside the box, air temperature, irradiance, relative humidity, CO2 concentration, and CO2 injection rate were measured and controlled. A connected PC running software developed by the project collected data from sensors, performed climate control, stored all data in a Paradox database, managed different experiments, calculated photosynthesis, and displayed all results in real time by means of a graphical user interface. New sensors and mathematical models were easily integrated.

We develop a new model that makes estimates using only general meteorological data-solar radiation, atmospheric pressure, air temperature, and relative humidity. Root mean square deviations for eight datasets at five sites in Japan were smaller than 5.2 %, similar to error in other studies and to individual differences of quantum sensors. Most root mean square deviations of nine previous models and our eight datasets are larger than that of the new estimation model, which performed well. This suggests that the model is useful for estimating photosynthetically active radiation in a temperate, humid area of Japan. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.","","Japan; air temperature; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pressure; photosynthetically active radiation; relative humidity; solar radiation","","","","","Global Environment Research Account for National Institutes; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (24310017, 25241002)","We are grateful to Dr. Takashi Nakano and other members of the Yamanashi Institute of Environmental Science for the help in managing the Fujiyoshida site.

Observation of free induction decays is an essential ingredient for high resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance, and the present work extends it to the atomic scale.

Quantum sensors based on optically addressable spin defects in bulk semiconductors are typically employed for such purposes, but the 3D crystal structure of the sensor inhibits sensitivity by limiting the proximity of the defects to the target spins. Here we demonstrate the detection of paramagnetic spins using spin defects hosted in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a van der Waals material that can be exfoliated into the 2D regime. We first create negatively charged boron vacancy (VB−) defects in a powder of ultrathin hBN nanoflakes (<10 atomic monolayers thick on average) and measure the longitudinal spin relaxation time (T1) of this system. We then decorate the dry hBN nanopowder with paramagnetic Gd3+ ions and observe a clear T1 quenching under ambient conditions, consistent with the added magnetic noise. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of performing spin measurements, including T1 relaxometry using solution-suspended hBN nanopowder. Our results highlight the potential and versatility of the hBN quantum sensor for a range of sensing applications and make steps toward the realization of a truly 2D, ultrasensitive quantum sensor. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","boron vacancy; hexagonal boron nitride; magnetic noise; quantum sensing; spin relaxation; van der Waals","Boron nitride; Crystal structure; Defects; Nanostructured materials; Nitrides; Paramagnetism; Van der Waals forces; Boron vacancy; Hexagonal boron nitride; Magnetic noise; Nano powders; Paramagnetic spins; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Spin relaxation; Ultra-thin; Van der Waal; III-V semiconductors","","","","","RMIT Microscopy and Microanalysis Facility; Office of Naval Research Global, ONRG, (N62909-22-1-2028); Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, MNRF; Australian Research Council, ARC, (CE170100012, CE200100010, DE200100279, DP220100178, FT200100073, FT220100053); RMIT University, RMIT; National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology, QST","This work was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC) through grants CE170100012, CE200100010, FT200100073, DE200100279, DP220100178, and FT220100053 and by the Office of Naval Research Global (N62909-22-1-2028).

A promising approach to improve these quantum sensors is to convert environment spins into useful resources for sensing, in particular, entangled states. However, the sensitivity enhancement that can be achieved from entangled states is limited by experimental constraints, such as control errors, decoherence, and time overheads. Here we experimentally demonstrate the efficient use of an unknown electronic spin defect in the proximity of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond to achieve both an entangled quantum sensor and a quantum memory for readout. We show that, whereas entanglement alone does not provide an enhancement in sensitivity, combining both entanglement and repetitive readout achieves an enhancement in performance over the use of a single-spin sensor, and more broadly we discuss regimes where sensitivity could be enhanced. Our results critically highlight the challenges in improving quantum sensors using entangled states of electronic spins, while providing an important benchmark in the quest for entanglement-assisted metrology. © 2019 American Physical Society.","","Defects; Solid-state sensors; Control errors; Electronic spins; Entangled state; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Quantum memory; Quantum sensors; Sensitivity enhancements; Single spin; Quantum entanglement","","","","","National Sleep Foundation, NSF, (EECS1702716, PHY1415345); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","This work was in part supported by NSF Grants No. PHY1415345 and No. EECS1702716.

Photothermal heating can limit the utility of NV- center nanodiamonds, especially under high laser irradiances4-6. A composite of nanodiamonds with NV- defects and ytterbium-doped cubic sodium yttrium fluoride (Yb:α-NaYF4 or NaYF) could offset the photothermal heating of nanodiamonds by the anti-Stokes fluorescence cooling of Yb3+ ions7. We present a novel preparation method for generating a NV- diamond NaYF composite material based on a hydrothermal synthesis approach. Particle size was determined to be 230 ± 90 nm by SEM, and DLS data show a permanent connection between nanodiamonds and NaYF. Nanodiamonds are observed on the surfaces of NaYF materials. Nanodiamonds may also be incorporated within the body of individual NaYF grains, however the question of whether nanodiamonds are fully incorporated into the host NaYF material remains to be answered. The temperatures of host material and NV- defects are accessed using mean fluorescence wavelength shifts and Debye-Waller factor thermometry respectively. The obtained temperature changes with increasing 1020 nm irradiance show good agreement. Two data sets showed photothermal heating of around 10 and 13 K at 6.3 MW/cm2. Increased particle smoothness and sizes could lead to coolable composite materials.

Most of these experiments use standard ConFlat (CF) flanges for the design of the UHV system. One of the biggest challenges for these vacuum systems during a space mission is the mechanical loads. These loads are applied during launch, stage separation, etc., as a combination of static and dynamic loads. When loads are applied, the UHV system can experience an increased leakage rate, which decreases the vacuum quality. Investigation of the rise of the leakage rate due to static loads is an important step to allow a proper design process of space suitable UHV systems. In this paper, CF DN40 flange connections will be experimentally tested for standard aluminum (AluVaC) and stainless steel (316LN-ESR, 14429-ESU) tubes. Additionally, three different bolt pretension torques of 10, 12.5, and 15 N m are tested and compared. The presented results can be used to improve the design and assembly procedure for future UHV systems, such as the MAIUS (Matter-Wave Interferometry under Microgravity) sounding rocket missions.  © 2021 Author(s).","","Dynamic loads; Conflat flanges; Leakage rates; Mechanical loads; Optical experiments; Quantum sensors; Rate detection; Scientific mission; Space missions; Steel flanges; Ultrahigh vacuum system; Flanges","","","","","German Space Agency; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie, BMWi; Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt, DLR; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi","This project was realized within the QUANTUS IV—MAIUS project, which is supported by the German Space Agency (DLR) with funds provided by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) under Grant No. DLR 50WP 1431.

Red/far-red (R/FR) ratios and temperatures beneath the forest plantations were also measured. The species studied were: Eucalyptus globulus, Pinus patula, Cupressus lusitanica, Grevillea robusta, and Juniperus procera. The canopies of E. globulus, P. patula and G. robusta transmitted about three times as much PPFD as J. procera or C. lusitanica plantations. Furthermore, plantations of G. robusta and E. globulus had the highest, while J. procera had the lowest R/FR ratio. In contrast to J. procera and C. lusitanica, E. globulus and G. robusta had relatively open crowns, higher crown-bases and lower leaf area indices, and as a result, their canopies had higher PPFD transmittance percentages as well as higher below-canopy R/FR ratios and temperatures. From the perspective of understory light regime, plantations of E. globulus and G. robusta are best suited for promoting the natural regeneration of native species. In general, opening of gaps in plantations of heavy-shading tree species may increase the herbaceous layer ground cover, enhance the colonisation and growth of native woody species and consequently may also increase the floristic diversity of mono-specific plantations. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In applications where the magnetic field may be changing rapidly, total sensing time is crucial and must be minimised. Bayesian estimation and adaptive experiment optimisation can speed up the sensing process by reducing the number of measurements required. These protocols consist of computing and updating the probability distribution of the magnetic field based on measurement outcomes and of determining optimized acquisition settings for the next measurement. However, the computational steps feeding into the measurement settings of the next iteration must be performed quickly enough to allow real-time updates. This article addresses the issue of computational speed by implementing an approximate Bayesian estimation technique, where probability distributions are approximated by a finite sum of Gaussian functions. Given that only three parameters are required to fully describe a Gaussian density, we find that in many cases, the magnetic field probability distribution can be described by fewer than ten parameters, achieving a reduction in computation time by factor 10 compared to existing approaches. For, only a small decrease in computation time is achieved. However, in these regimes, the proposed Gaussian protocol outperforms the existing one in tracking accuracy.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Plant canopy structure affects the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) distribution, thereby strongly affecting plant growth. Therefore, it is important to understand the canopy structure and control it in some cases for plant production. Indices for evaluating the canopy structure include extinction coefficient, leaf area index (LAI) or leaf area density (LAD) distribution, and leaf angle distribution. LAI is an important index not only for plant growth but also for evaluating the light environment of the canopy. Several indirect but nondestructive ways for LAI estimation have been proposed, including methods using plant canopy analyzer (PCA), hemispherical photography, terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), spectral reflectance, and image analysis. Moreover, the canopy surface has a PPFD distribution because of its variation in leaf inclination and orientation. A simple method for evaluating PPFD distribution on plant canopy surface using the reflection image of canopy was proposed and successfully constructed PPFD histograms of the canopy surface of several plant species under both natural and artificial lights. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.","Canopy surface; Image analysis; LAI; Leaf angle; PPFD; Quantum sensor; Reflection image","Forestry; Plant life extension; Plants (botany); Surveying instruments; Extinction coefficients; Hemispherical photography; Leaf angle; Leaf angle distributions; Photosynthetic photon flux densities; PPFD; Quantum sensors; Terrestrial laser scanners; Image analysis","","","","","","","Anderson M.C., Studies of the woodland light climate 1.

One of the most interesting and challenging application of NV quantum sensors is nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging (nano-MRI), which would enable to address single biomolecules. To this goal, improving the sensitivity of the NV sensor is a crucial task. Here, we present a quantum optimal control method that optimizes the sensitivity of NV sensor to specific weak magnetic signals with biologically-relevant, complex spectrum. The method, based on the mapping of the sensing problem on a problem of energy optimization of an Ising chain, allows us to improve sensitivity by three orders of magnitude compared to standard control sequences. © 2022 IEEE.","magnetometry; nano-MRI; optimization problems; quantum control; quantum sensing","Diamonds; Magnetometers; Magnetometry; Nanomagnetics; Quantum theory; Biosensing; Nano scale; Nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging; Nitrogen vacancies; Optimal quantum control; Optimization problems; Quantum control; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Spin qubit; Magnetic resonance imaging","","","","","","","Bradac C., Gao W., Forneris J., Trusheim M.E., Aharonovich I., Quantum nanophotonics with group IV defects in diamond, Nat.

The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond is proposed and developed as an outstanding quantum sensor to realize NMR in nanoscale. In this work, a scheme for 2D nanoscale NMR spectroscopy is developed based on quantum controls on an NV center. A proof-of-principle experiment on a target of two coupled (Formula presented.) nuclear spins in diamond is carried out. A correlation spectroscopy (COSY) like sequence is used to acquire the data on time domain, which is then converted to frequency domain with the fast Fourier transform. With the 2D NMR spectrum, the structure and location of the set of nuclear spin are resolved. This work marks a fundamental step toward resolving the structure of a single molecule. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Light conditions at 16 understorey sites in a Panamanian lowland forest were continuously measured for 9 mo with quantum sensors and photodiodes. Light conditions at the sites were also assessed indirectly with hemispherical fisheye photographs, plant canopy analysis, 38-mm photographs, 24-mm photographs and a spherical densiometer. Estimates from all indirect methods, except the spherical densiometer, were highly correlated with the direct measurements. Short-term direct light measurements for a day or a week also correlated with long-term light conditions. The indirect measures differed by up to c. 70% from the direct measures relative to single site measurements. Hence, the indirect methods are inadequate where single site light conditions have to be assessed accurately. However, because light conditions encountered in the understorey varied up to 13-fold, the indirect methods were found to be well suited to rank understorey light conditions among a large number of sites. The results from frequent and infrequent sampling schedules differed only slightly, suggesting that taking indirect measures at the beginning and the end of a study offers a reasonable compromise between accuracy and sampling effort.","Fisheye photography; Hemispherical photography; Light measurement; Plant canopy analysis; PPFD; Spherical densiometer","estimation method; light; tropical forest; understory","","","","","","","Anderson M.C., Studies of woodland light climate.

Analyses were conducted to evaluate the aerodynamic and thermal effects on heat and mass transfer from vegetation canopies to greenhouse air, and the validity and comparability of resistance formulae for delineating the aerial effects. The differences of temperature and velocity between air within and above the canopy were found to be very significant. Thus it is necessary to distinguish aerodynamic and thermal parameters within these two distinct domains since the ""big-leaf and perfectly-stirred-tank"" assumption will be less satisfactory in estimating heat and water vapour fluxes from the greenhouse canopy. Three resistance terms were parameterized using the micrometeorological data, a stomatal resistance describing the physiological control, a boundary layer resistance controlling the exchange processes at leaf surfaces, and an aerodynamic resistance governing the vertical aerial transport processes. The parameterization of the resistances supported the hypothesis that, while the boundary layer resistance can be well formulated using similarity numbers, the aerodynamic resistance is largely dependent upon the aerodynamic and thermal conditions of the air column. It was shown that the similarity numbers should be determined using climatic parameters measured within the plant canopy, not above. Calibration of the aerodynamic resistance should be made with air temperatures measured at two vertical locations, not the difference between air and leaf temperatures. Further, such calibrated aerodynamic resistance is conceptually different and not comparable with the boundary layer resistance. © 1995 Silsoe Research Institute.","","","","","","","","","Udink Ten Cate A.J., Modeling and (Adaptive) control of greenhouse climate, Eur J Microbiol Immunol(Bp), (1983); Fernandez J.E., Bailey B.J., The influence of fans on environmental conditions in greenhouses, Journal of Agricultural Engineering Research, 58, pp. 201-210, (1994); Yang X., Short T.H., Fox R.D., Bauerle W.L., The microclimate and transpiration of a greenhouse cucumber crop, Transactions of the ASAE, 32, pp. 2143-2350, (1989); Monteith J.L., Unsworth M H Principles of Environmental Physics, (1990); Kaimal J.C., Finnigan J.J., Atmospheric Boundary Layer flows—their Structure and Measurement; Hinze J.O., Eur J Microbiol Immunol(Bp), (1975); Stanghellini C., Transpiration of greenhouse crops: An aid to climate management, Eur J Microbiol Immunol(Bp), (1987); Stanghellini C., Comment: Mixed convention above greenhouse crop canopies, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 66, pp. 111-117, (1983); Zhang L., Lemeur R Effect of aerodynamic resistance on energy balance and Penman-Monteith estimates of evapotranspiration in greenhouse conditions, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 58, pp. 209-228, (1992); Raupach M.R., Finnigan J.J., Single-layer models of evaporation from plant canopies are incorrect but useful, Australian Journal of Plant Phvsiol- Ogy, 15, pp. 705-716, (1988)","","","","","","","","","00218634","","","","English","J.

The biggest challenge in quantum sensing is decoherence due to the coupling between the sensor and the environment. The dissipation will destroy the quantum coherence and reduce the performance of the sensor. Here we show that quantum sensing can be realized under dissipation by engineering the steady state of the sensor. We demonstrate this protocol with a magnetometer based on ensemble nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, while neither high-quality initialization or readout of the sensor nor sophisticated dynamical decoupling sequences are required. Thus our method provides a concise and decoherence-resistant means of quantum sensing. The frequency resolution and precision of our magnetometer are far beyond the coherence time of the sensor. Furthermore, we show that the dissipation can be engineered to improve the performance of our sensor. By increasing the laser pumping, magnetic signals in a broad audio-frequency band from dc up to 140 kHz can be tackled by our method. Besides the potential applications in magnetic sensing and imaging on the microscopic scale, our results may provide opportunities for improvement of a variety of high-precision spectroscopies based on other quantum sensors.  © 2020 American Physical Society.

Relationships between the magnetic resonance signal magnitude and parameters of the optical system elements, which are based on the Stokes–Mueller formalism, are derived and verified. It is found that the main destructive influence in the signal in a standard two-beam scheme is produced by phase delays introduced by both metallic and dielectric mirrors. Methods for compensation of this destructive influence are proposed and verified. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","optically detected magnetic resonance; polarization of light; quantum magnetometer","","","","","","","","Budker D., Romalis M., Nat.

In this paper, we derive an electron displacement force based on a second-order expansion of the magnetic vector potential. The analysis illustrates the conservation of canonical angular momentum, where the mechanical angular momentum and field angular momentum sum to a constant of the motion; the azimuthal force required to change the mechanical momentum is thus supplied by changes in field momentum associated with the second-order vector potential term. Our results are consistent with all known Aharonov-Bohm experiments, including interference fringe shifts, lateral displacements, and the absence of longitudinal time delays.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Based on the recently developed self-aligned patterning techniques, ≈80 nitrogen vacancies are concentrated at a 100 nm2 area at the center of nanopillars to maximize the excitation and collection efficiencies. The spatial resolution of such a fiber-coupled diamond magnetometer can reach 100 nm for the first time with a sensitivity of 11.27 µT/ (Formula presented.) for DC magnetic field sensing. In addition, the probe can provide deterministic oriented diamond nanopillars for simplified vector magnetometry. This fiber-coupled diamond probe is applied to demonstrate the magnetic field imaging of charged electrodes in a confined box. These results mark a decisive step toward fiber-based applications with nanoscale vector magnetometry capabilities. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","fiber-coupled diamond quantum sensors; nanoscale magnetometry; nitrogen vacancy center","Diamonds; Magnetic fields; Magnetometers; Nitrogen; Optical fibers; Probes; Vectors; A.Fibres; Fiber coupled; Fiber-coupled diamond quantum sensor; Nano scale; NanoPillar; Nanoscale magnetometry; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Quantum sensors; Vector magnetometer; Vector magnetometry; Magnetometry","","","","","Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies, (AHY050000); Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0302200); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12104446, 12104447, 92265204, T2125011); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (GJJSTD20200001); University of Science and Technology of China, USTC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","Funding text 1: The fabrication was performed at the USTC Center for Micro and Nanoscale Research and Fabrication, and the authors particularly thank X.

This is due to their ability to switch between two well-defined states. Thus, the characterization of the state-switching process is essential for the application of these materials. For vanadium dioxide (VO 2), the phase transition can be determined from temperature, magnetic field, and dielectric constant. In this paper, we propose a diamond quantum sensing approach based on nitrogen-vacancy centers for analyzing phase transitions. By using lock-in-based optically detected magnetic resonance and Rabi measurement protocols, temperature and magnetic field can reflect local IMT information of the circuit, and microwave can determine IMT information of an electrical isolation region. Our multifunctional quantum sensor exhibits local, nondestructive, and integrated measurements, which are useful for reliability testing in IMT technology applications.  © 2023 Author(s).","","Magnetic resonance; Metal insulator transition; Nondestructive examination; Optical switches; Vanadium dioxide; Brain functions; Insulator metal transition; Lock-in; Magnetic-field; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Optical analogues; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Quantum sensors; State switching; Switching process; Magnetic fields","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12005218, 52130510, 62225506); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (YSBR-049); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (WK2030000062); Key Research and Development Program of Jiangxi Province, (BE2022066-2)","This work was supported by the Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology 2021ZD0303200, the CAS Project for Young Scientists in Basic Research (No. YSBR-049), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 62225506, 12005218, and 52130510), the Key Research and Development Plan of Jiangsu Province (No. BE2022066-2), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. WK2030000062).

We report the observation of inverted contrast between ODMR signals of the ES and the GS and clarify the effect of energy sublevels of spin states in 4H-SiC. We confirm that ES ODMR signals of V Si - centers are dependent on the temperature with a thermal shift of 2 MHz/K on zero-field splitting (ZFS). Thus, we fabricated microscale dots of V Si - centers in a 4H-SiC p-n diode using proton beam writing and demonstrated the operation of thermometric quantum sensors by measuring the temperature change induced by an injected current. Our demonstration paves the way for the development of atomic-size thermometers inside SiC power devices for future applications.  © 2021 Author(s).","","Excited states; Ground state; Magnetic resonance; Quantum theory; Silicon carbide; Future applications; Injected current; Negatively charged; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Proton beam writing; Silicon vacancies; Temperature changes; Zero-field splittings; Power semiconductor devices","","","","","GIST Research Institute; Global University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (17H01056, 18H03770, 20H00355, F11020); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Monbusho, (JPMXS0118067395); Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, GIST; Tokyo Institute of Technology, TITECH","The authors would like to thank Professor Y.

The latter is of great benefit when π pulses are displayed over biological samples as it reduces sample heating. Our method is general since it can be applied to different quantum sensor devices such as nitrogen vacancy centers or silicon vacancy centers. Furthermore, it can be directly incorporated in commonly used stroboscopic dynamical decoupling techniques to achieve enhanced nuclear selectivity and control, which demonstrates its flexibility. © 2019 American Physical Society.","","Biological samples; Dynamical decoupling; Electron-nuclear spin interactions; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Quantum sensors; Radiation power; Silicon vacancies; Spin interaction","","","","","Juan de la Cierva; MINECO/FEDER, (FIS2015-69983-P); Office of Advance Scientific Computing Research; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Advanced Scientific Computing Research, ASCR, (ERKJ335); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (820363, 820505)"," The authors thank J.

A Quantum Space Gravimetry (QSG) mission will provide corresponding Essential Climate Variables (ECV) with unprecedented quality compared to the initially demonstrated and already very successful missions like GOCE and GRACE (FO). To respond to the increasing demand of the user community for sustained mass change observations at higher spatial and temporal resolution, ESA and NASA are coordinating their activities and harmonizing their cooperation scenarios in an implementation framework, called MAGIC (MAss change and Geosciences International Constellation). In a future post-MAGIC mission, classical sensors can be combined with a Cold Atom Interferometry (CAT) instrument, or at a later stage a full quantum sensor could be employed. These Quantum Missions for Climate will reach sensitivities, which enable many applications addressing user needs with respect to water management and hazard prevention among others. Several studies related to these new sensor concepts were initiated at ESA, including technology development for different instrument configurations and validation activities. A new study has been initiated, the Quantum Space Gravimetry for Earth Mass Transport (QSG4EMT), with the focus on both, QSG mission architectures for monitoring of Earth's mass transport processes and the development of QSG user requirements. © 2023 SPIE.

The conventional temperature control module for VCSEL is based on a thermoelectric cooler (TEC) and temperature sensor. However, the package size is large, and the magnetic field noise is too large for real applications. In this study, we proposed a chip-scale packaging method with an overall dimension of 4 mm × 6 mm for VCSEL with a 795 nm output wavelength. With temperature uniformity and the magnetic field distribution profiles of the package, chips have been carefully evaluated. The generated magnetic field can decay to less than 100 nT within 3 mm. In all, we not only experimentally demonstrated an applicable thermal package structure, but also gave the magnitude and distance effects of the magnetic field caused by this structure. This study can provide an example and reference for the chip-scale temperature control packaging method of VCSELs and their application in quantum sensors. © 2023 The Authors","Finite element analysis; Heat transfer; Magnetic field analysis; Temperature controller; VCSEL","Chip scale packages; Heat transfer; Magnetic field effects; Surface emitting lasers; Temperature control; Thermal management (electronics); Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; Alkali atoms; Control module; Finite element analyse; Magnetic field analysiss; Magnetic-field; Packaging methods; Quantum sensors; Spectral line; Temperature controllers; Thermal field analysis; Finite element method","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (U20A2019); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (12204434, LQ21E060006)","This research was funded by the Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO.

To overcome the intrinsic electron spin lifetime limit in spectral resolution, a heterodyne detection approach is widely used. However, application of this technique at high magnetic fields is yet an unsolved problem. Here, we introduce a heterodyne detection method utilizing a series of phase coherent electron nuclear double resonance sensing blocks, thus eliminating the numerous Rabi microwave pulses required in the detection. Our detection protocol can be extended to high magnetic fields, allowing chemical shift resolution in NMR experiments. We demonstrate this principle on a weakly coupled 13C nuclear spin in the bath surrounding single NV centers, and compare the results to existing heterodyne protocols. Additionally, we identify the combination of NV-spin-initialization infidelity and strong sensor-target-coupling as linewidth-limiting decoherence source, paving the way towards high-field heterodyne NMR protocols with chemical resolution. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Chemical detection; Chemical shift; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Electrospinning; Heterodyne detection; Heterodyning; Magnetic fields; Nanomagnetics; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Spin dynamics; Detection approach; Electron spins; High magnetic fields; High resolution; Magnetic-field; Nano scale; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Resonance signals; Spin lifetimes; Unsolved problems; Magnetic moments","","","","","European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program ASTERIQS, (820394); European Research Council, ERC, (742610); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (FOR 2724); Volkswagen Foundation; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, MPG","We acknowledge financial support by European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program ASTERIQS under grant No. 820394, European Research Council advanced grant No. 742610, SMel, Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) project MiLiQuant and Quamapolis, the DFG (FOR 2724), the Max Planck Society, and the Volkswagentiftung.

Bi-planar gradient coils employed for diffusion weighting afford excellent spatial access, essential for integrating the NV-NMR components. Nevertheless, owing to the polar tilt of roughly 55 ∘ of the diamond NV center, the primary magnetic field direction must be taken into account accordingly. Methods: To determine the most effective bi-planar gradient coil configurations, we conducted an investigation into the impact of various factors, including the square side length, surface separation, and surface orientation. This was accomplished by generating over 500 bi-planar surface configurations using automated methods. Results: We successfully generated and evaluated coil layouts in terms of sensitivity and field accuracy. Interestingly, inclined bi-planar orientations close to the NV–NMR setup’s requirement, showed higher sensitivity for the transverse gradient channels than horizontal or vertical orientations. We fabricated a suitable solution as a three-channel bi-planar double-layered PCB system and experimentally validated the sensitivities at 28.7 m T/ m/ A and 26.8 m T/ m/ A for the transverse Gx and Gy gradients, and 26 m T/ m/ A for the Gz gradient. Discussion: We found that the chosen relative bi-planar tilt of 35 ∘ represents a reasonable compromise in terms of overall performance and allows for easier coil implementation with a straight, horizontal alignment within the overall experimental setup. © 2023, The Author(s).","Diamonds; Diffusion weighted imaging; Gradient coils; Magnetic resonance; MRI; NV centers; NV–NMR; Quantum Sensing","","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (948049); European Research Council, ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (326944748, 468440804); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (13GW0356B)","This work was supported by the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) with grant number 13GW0356B, furthermore by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) with Project number 468440804 and 326944748, as well and by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement number 948049).

The sensor uses a silicon photodiode along with a bandpass optical filter and a diffuser housed inside a 3D-printed enclosure. A prototype of the sensor was built and tested with a halogen light source. Its performance was compared with research-grade commercially-available PAR sensors and with a spectroradiometer. It was found that the error of the sensor depends on light intensity being the most accurate when the light source was set to maximum intensity. The cost of the developed sensor is lower than commercial solutions, making it attractive for agricultural applications where cost is an important factor. © 2020 IEEE","","3D printers; Agricultural robots; Diffusers (optical); Light sources; Design and Development; Halogen light sources; Maximum intensities; Photon flux densities; Photosynthetic active radiations; Photosynthetically active radiation; Silicon photodiode; Spectro-radiometers; Costs","","","","","","","Alados I., Foyo-Moreno I., Alados-Arboledas L., Photosynthetically active radiation: Measurements and modelling, Agricultural and Forest Metereology, 78, pp. 121-131, (1996); Ries G., Buchholz G., Frohnmeyer H., Hohn B., UV-damage-mediated induction of homologous recombination in Arabidopsis is dependent on photosynthetically active radiation, Proc.

Processing, storing, and communicating this ever-growing amount of data pose challenges for the current IT infrastructure. Edge computing—an emerging paradigm to overcome the shortcomings of cloud-based computing—could address these challenges. Furthermore, emerging technologies such as quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communications have the potential to fill the performance gaps left by their classical counterparts. Here, we present the concept of an edge quantum computing (EQC) simulator—a platform for designing the next generation of edge computing applications. An EQC simulator is envisioned to integrate elements from both quantum technologies and edge computing to allow studies of quantum edge applications. The presented concept is motivated by the increasing demand for more sensitive and precise sensors that can operate faster at lower power consumption, generating both larger and denser datasets. These demands may be fulfilled with edge quantum sensor networks. Envisioning the EQC era, we present our view on how such a scenario may be amenable to quantification and design. Given the cost and complexity of quantum systems, constructing physical prototypes to explore design and optimization spaces is not sustainable, necessitating EQC infrastructure and component simulators to aid in co-design. We discuss what such a simulator may entail and possible use cases that invoke quantum computing at the edge integrated with new sensor infrastructures. © 2022 by the authors.","edge computing; quantum communication; quantum internet; quantum network; quantum processors; quantum sensing; quantum sensors; sensors","Edge computing; Integrated circuit design; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Sensor networks; Edge computing; Edge sensing; Quantum Computing; Quantum internet; Quantum network; Quantum processors; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Spatial scale; Spatial temporals; Quantum communication","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL","This work was supported in part by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

The experiments were done on a laboratory quantum discriminator, the functional diagram of which contained a known element set for rubidium frequency standard on a gas cell. The discriminator was placed in the three identical pairs of Helmholtz coils, 50 cm in diameter, which created a working magnetic field (10 µT, 3 µT, and 1 µT) in the area of the gas cell. Helmholtz coils were connected to alternating voltage sources to create a rotating magnetic field relative to the normal to the direction of the pumping light. To weaken external magnetic noise and inhomogeneities of the laboratory magnetic field, the entire system was placed in a magnetic shield with a screening factor of 103, which practically made it possible to exclude the effect of the residual field on the measurements accuracy. The main experimental results are formulated as follows: the orientational frequency shift of the 0-0 radio-optical resonance does not depend on the magnitude of the working magnetic field and is linearly related to the pumping light intensity; when the working magnetic field is oriented normal to the quantum discriminator optical axis, the tensor and scalar components of the light shift have equal (positive) signs, which at any temperature of the filter-cell leads to their impossible compensation; when the working magnetic field is oriented along the quantum discriminator optical axis, the tensor and scalar components of the light shift have opposite signs, which at the corresponding temperature of the filter-cell leads to their possible (partial) compensation.  © 2020 IEEE.","Light shift frequency; Optical pumping; Quantum frequency standards","Cells; Cytology; Frequency standards; Magnetic shielding; Natural frequencies; Passive filters; Photonics; Pumps; Rubidium; Tensors; Alternating voltages; Frequency shift; Functional diagrams; Inhomogeneities; Optical resonance; Resonance frequencies; Rotating magnetic fields; Scalar component; Magnetic fields","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (20-19-00146)","This work was carried out in Peter the Great St.Petersburg Polytechnic University and was supported by a grant of Russian Science Foundation (project 20-19-00146).","Riehle F., Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications, (2006); Happer W., Effective operator formalism in optical pumping, Physical Review, 163, 1, pp. 12-25, (1967); Mathur B.S., Tang H., Happer W., Light shifts in alkali atoms, Physical Review, 171, pp. 11-19, (1968); Semenov V.V., On the contribution of the tensor component to the light shift of the frequency of radio-optical microwave resonance in rubidium vapor, Izvestiya VUZov.

A low-cost, miniaturized and innovative device, named PARADe (PAR Acquisition Device), is designed for in-field photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) acquisition. It combines an affordable PAR line quantum sensor (PAR/LE, SOLEMS) and an open source development platform (microcontroller) based on Arduino Integrated Development Environment. The quality of the measurement of the PARADe acquisition chain has been validated. The calibration is done by comparison (R2=0.99) with a robust acquisition chain composed of a certified PAR sensor (PQS1, Kipp and Zonen) and a data-logger (CR1000 Campbell Scientific). The accuracy of PARADe measurements is evaluated through three indicators, relative error, RMSE and normalized RMSE. They demonstrate that the PARADe system has certain operating limitations especially for low solar angles (sunset and sunrise) due to the choice of a line quantum sensor. This does not affect the accuracy and reliability of the results, but indicates that the PARADe device is specifically adapted to collect daily cumulative PAR values. © 2021","Calibration; Data logging; ESP32 card; Open source; PAR sensor; Wi-Fi","","","","","","","","Pashiardis S., Kalogirou S.A., Pelengaris A., Characteristics of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) through statistical analysis at Larnaca, Cyprus, Biomed.

Previously, we have theoretically and experimentally investigated the effect of finite pulse width on quantum sensing for synchronous alternating-current (AC) magnetic fields to dynamical decoupling sequences [T. Ishikawa et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 10, 054059 (2018)]. However, many biological and condensed-matter systems exhibit fluctuating AC fields over time, and thus, our model needs modifications because of additional non-ideal conditions in practical measurements. Here, we investigate the effects of finite pulse width of multiple-pulse decoupling sequences on quantum sensing for asynchronous AC magnetic fields. For this purpose, we use a spin ensemble of nitrogen vacancy centers in an isotopically purified diamond film. We reveal through experiments that the finite-width pulse causes shifts in AC magnetometry signals in a free-precession-time plot. In addition, our results indicate that the finite-width pulse affects the amplitude of magnetometry signals, implying that the finite-pulse-width effect should be taken into account for realizing accurate measurement of the frequency and amplitude of asynchronous AC magnetic fields. © 2019 Author(s).","","Diamond films; Electric impedance measurement; Electrospinning; Magnetic fields; Magnetic moments; Magnetometers; Nitrogen; Quantum theory; Spin dynamics; Accurate measurement; Alternating current; Condensed matter system; Dynamical decoupling; Electron spin state; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Non-ideal conditions; Pulse width effect; Magnetometry","","","","","Correlated Electronics Group; Hitoshi Sumiya; SEN-TAN; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, AIST; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP15H05853); Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (JP17K14079); Development of Advanced Measurement and Analysis Systems, SENTAN","Funding text 1: We acknowledge Hitoshi Sumiya (Sumitomo Electric Industries) for supplying the diamond substrate and Yoshikiyo Toyosaki (Correlated Electronics Group, AIST) for technical support with photolithography.

This study presents a comprehensive review of quantum sensing state-of-practice. It also provides a detailed analysis of how quantum sensing overcomes the existing limitations of sensor-driven systems' precision and performance. Based on the review of over 500 quantum sensor prototype reports, we determined four groups of quantum sensors and discussed their readiness for commercial usage. We concluded that quantum magnetometry and quantum optics are the most advanced sensing technologies with empirically proven results. In turn, quantum timing and kinetics are still in the early stages of practical validation. In addition, we defined four systems domains in which quantum sensors offer a solution for existing limitations of conventional sensing technologies. These domains are 1) GPS-free positioning and navigating services, 2) time-based operations, 3) topological visibility, and 4) environment detection, prediction, and modeling. Finally, we discussed the current constraints of quantum sensing technologies and offered directions for future research. © 2013 IEEE.","quantum computing; quantum information science; Quantum sensing technology; quantum sensors; quantum systems","Magnetometers; Magnetometry; Quantum optics; Superconducting magnets; Current rise; Extraterrestrial measurements; Quantum information science; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensing technology; Quantum sensors; Quantum system; Sensing technology; Sensitivity; System applications; Temperature measurement","","","","","","","Alfieri A., Anantharaman S.B., Zhang H., Jariwala D., Nanomaterials for quantum information science and engineering, Adv.

This paper will first review some of the proposed ideas and engineering designs behind both entanglement radar and coherent state radar design schemes. Entanglement radar is based on first entangling two photons, then sending one of the entangled photons out towards the target, and keeping the other one at home. A correlation between the two photons is analyzed to obtain information. Coherent state quantum radar relies on using coherent state photons and a quantum detection scheme in order to beat the diffraction limit. Based on the above, a proposed design concept to implement of a coherent state quantum radar is presented for simultaneously determining target range and azimuth/elevation angles. © 2014 SPIE.","Coherent States; Entanglement; Quantum Radar","Design; Diffraction; Photons; Radar; Radar equipment; Coherent state; Design considerations; Diffraction limits; Engineering design; Entangled photons; Entanglement; Quantum detection; Quantum phenomena; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Shapiro J.H., Lloyd S., Quantum illumination versus coherent-state target detection, New Journal of Physics, 11, (2009); Lanzagorta M., Quantum R., Morgan & Claypool, (2012); Jiang K., Lee H., Gerry C.C., Dowling J.P., Super-resolving quantum radar: Coherent-state sources with homodyne detection suffice to beat the diffraction limit, Journal of Applied Physics, 114, (2013); Lanzagorta M., Amplification of radar and lidar signatures using quantum sensors, Proceedings of the SPIE Conference Active and Passive Signatures IV, (2013); Glauber R.J., Coherent and incoherent states of the radiation field, Physical Review, 131, pp. 2766-2788, (1963); Bassyouni A., A new radar system based on entangled photonic beam, Proceedings of the IASTED International Conference on Antennas, Radar and Wave Propagation (ARP 2010)], pp. 109-115, (2010); Narayanan R.M., Mueller R.D., Palmer R.D., Random noise radar interferometry, Proceedings of the SPIE Conference on Radar Processing, Technology, and Applications, pp. 75-82, (1996); Emary C., Trauzettel B., Beenakker C.W.J., Emission of polarization-entangled microwave photons from a pair of quantum dots, Physical Review Letters, 95, (2005)","","","SPIE","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Radar Sensor Technology XVIII","5 May 2014 through 7 May 2014","Baltimore, MD","106801","0277786X","978-162841014-3","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84905693905"

The effect of increasing the rms amplitude of the projection noise in a magnetometric scheme under the influence of a strong optical pumping has been demonstrated. Its explanation has been proposed and experimentally confirmed: it has been shown that this effect is explained by the invariance of the integral power of projection noise in relation to the magnetic resonance linewidth in a wide range of pumping intensities An experimental study of the parameters of projection noise in a magnetometric quantum sensor has been conducted and recommendations for optimizing the sensor parameters have been given. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","","","","","","","Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ, (19-29-10004, 19-52-12054)","The theoretical part of the research (section Theory) was funded by Russian Foundation for Basic Research, project number 19-52-12054.

Measuring albedo of the UVA and the Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR) wavelength range involves measuring the global irradiance and the reflections from the slopes around the measuring location. This system can be installed in any mountain peak to measure the reflectivity around the snow covered slopes. Global irradiance is measured by a standard global sensor using a Gigahertz UVA head and a home built UVA head. The UVA reflection is measured by an 1°telescope fitted with a home built UVA head. The home built UVA detector systems have been built using Hamamatsu silicon UV diodes and temperature stabilized using Peltier elements driven by a closed loop feedback control system. Two such similar systems have been built and used for directional and global measurements for direct comparison. PAR reflection is measured by a standard area CCD camera fitted with a wide angle lens and an optical filter. Global PAR is measured by using LI-COR Quantum sensors. The telescope and the CCD camera have been mounted on an Alta-Azimuth mount for scanning the surface around the peak to measure the reflectivity. A set of reflection standards along with the global PAR sensor has been mounted on a boom and fixed with the azimuth table. These reflection standards are visible in the field of view of the CCD camera. This provides the reference pixels in every CCD image that can be used to calibrate the rest of the CCD pixels. This system has been used to make the albedo images at the Zugspitze for the CUVRA (Characteristic of Ultra Violet Radiation in the Alps) project. Preliminary results are shown here.","","snow; Austria; conference paper; control system; diode; environmental radioactivity; feedback system; instrument; radiation measurement; sensor; ultraviolet A radiation","","","","","","","Kylling A., Persen T., Mayer B., Svenoe T., Determination of an effective spectral Albedo from ground based global and direct UV irradiance measurements, J.

For sensing, the crux is to minimise the measurement uncertainty in a chosen range within a given time. However, basic quantum sensing protocols cannot simultaneously achieve both a high sensitivity and a large range. Here, we demonstrate a non-adaptive algorithm for increasing this range, in principle without limit, for alternating-current field sensing, while being able to get arbitrarily close to the best possible sensitivity. Therefore, it outperforms the standard measurement concept in both sensitivity and range. Also, we explore this algorithm thoroughly by simulation, and discuss the T−2 scaling that this algorithm approaches in the coherent regime, as opposed to the T−1/2 of the standard measurement. The same algorithm can be applied to any modulo-limited sensor. © 2021, The Author(s).","","algorithm; quantum mechanics; sensor; spatial resolution; uncertainty analysis; algorithm; alternating current; Article; controlled study; quantum mechanics","","","","","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Monbusho, (15H05868, 16H06326, JPMXS0118067395); Kyoto University, (2019-103); Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University, ICR","The authors acknowledge the financial support from MEXT Q-LEAP (No. JPMXS0118067395), KAKENHI (No. 15H05868, 16H06326) and the Collaborative Research Program of ICR, Kyoto University (2019-103).

Geometric reasoning demonstrates the conditions, necessary and sufficient, for saturating the fundamental and attainable quantum-process bound in this context. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd","Cramer-Rao bound; Fisher information; Multi-parameter estimation; Process norm; Quantum metrology","","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Canada First Research Excellence Fund, CFREF","Both authors thank the University of New Mexico’s Center for Quantum Information and Control for providing a stimulating intellectual environment.

Continuously excited (CE) Ramsey magnetometry is one of the most sensitive measurement protocols and has the potential to improve the sensitivity of sensors using additional quantum manipulations to extend the spin dephasing time. In a typical ensemble NV measurement, the spin dephasing time is limited by inhomogeneous coupling. To overcome this limitation, a magnetometry that extends the CE Ramsey protocol with a double-quantum (DQ) Ramsey sequence and spin bath driving is developed. It is demonstrated that the electric noise due to the spatial inhomogeneity of the crystal strain is cancelled out by the DQ Ramsey, and the magnetic noise due to the P1 centers was suppressed by spin bath driving. Compared to the conventional CE Ramsey, the CE-DQ Ramsey with spin bath driving effectively doubles the gyromagnetic ratio and yields a twofold extension of (Formula presented.), corresponding to a fourfold enhancement of the photon-shot-noise limited sensitivity. © 2023 The Authors. physica status solidi (a) applications and materials science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.","diamond quantum sensors; nitrogen vacancy center; Ramsey magnetometry; spin bath driving; spin dephasing time","Magnetometers; Medical applications; Nitrogen; Shot noise; Dephasing time; Diamond quantum sensor; Double-quantum; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Quantum sensors; Ramsey magnetometry; Spin bath; Spin bath driving; Spin dephasing; Spin dephasing time; Magnetometry","","","","","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (JPMXS 0118067395); Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (JPMJSP2106)","This work was supported by the MEXT Quantum Leap Flagship Program (Q‐LEAP) under grant number JPMXS 0118067395 and JST SPRING under grant number JPMJSP2106.

Compared with optical fiber-based components, semiconductor waveguides achieve very compact guiding of optical signals for both passive functions, such as splitting and recombining, and for active functions, such as switching or modulation. Quantum sensors, which have enhanced sensitivity to a physical parameter as a result of their quantum nature, can be made from quantum gases of ultra-cold atoms. A cloud of ultra-cold atoms may start to exhibit quantum-mechanical properties when it is trapped and cooled using laser cooling in a magneto-optical trap, to reach milli-Kelvin temperatures. The work presented here focuses on the design and fabrication of optical devices for a quantum sensor to measure the acceleration of gravity precisely and accurately. In this case the cloud of ultra-cold atoms consists of rubidium (87Rb) atoms and the sensor exploits the hyperfine structure of the D1 transition, from an outer electronic state of 5 2S12 to 5 2P3/2 which has an energy of 1.589 eV or 780.241 nm. The short wavelength of operation of the devices dictated stringent requirements on the Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) and device fabrication in terms of anisotropy and smoothness of plasma etch processes, cross-wafer uniformities and alignment tolerances. Initial measurements of the optical loss of the polarization-maintaining waveguide, assuming Fresnel reflection losses only at the facets, suggested a loss of 8 dB cm-1, a loss coefficient, α, of 1.9 (±0.3) cm-1. © 2014 SPIE.","Algaas; Cold atoms; gravimeter; Photonic circuit; Polarization; Rubidium; Semiconductor; Waveguide","Gravimeters; Integrated optics; Mechanical properties; Molecular beam epitaxy; Optical fiber fabrication; Optical fibers; Optical waveguides; Polarization; Rubidium; Semiconductor materials; Sensors; Switching functions; Waveguides; Algaas; Cold atoms; Fiber-based components; Millikelvin temperatures; Photonic circuits; Photonic integrated circuits; Polarization-maintaining waveguides; Semiconductor waveguide; Atoms","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (250072)","","De Angelis M., Angonin M.C., Beaufils Q., Becker Ch., Bertoldi A., Bongs K., Boudel T., Bouyer P., Boyer V., Dorscher S., Duncker H., Ertmer W., Fernholz T., Fromhold T.M., Herr W., Kruger P., Kurbis Ch., Mellor C.J., Pereira Dos Santos F., Peters A., Poli N., Popp M., Prvedelli M., Rasel E.M., Rudolph J., Schreck F., Sengstock K., Sorrentino F., Stellmer S., Tino G.M., Valenzuela T., Wendrich T.J., Wicht A., Windpassinger P., Wolf P., ISense: A portable ultracold-atom-based gravimeter, Procedia Computer Science, 7, pp. 334-336, (2011); Charriere R., Cadoret M., Zahzam N., Bidel Y., Bresson A., Local gravity measurement with the combination of atom interferometry and Bloch oscillations, Physical Review A, 85, (2012); Wasilewski Z.R., Dion M.M., Lockwood D.J., Poole P., Streater R.W., Springthorpe A.J., Composition of AlGaAs, Journal of Applied Physics, 81, (1997); Foxon C.T., Clegg J.B., Woodbridge K., Hilton D., Dawson P., Blood P., The effect of the oxygen concentration on the electrical and optical properties of AlGaAs films grown by MBE, Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology, B, 3, (1985); Balmer R.S., Martin T., Kane M.J., Maclean J.O., Whitaker T.J., Ayling S.G., Calcott P.D.J., Houlton M., Newey J.P., O'Mahony S.J., Integrated laser/waveguide by shadow-masked selective area epitaxy using chemical beam epitaxy (CBE), Journal of Crystal Growth, 209, pp. 486-491, (2000); Heaton J.M., Bourke M.M., Jones S.B., Smith B.H., Hilton K.P., Smith G.W., Birbeck J.C.H., Berry G., Dewar S.V., Wight D.R., Optimization of deep-etched, single-mode GaAs / AlGaAs optical waveguides using controlled leakage into the substrate, Journal of Light Wave Technology, 17, 2, pp. 267-281, (1999); Adachi S., GaAs, AlAs and AlxGa1-xAs: Material parameters for use in research and device applications, Journal of Applied Physics, 58, RT, pp. 1-29, (1985); Rahman B.M.A., Obayya S.S.A., Boonthittanont W., Heaton J.M., Novel polarization- maintaining semiconductor waveguide, IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, 16, pp. 807-809, (2004); Wieman C.E., Hollberg L., Using diode lasers for atomic physics, Review of Scientific Instruments, 62, 1, pp. 1-20, (1991); Tittelbach G., Richter B., Karthe W., Comparison of three transmission methods for integrated optical waveguide propagation loss measurement, Pure and Applied Optics, 2, pp. 683-706, (1993); Gleyzes S., El Amili A., Cornelussen R.A., Lalanne P., Westbrook C.I., Aspect A., Estve J., Moreau G., Martinez A., Lafosse X., Ferlazzo L., Harmand J.C., Mailly D., Ramdane A., Towards a monolithic optical cavity for atom detection and manipulation, European Physical Journal D, 53, 1, pp. 107-111, (2009); Hibbs-Brenner M.K., Sullivan C.T., Low-loss AlGaAs optical rectangular waveguides at 830 nm, Applied Physics Letters, 56, 16, pp. 1529-1531, (1990)","","","SPIE","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Integrated Optics: Devices, Materials, and Technologies XVIII","3 February 2014 through 5 February 2014","San Francisco, CA","105331","0277786X","978-081949901-1","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901751437"

However, the spin level structure of the VB- color center is still unclear, especially for the excited state. Here we measured and confirmed the excited-state spin transitions of VB- using an optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) technique. The zero-field splitting of the excited state is 2.06 GHz, the transverse splitting is 93.1 MHz, and the g factor is 2.04. Moreover, negative peaks in fluorescence intensity and ODMR contrast at the level anticrossing point were observed, and they further confirmed that the spin transitions we measured came from the excited state. Our work deepens the understanding of the excited-state structure of VB- and promotes VB-based quantum sensing applications. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","color center; excited state; hexagonal boron nitride; optically detected magnetic resonance","Boron nitride; Color; III-V semiconductors; Magnetic resonance; Nitrides; Quantum theory; Colour centers; Excited state spectroscopy; Excited-states; Hexagonal boron nitride; Negatively charged; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Property; Quantum sensors; Spin levels; Spin transition; article; fluorescence intensity; nuclear magnetic resonance; spectroscopy; Excited states","","","","","Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies, (AHY050000); USTC Research Funds of the Double First-Class Initiative, (YD2340002004); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11775209, 11804329, 12104447, 81788101, T2125011); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (GJJSTD20200001, QYZDYSSW-SLH004, XDC07000000); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2020M671858); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFA0305000, 2018YFA0306600); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","The fabrication was performed at the USTC Center for Micro and Nanoscale Research and Fabrication, and the authors particularly thank X.

In particular, those based on colour centres in diamond have demonstrated high sensitivity to magnetic field through exploiting the field-dependent emission of fluorescence under coherent control using microwaves. Given the highly biocompatible nature of diamond, sensing from biological samples is a key interdisciplinary application. In particular, the microscopic-scale study of living systems can be possible through recording of temperature and biomagnetic field. In this work, we use such a quantum sensor to demonstrate such microscopic-scale recording of electrical activity from neurons in fragile living brain tissue. By recording weak magnetic field induced by ionic currents in mouse corpus callosum axons, we accurately recover signals from neuronal action potential propagation while demonstrating in situ pharmacology. Our sensor allows recording of the electrical activity in neural circuits, disruption of which can shed light on the mechanisms of disease emergence. Unlike existing techniques for recording activity, which can require potentially damaging direct interaction, our sensing is entirely passive and remote from the sample. Our results open a promising new avenue for the microscopic recording of neuronal signals, offering the eventual prospect of microscopic imaging of electrical activity in the living mammalian brain. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Animals; Brain; Diamond; Fluorescence; Magnetic Fields; Mammals; Mice; Neurons; diamond; animal; brain; fluorescence; magnetic field; mammal; mouse; nerve cell; physiology","","diamond, 7782-40-3; Diamond, ","","","European Research Council, ERC, (SyG 856432); Danmarks Grundforskningsfond, DNRF, (DNRF142); Lundbeck Foundation, (R186); Det Sundhedsvidenskabelige Fakultet, Københavns Universitet, SUND, KU; Novo Nordisk Fonden, NNF, (NNF17OC0028086, NNF21OC0066526); Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond, DFF, (0135-00142B, NNF20OC0061673)","This work was funded by the Novo Nordisk foundation through the synergy grant bioQ (Grant Number: NNF17OC0028086), the NNF Challenge Grant BIO-MAG (NNF21OC0066526) and the Center for Macroscale Quantum States (bigQ) funded by the Danish National Research Foundation (Grant number:DNRF142).

The same interaction with the environment, however, limits the device sensitivity by reducing the coherence of the quantum states. Quantum control can play a crucial role in improving the sensor performance. We explore quantum control tools to improve the performance of a NitrogenVacancy (NV) center as a single-qubit sensor of ultra-weak magnetic fields in noisy environments. We present a method to obtain a precise spectroscopic characterization of the NV environment, instrumental to design robust sensing strategies with improved noise protection. Then, we exploit optimal quantum control based on a set of numerical methods to optimize the temporal dependence of the sensor driving field adapted to quantum sensing purposes, and prove its advantage to achieve best compromises between signal acquisition and noise cancellation. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

We investigate the electronic properties of oxidized diamond (111) surfaces and their effects on the NV− centers using the density of functional theory. The results show that the epoxy oxidized diamond (111) surface has neither surface spin noises nor inter-bandgap states and also has a positive electron affinity (1.85 eV) with nearly 99% preferential alignment of nitrogen-vacancy, indicating the epoxy oxidized (111) surface could be a perfect host of the NV− centers. Additionally, we make further examinations by placing an NV− center ∼1 nm from the epoxy oxidized (111) surface. The results indicate that the epoxy oxidized (111) surface has no obvious effects on the defect levels and optical transitions of the single NV− center. To the best our knowledge, the epoxy oxidized (111)-(2 × 1) surface may be the first diamond surface that not only theoretically satisfies the electronic requirements of shallow NV− centers but can also be fabricated through the oxidization process.

Current quantum platforms in experimental atomic and optical physics based on CMOS sensors and charged coupled device cameras are limited by either low sensitivity or slow operational speed. Here an array of single-photon avalanche diodes is integrated with solid-state spin defects in diamond to build a fast wide-field quantum sensor, achieving a frame rate up to 100 kHz. The design of the experimental setup to perform spatially resolved imaging of quantum systems is presented. A few exemplary applications, including sensing DC and AC magnetic fields, temperature, strain, local spin density, and charge dynamics, are experimentally demonstrated using a nitrogen-vacancy ensemble diamond sample. The developed photon detection array is broadly applicable to other platforms such as atom arrays trapped in optical tweezers, optical lattices, donors in silicon, and rare earth ions in solids. © 2023 The Authors.

We design schemes that allow one to achieve optimal scaling and are immune to noise sources with a different spatial dependence than the signal. This is achieved by using a sensor array of spatially separated sensors and constructing a multi-dimensional decoherence free subspace. While in the Fisher regime with sharp prior and multiple measurements only the spectral range Δ is important, in single-shot sensing with broad prior the number of available energy levels L is crucial. We study the influence of L and Δ also in intermediate scenarios, and show that these quantities can be optimized separately in our setting. This provides us with a flexible scheme that can be adapted to different situations, and is by construction insensitive to given noise sources.  © 2020 The Author(s).

It is known that most of PAR from solar radiation is well absorbed by the surface. The canopy is the surface in forest region, consists an aboveground portion of plant community and formed by plant crowns. On the other hand, incident solar radiation is fluctuating at all times because of fluctuating sky conditions. Therefore, qualitative light environmental measurements in forest are recommended to execute under stable cloudy condition. In fact, it is quite a few opportunities to do under this sky condition. It means that the diffuse light condition without the direct light is only suitable for this measurement. In this study, we challenged the characterization the forest light environment as its representativeness under no consideration of sky conditions through analysis huge quantities of instantaneous data which obtained under the different sky conditions. All examined data were obtained under the different sky conditions at the tropical rainforest canopy as one of the typical fluctuating sky conditions regions. An incident PAR is transmitted and scattered by different forest layers at different heights. Various PAR data were measured with quantum units as Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD) at different forest heights by the quantum sensors. By comparing PPFDs at different heights with an incident PPFD, relative PPFDs were calculated, which indicate the degree of PPFD decrease from the canopy top to lower levels. As the results of these considerations, daily averaging is confirmed to be cancelled sky fluctuating influences.","Characterization; Fluctuating; Light environment; PAR; Representativeness; Sky condition","Radiation; Remote Sensing; Sun Light; Characterization; Forestry; Light sources; Plants (botany); Solar radiation; Sun; Fluctuating; Light environment; PAR; Representativeness; Sky condition; Incident solar radiation","","","","","","","Kenzo T., Ichie T., Watanabe Y., Yoneda R., Ninomiya I., Koike T., Change in photosynthesis and leaf characteristics with tree height in five dipterocarpaceae species in a tropical rain forest, Tree Physiology, 26, pp. 865-873, (2006); Lowman D.M., Nadkarni M.N., Forest Canopies, (1995); Nakashizuka T., Sakai S., Chong L., Lambir Hills National Park canopy crane, Malaysia, Studying Forest Canopies from Above: The International Canopy Crane Network, pp. 120-125, (2003); Yamashita M., Yoshimura M., The Diurnal Global and Diffuse PAR Change Analysis by Sky Conditions and its Characteristics, Journal of Environmental Information Science, 37, 5, pp. 7-14, (2009); Yoshimura M., Yamashita M., Measurement of tropical rainforest three-dimensional light environment and its diurnal change, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 33, 3, pp. 848-859, (2012)","","Altan O.; Taberner M.; Sunar F.","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","ISPRS Technical Commission VII Mid-Term Symposium 2014","29 September 2014 through 2 October 2014","Istanbul","111196","16821750","","","","English","Int.

For high-sensitivity quantum sensors with NV center ensembles, uniform manipulation of the electron spins of the NV centers in large volumes is required. In addition, a broad microwave frequency bandwidth for manipulating the NV centers' electron spin is necessary for vector magnetometry and measurement under a finite static magnetic field. Here, we demonstrate a broadband microwave antenna for uniform manipulation of millimeter-scale volumes of diamond quantum sensors. The simulation shows that the current is distributed at both edges of the loop coil of a single copper plate due to the skin effect. The loop coil acts like a Helmholtz coil, which realizes uniformity in the z-direction of the microwave magnetic field (B1). The plate structure has a higher mechanical stability, durability, and a larger heat capacity than the Helmholtz coil, due to its large volume. The antenna achieves a higher performance than previously reported antennae, with a maximal B1 of 4.5 G, a broad bandwidth of 287 ± 6 MHz, and a peak-to-peak variation of 9.2 % over a 3.1 mm3 cylinder volume. These performances show that the presented antenna is suitable for manipulating solid-state spin ensembles for high-sensitivity quantum sensors. © 2022 Author(s).","","Bandwidth; Diamonds; Electrospinning; Magnetic fields; Microwave antennas; Microwave sensors; Plates (structural components); Quantum theory; Spin dynamics; Electron spins; Frequency band width; Helmholtz coil; High sensitivity; Large volumes; Microwaves frequency; Millimeter-scale; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Performance; Quantum sensors; Magnetic moments","","","","","Spintronics Research Network of Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (20H00354, 21H04653); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (JPMXS0118067395, JPMXS0118068379)","This work was supported by the Program on Open Innovation Platform with Enterprises, Research Institute and Academia (OPERA) (No. JPMJOP1841) and partially supported by MEXT Quantum Leap Flagship Program (MEXT Q-LEAP) (Grant Nos.

Here, we present a wide-field, quantitative imaging of the stray field of the vortices in a superconducting thin film using perfectly aligned diamond quantum sensors. Our analysis, which mitigates the influence of the sensor inhomogeneities, visualizes the magnetic flux of single vortices in YBa2Cu3O7−δ with an accuracy of ±10%. The obtained vortex shape is consistent with the theoretical model, and penetration depth and its temperature dependence agree with previous studies, proving our technique's accuracy and broad applicability.

The reason is that it would be electrically neutral and have less Pauli-Principle repulsion. Binding would increase with numbers of quarks, and might not begin below thousands. It would have nuclear density. Neutron stars would be strange quark stars; and it might conceivably constitute dark matter. One way to detect ton-range SQM nuggets (SQNs) would be from seismic signals they would make passing through the Earth. We give a rough estimate on the relative advantage of attempting to detect SQNs on the Moon over Earth (about 50 times more detections). © 2005 COSPAR.","Moon; Seismic detection; Strange quark matter","Astrophysics; Electron energy levels; Moon; Neutrons; Seismology; Neutron stars; Seismic detection; Seismic signals; Strange quark matter; Space research","","","","","","","Anderson D.P., Herrin E.T., Teplitz V.L., Tibuleac I.M., Unexplained sets of seismographic station reports and a set consistent with a quark nugget passage, Bull.

However, nanoscale electric-field mapping has not been achieved so far because of the relatively weak coupling strength between NV and electric field. Here, using individual shallow NVs, we quantitatively image electric field contours from a sharp tip of a qPlus-based atomic force microscope (AFM), and achieve a spatial resolution of ~10 nm. Through such local electric fields, we demonstrated electric control of NV’s charge state with sub-5 nm precision. This work represents the first step towards nanoscale scanning electrometry based on a single quantum sensor and may open up the possibility of quantitatively mapping local charge, electric polarization, and dielectric response in a broad spectrum of functional materials at nanoscale. © 2021, The Author(s).","","nitrogen; diamond; dielectric property; electric field; magnetic field; polarization; spatial resolution; Article; atomic force microscopy; controlled study; electric field; ionization; nonhuman; oscillation; polarization; static electricity","","nitrogen, 7727-37-9","","","RGC, (GRF/14304419, GRF/14304618, GRF/ECS/24304617); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (820445); VWR Foundation; Xi'an Eurasia University, EU; European Research Council, ERC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11634001, 11888101, 21725302); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDB28000000); Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, BMSTC, (Z181100004218006); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFA0300901, 2017YFA0205003)","The authors thank Xinyu Pan and Gangqin Liu for the generous help on NV instrumentations, Zhihai Cheng for valuable suggestions on AFM technologies, Nan Zhao and Marcus Doherty for insightful discussions on the data interpretation, and Bowen Song for valuable assistance on graphics and data processing.

A cryogenic variable temperature blackbody load has been developed to test the optical efficiencies of ultra-low-noise (NEP 10-19 WHz-1/2) Transition Edge Sensors for space science. The few-mode, partially coherent illumination conditions of the measurement system are engineered to be precisely the same as those of the telescope. We have used a SPICA/SAFARI-like telescope/detector for demonstration purposes. The essential difference between the test system and an equivalent representation of the telescope's optics is that the telescope has a lens of effective focal length f, but the test system does not. A key part of our analysis is to describe behaviour in terms of the optical modes of the test system, as distinct from the optical modes of the detector under test. In the paper we describe the analysis of the test assembly in terms of signal power, background power and photon noise.","","Nanosensors; Background power; Effective focal lengths; Measurement system; Optical efficiency; Optical modelling; Partially coherent illumination; Transition-edge sensors; Variable temperature; Telescopes","","","","","","","Ade P.D., Mauskopf P.A.R., Beyer J., Bruijn M., Gao J.R., Glowacka D., Goldie D., Giffin D., Griffin N.J., Howvers H.F.C., Khosrapanah P., Kooijma P., De Korte P.A.J., Morozov D., Murphy A., O'Sullivan C., Ridder M., Trappe N., Van Weers H., Van Der Kuur J., Withington S., A tes focal plane for spica-safari, ISSTT, pp. 246-255, (2010); Marquardt E.D., Le J.P., Radebaugh R., Cryogenic Material Properties Database, (2000); Ventura G., Barucci M., Gottardi E., Peroni I., Low temperature thermal conductivity of kevlar, Cryogenics, 40, pp. 489-491, (2000); Withington S., Goldie D.J., Thomas C.N., Partially Coherent Optical Modelling of the Ultra-Low-Noise Far-Infrared Imaging Arrays on the SPICA Mission, (2013); Saklatvala G., Withington S., Hobson M.P., Coupled-mode theory for infrared and submillimeter wave detectors, J.

Many photoelectric sensors or 1-m-long line sensors that integrate individual interception points for spatial averaging were replaced with fiberoptics, which integrate interception points. Depending on the positioning of optical fibers and the amount of fibers terminated at a PAR sensor, whole-plant, canopy layer, and individual leaf light interception can be determined. The use of fiberoptics has the added advantage of being very small in comparison to the bulk of a typical quantum sensor. The fiberoptic-based system potentially is a more accurate, less expensive method to integrate PAR throughout plant canopies than PAR sensors.","Acer rubrum; Leaf area index; Light interception","Acer; Acer rubrum; Rickettsia sp.

While scanning NV magnetometry is well-established, NV electrometry has been so far limited to bulk diamonds. Here we demonstrate imaging external alternating (AC) and direct (DC) electric fields with a single NV at the apex of a diamond scanning tip under ambient conditions. A strong electric field screening effect is observed at low frequencies. We quantitatively measure its frequency dependence and overcome this screening by mechanically oscillating the tip for imaging DC fields. Our scanning NV electrometry achieved an AC E-field sensitivity of 26 mV μm−1 Hz−1/2, a DC E-field gradient sensitivity of 2 V μm−2 Hz−1/2, and sub-100 nm resolution limited by the NV-sample distance. Our work represents an important step toward building a scanning-probe-based multimodal quantum sensing platform. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Diamonds; Electric fields; Electric impedance measurement; Electrometers; Ambient conditions; Ambients; E-field; Electric field screening; Field imaging; Nano scale; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Quantum sensors; Strong electric fields; Scanning","","","","","National Quantum Information Science Research Center; Quantum Science Center; Yonatan Cohen and Niv Drucker; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE","Funding text 1: We thank Yonatan Cohen and Niv Drucker for their support on the Quantum Orchestration Platform, Shaowen Chen, and Elizabeth Park for their assistance in the sample fabrication and diamond probe gluing processes.

When coupled with a wide-area imaging sensor, it enables wide-field imaging with spatial resolution close to the optical limit, providing an innovative approach to wide-field magnetic imaging in various fields, including medical visualization, basic scientific research, and electronic circuit anomaly diagnosis. Conventionally, optical detection magnetic resonance (ODMR) enables the measurement of magnetic field for the diamond NV centers. However, obtaining the ODMR requires continuous sweeping of a long microwave bandwidth, inducing long blind area errors that limit imaging speed and reduce practical application. To mitigate ODMR sweep time, we introduce a diamond NV center microscope based on a multichannel control system (MCCS). The MCCS realizes intermittent frequency sweeping, enabling it to eliminate the ODMR transition Section and collect only segments containing spin information. This novel approach reduces acquisition time and speeds up computer solution speed. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed system, we perform magnetic field imaging of the printed circuit board (PCB). At the same testing conditions, the MCCS-based system enables six times acquisition speed compared to continuous-wave ODMR (CW-ODMR) and confidence to 95%.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","High-speed imaging; multichannel control; wide-field vector magnetic field imaging","Bandwidth; Diagnosis; Diamonds; Magnetic field measurement; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Printed circuit boards; Channels control; Field vectors; High speed imaging; Magnetic field imaging; Magnetic fields measurements; Magnetic-field; Multi channel; Multi-channel control; Sensitivity; Vector magnetic fields; Wide-field; Wide-field vector magnetic field imaging; Magnetic fields","","","","","Fund for Shanxi ""1331 Project"" Key Subjects Construction, China; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51821003, 62103385, 62175219)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62103385, Grant 62175219, and Grant 51821003; and in part by the Fund for Shanxi ""1331 Project"" Key Subjects Construction, China.","Neethirajan J.N., Et al., Controlled surface modification to revive shallow NV-centers, Nano Lett, 23, 7, pp. 2563-2569, (2023); Chen S., Et al., Digital magnetic detection of biomolecular interactions with single nanoparticles, Nano Lett, 23, 7, pp. 2636-2643, (2023); Kim L., Choi H., Trusheim M.E., Wang H., Englund D.R., Nanophotonic quantum sensing with engineered spin-optic coupling, Nanophotonics, 12, 3, pp. 441-449, (2023); Niora M., Lerche M.H., Dufva M., Berg-Sorensen K., Quantitative evaluation of the cellular uptake of nanodiamonds by monocytes and macrophages, Small, 19, 11, (2023); Reuschel P., Agio M., Flatae A.M., Vector magnetometry based on polarimetric optically detected magnetic resonance, Adv.

Among these, a problem of great significance, both fundamentally and for constructing efficient sensing networks, is that of the role of inter-sensor correlations in the simultaneous estimation of multiple linear functions, where the latter are taken over a collection local parameters and can thus be seen as global properties. In this work we provide a solution to this when each node is a qubit and the state of the network is sensor-symmetric. First we derive a general expression linking the amount of inter-sensor correlations and the geometry of the vectors associated with the functions, such that the asymptotic error is optimal. Using this we show that if the vectors are clustered around two special subspaces, then the optimum is achieved when the correlation strength approaches its extreme values, while there is a monotonic transition between such extremes for any other geometry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that entanglement can be detrimental for estimating non-trivial global properties, and that sometimes it is in fact irrelevant. Finally, we perform a non-asymptotic analysis of these results using a Bayesian approach, finding that the amount of correlations needed to enhance the precision crucially depends on the number of measurement data. Our results will serve as a basis to investigate how to harness correlations in networks of quantum sensors operating both in and out of the asymptotic regime. © 2020 The Author(s).

To obtain low core losses at high frequencies, it is important to understand the underlying mechanism. In this work, MnZn ferrites with various grain sizes were produced by changing the sintering temperature. The relationship between domain morphology, dynamic magnetization behavior, and core losses at high frequencies was carefully investigated. As the average grain size approached the critical size of single-domain state, the contribution of domain wall displacement to complex permeability decreased, while domain wall resonant frequency improved significantly, resulting in the suppression of residual loss at 3 MHz. As the average grain size increased, the domain morphology changed from a single-domain state to a multidomain state, which increased the initial permeability and decreased hysteresis loss. However, the number of domain walls increased, causing a significant decrease in the domain wall resonant frequency, and resulting in a sharp increase in residual loss. These results provide valuable insights into reducing high-frequency core losses in MnZn ferrites by domain engineering. © 2023 The American Ceramic Society.","core losses; domain morphology; grain size;

The fluorine, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen-terminated diamond (110) surfaces used for the NV centers are proposed here, and their electronic properties are investigated based on first-principles calculations. The oxygen-terminated diamond (110) surface has inter-bandgap states and surface electron spins, the nitrogen-terminated (110) surface has inter-band gap states, and the hydrogen-terminated (110) surface has negative electron affinity. Thus, these three surfaces may not be suitable for shallow NV centers. The fluorine-terminated diamond (110) surface has positive electron affinity, no surface related inter bandgap states, and no surface electron spins, so it is a promising candidate for NV-based quantum sensors. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Diamond (110) surface; Fluorine termination; Nitrogen-vacancy; Quantum sensor","Calculations; Electron affinity; Electronic properties; Electrons; Electrospinning; Energy gap; Fluorine; Hydrogen; Magnetic moments; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Quantum theory; Spin dynamics; Bandgap state; Diamond (110) surface; First principle calculations; Fluorine termination; Low index; Negative electron affinity; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Positive electron affinities; Quantum sensors; Diamonds","","","","","Guandong Basic and Applied Basic Research Fund, (2020B1515120005); Science and Technology Facilities Council, STFC, (ST/T006455/1); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51727901, 62004141)","This work is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51727901 , 62004141 ), the Guandong Basic and Applied Basic Research Fund: Guangdong-Shenzhen Joint Fund ( 2020B1515120005 ), and the Science and Technology Facilities Council ( ST/T006455/1 ).

In this framework, many applications also require high spatial resolution magnetic measurements for biomedical research, environmental monitoring and industrial production. In this regard, optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are considered as prominent candidates, but are impaired in size with micrometer scale magnetic particles, e.g. magnetic droplets. In order to address this limitation, here we study the effects of adding a micrometer-to-millimeter magnetic guide to a miniature OPM. This device is applied to detect Fe3O4 magnetic droplets flowing at rates up to 25 drop. s−1 in a microfluidic channel. The computed spatial resolution is 300 µm and the measured signal-to-noise ratio is larger than 15 dB for the different sizes of considered magnetic droplets. © 2023 The Author(s).

The wide bandwidth requirement often necessitates high laser power, but this induces significant laser fluctuation noise that affects the detection magnetic field resolution severely. Therefore, enhancement of the magnetic field resolution of wide-bandwidth NV center magnetic sensors is highly important because of the reciprocal effects of the bandwidth and magnetic field resolution. In this article, we develop a common mode rejection (CMR) model to eliminate the laser noise effectively. The simulation results show that the noise level of the light-detected magnetic resonance signal is significantly reduced by a factor of 6.2 after applying the CMR technique. After optimization of the laser power and modulation frequency parameters, the optimal system bandwidth was found to be 75 Hz. Simultaneously, the system’s detection magnetic field resolution was enhanced significantly, increasing from 4.49 nT/Hz1/2 to 790.8 pT/Hz1/2, which represents an improvement of nearly 5.7 times. This wide-bandwidth, high-magnetic field resolution NV color center magnetic sensor will have applications including power systems, geomagnetic navigation, and diamond NV color center current transformers. © 2023 by the authors.","bandwidth; common mode rejection; magnetic field resolution; NV center","Color; Color centers; Electric instrument transformers; Geomagnetism; Magnetic field effects; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic sensors; Nitrogen; Colour centers; Common-mode rejection; Geomagnetic navigation; High magnetic fields; Magnetic-field resolution; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Noise suppression; Power; Wide bandwidth; Diamonds","","","","","Shanxi Outstanding Youth Fund, (202103021221007); Shanxi province key laboratory of quantum sensing and precision measurement, (201905D121001, 202204041101015); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62220106012); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFC2204104)","This research was funded by the International Cooperation and Exchange Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (62220106012), Shanxi Outstanding Youth Fund (202103021221007), Shanxi province key laboratory of quantum sensing and precision measurement (201905D121001), Shanxi international joint laboratory of quantum sensing and precision measurement (202204041101015), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFC2204104).","Xie Y., Yu H., Zhu Y., Qin X., Rong X., Duan C.-K., Du J., A hybrid magnetometer towards femtotesla sensitivity under ambient conditions, Sci.

The validity of this postulate was and is currently tested in different groups with different systems. Among this multitude of methods atom interferometry is considered to be one of the most promising tools in performing high-precision measurements [2]. Using two atom species in free fall with different masses allows comparing two independent measurements of g. This is made possible by creating a mixture of two atomic species at a temperature close to absolute zero. This regime is suitable for the observation of matter waves at long time scales needed for high-precision quantum tests. In this letter an overview of the developments of our quantum sensor devices is done. The up-to-date progress and future prospects in our group of these ambitious and technically challenging projects are briefly presented as well. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Some of the reactions they catalyze are associated with a change in reagents chirality, hence their activity can be tracked by using optical means. However, illumination affects enzyme activity: the challenge is to operate at low-intensity regime avoiding loss in sensitivity. Here we apply quantum phase estimation to real-time measurement of invertase enzymatic activity. Control of the probe at the quantum level demonstrates the potential for reducing invasiveness with optimized sensitivity at once. This preliminary effort, bringing together methods of quantum physics and biology, constitutes an important step towards full development of quantum sensors for biological systems. © 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.","","beta-Fructofuranosidase; Lasers; Light; Photons; Quantum Theory; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Enzyme activity; beta fructofuranosidase; Adaptive tracking; Enzymatic activities; Enzymatic reaction; Quantum levels; Quantum phase estimation; Quantum physics; Quantum sensors; Real time measurements; enzymology; laser; light; metabolism; photon; quantum theory; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Quantum theory","","beta fructofuranosidase, 9001-57-4; beta-Fructofuranosidase, ","","","","","Cooper G.M., The Cell: A Molecular Approach, (2000); Choi J.M., Han S.S., Kim H., Industrial applications of enzyme biocatalysis: Current status and future aspects, Biotechnol.

Photosynthetic microorganisms, in order to develop and grow, require a species-specific type of visible light radiation. The automation of the lighting system was based on the industrial PLC Modicon TM221C24T controller according to the submitted and received patent No. 242154. The system was integrated with a quantum sensor, which allows for setting the colour of light and controlling the intensity and exposure time based on protocols set by the operator. The data obtained from the PAR photosynthetically active radiation sensor make it possible to adjust the distribution of light to the actual needs of the culture’s radiant energy. The unit also allows for remote control of multiculture farms. It allows you to simulate sunrise and sunset using the astronomical clock function set for a given species of microalgae. Ultimately, the work was undertaken on the implementation and use of a system for measuring the light spectrum at each point of the bioreactor using a fibre-optic immersion probe. © 2023 by the authors.","DMX controller gate; immersion sensor; microalgae; Modbus RTU; PAR photosynthetic active radiation; photobioreactor; quantum sensor","Automation; Controllers; Light sources; Lighting fixtures; Microorganisms; Photobioreactors; Remote control; DMX controller gate; Immersion sensor; Light distribution; Lighting systems; Micro-algae; Modbus RTU; PAR photosynthetic active radiation; Photobiore-actor; Photosynthetic active radiations; Quantum sensors; Microalgae","","","","","Ministry of Education and Science for the Agricultural University of Hugo Kołłątaj in Krakow","This paper was financed from the subsidy of the Ministry of Education and Science for the Agricultural University of Hugo Kołłątaj in Krakow for the year 2023.","Jin J., Dupre C., Legrand J., Grizeau D., Extracellular hydrocarbon and intracellular lipid accumulation are related to nutrient-sufficient conditions in pH-controlled chemostat cultures of the microalga Botryococcus braunii SAG 30.81, Algal Res, 17, pp. 244-252, (2016); Sharma J., Kumar S.S., Bishnoi N.R., Pugazhendhi A., Enhancement of lipid production from algal biomass through various growth parameters, J.

However, when trying to detect weak signals that are hidden by background noise, the signal-to-noise ratio is a more relevant metric than raw sensitivity. We identify, under modest assumptions about the statistical properties of the signal and noise, the optimal quantum control to detect an external signal in the presence of background noise using a quantum sensor. Interestingly, for white background noise, the optimal solution is the simple and well-known spin-locking control scheme. Using numerical techniques, we further generalize these results to the case of background noise with a Lorentzian spectrum. We show that for increasing correlation time, pulse based sequences, such as CPMG, are also close to the optimal control for detecting the signal, with the crossover dependent on the signal frequency. These results show that an optimal detection scheme can be easily implemented in near-term quantum sensors without the need for complicated pulse shaping. © 2021, The Author(s).","","Pulse shaping; Quantum theory; Signal detection; Signal to noise ratio; Estimating parameters; External perturbations; Lorentzian spectrum; Numerical techniques; Optimal detection; Optimal quantum control; Signal frequencies; Statistical properties; Correlation detectors","","","","","ARO-MURI; Applied Physics Laboratory; National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Army Research Office, ARO; Office of Science, SC; Advanced Scientific Computing Research, ASCR, (ERKJ347)","The authors would like to thank Mohammad Hafezi, Jeff Barnes, Colin Trout, and Timothy Sweeney for useful discussions.

We introduce the standard quantum limit for data capacity, and experimentally observe quantum-limited data reception for bandwidths from 10 kHz up to 30 MHz. In doing this, we provide a useful alternative to classical communication antennas, which become increasingly ineffective when the size of the antenna is significantly smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic field. © 2018 American Physical Society.

Here we conducted numerical simulations of SCPW resonators to investigate the relationship between the Q factor and the coupling capacitance of the resonator. Varying the geometrical shape of both ends and coupling parameters of the SCPW resonator resulted in a change of the coupling capacitances and the Q factor as well. Our calculation results indicate that the performance of the SCPW resonator is highly sensitive to the capacitive coupling and searching for an optimal coupling condition would be crucial for developing high-performance SCPW resonator. © 2021, Korea Institute of Applied Superconductivity and Cryogenics.

On the other hand it leads to an utilization of ultracold quantum matter techniques in unique practical applications. We report on the first establishments of atom optical experiments in the gravitation-free conditions at the Drop Tower Bremen in Germany, a facility of the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM). The chosen drop tower has an easy access to low gravity on earth with a daily usage, a more than sufficient time of free fall for experiments in quantum regimes (about 4s in drop mode and about 9s in catapult mode) and a well quality of weightlessness of 10-6g. Our report demonstrates the results of the precursor pilot project ATKAT (""atom catapult"") and the current pilot project QUANTUS (""quantum systems under weightlesness"") . The pure technological experiment ATKAT could successfully realize a compact and robust setup for trapping and cooling neutral rubidium atoms ( 87Rb) in microgravity conditions. After ATKAT's test accomplishment we have started the parallel developed QUANTUS main pilot projekt to investigate quantum degenerated gases in free fall. The first Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a weightless environment world wide and longest evolution times of the 87Rb BEC up to 1s could be achieved within the science experiment QUANTUS. In respect thereof our collaboration opens further opportunities in atom optics. At least we will give an outlook of the new QUANTUS II project and its supporting project PRIMUS (""precision interferometry with matter waves under weightlessness"") aiming on a precise inertial sensor by using an atom interferometer under weightlessness.","","Drops; Experiments; Gravitational effects; Interferometers; Microgravity processing; Particle optics; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Rubidium; Statistical mechanics; Steam condensers; Towers; Weightlessness; Atom interferometer; Atom optics; Bose-Einstein condensates; Drop towers; Free fall; Fundamental physics; Germany; Inertial sensor; Low gravity; Matter waves; Microgravity conditions; Optical experiments; Pilot projects; Precision measurement; Quantum matter; Quantum regimes; Quantum system; Rubidium atoms; Science experiments; Space technologies; Ultra-cold; Weightless environment; Atoms","","","","","","","Phillips W.D., Metcalf H.J., Cooling and Trapping Atoms, Scientific American, (1987); Cohen-Tannoudji C.N., Phillips W.D., New Mechanisms for Laser Cooling, Physics Today, (1990); Chu S., Laser Trapping of Neutral Particles, Scientific American, (1992); Anderson M.H., Ensher J.R., Matthews M.R., Wieman C.E., Cornell E.A., Observation of Bose-Einstein Condensation in a Dilute Atomic Vapor, Science, 269, 5221, pp. 198-201, (1995); Davis K.B., Mewes M.-O., Andrews M.R., Van Druten N.J., Durfee D.S., Kurn D.M., Ketterle W., Bose-Einstein Condensation in a Gas of Sodium Atoms, Phys.

To provide this knowledge and assessment, this study identifies technology innovations being developed and advanced in government, industry, and academia that are impactful and relevant to NASA. This paper showcases specific emerging and disruptive technologies within specific disciplines, including artificial intelligence, miniaturized systems, autonomous systems, big data analytics, machine learning and advanced engineered materials. These areas could provide breakthrough solutions that would enable NASA missions and enhance specific industries. This paper also describes how nearly 500 technology trends from around the world covering a broad spectrum of technology areas were identified, verified, and assessed by the NASA Center Chief Technologist Council, Technology Trends team. From the trends collected, Center Chief Technologist selected nine ""high interest"" emerging and disruptive technology areas. Agency leadership can use this overview of innovative technology development outside NASA to identify transformational technologies; foster collaborations within and outside the air and space domains; and assess when to make, buy, lead, leverage, adopt, or watch key transformational technologies. This assessment could be used also to identify partnerships and to enable breakthrough progress toward enabling exploration missions. Ultimately, NASA can leverage the analysis of this study and make decisions regarding investments internal and external to the Agency.

Due to the well-organized silver nano-grating, the edges of colloidal diamond drop-casted on the silver nano-grating substrate have been arranged as the straightforward lines. And, the diamond nanowire would be manufactured along this line at the tip of silver nano-grating based on the coffee-ring effect. Because of the tip effect and the surface plasma resonance effect at the tip of silver nano-grating, the fluorescence and the quantum efficient have improved about 10 times.

The photodynamics and sensitivity of spin defects are governed by their level structure and associated transition rates. These are, however, poorly understood for spin defects in hBN. Here, optical and microwave pump-probe measurements are used to characterize the relaxation dynamics of the negatively charged boron vacancy (VB−)—the most widely-studied spin defect in hBN. A 5-level model is used to deduce transition rates that give rise to spin-dependent VB− photoluminescence, and the lifetime of the VB− intersystem crossing metastable state. The obtained rates are used to simulate the magnetic field sensitivity of VB− defects and demonstrate high resolution imaging of the magnetic field generated by a single magnetic particle using optimal sensing parameters predicted by the model. The results reveal the rates that underpin VB− photodynamics, which is important for both a fundamental understanding of the VB− as a spin-photon interface and for achieving optimal sensitivity in quantum sensing applications. © 2023 The Authors.

Reliable simulation models are required to design complex circuits, but CMOS transistor electrical characteristics at cryogenic temperatures substantially deviate from the behavior at room temperature, and no standard physics-based model exists for cryo-CMOS devices. To circumvent those limitations, this paper proposes the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and an associated training (extraction) procedure that automatically generates cryo-CMOS device models directly from experimental data. A device model for the DC characteristics of 40-nm CMOS transistors over a wide range of bias conditions, device geometries and temperatures from 4 K to 300 K has been generated and used to simulate voltage-reference circuits over a wide temperature range (4 K - 300 K). The potential application to dynamic/high-frequency circuits is demonstrated by enhancing the basic model with ANN-based nonlinear multi-terminal capacitive elements to simulate a ring oscillator. Preliminary results showing a good match between simulations and experiments demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed approach.  © 2021 IEEE.","CMOS integrated circuits; cryo-CMOS; cryogenics; quantum computing; quantum sensing; semiconductor device models","CMOS integrated circuits; Cryogenics; Neural networks; Oscillators (electronic); Timing circuits; Transistors; Artificial neural network modeling; CMOS devices; CMOS transistors; Cryo-CMOS; Cryogenic temperatures; Device modelling; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Quantum sensing; Quantum sensors; Quantum computers","","","","","Intel Corporation","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank the legal teams of the TU Delft and Keysight Technologies, and Keysight Laboratories and Keysight Quantum Engineering Solutions organizations for encouragement and support.

This advantage, however, relies on refined data postprocessing, assessed based on the variance of the estimated parameter. When Bayesian techniques are adopted, more elements become available for assessing the quality of the estimation. Here we adopt generalized classical Cramér-Rao bounds for looking in detail into a phase-estimation experiment performed with quantum light. In particular, we show that the third-order absolute moment can give a superior capability in revealing biases in the estimation, compared to standard approaches. Our studies point to the identification of an alternative strategy that brings a possible advantage in monitoring the correct operation of high-precision sensors. © 2020 American Physical Society.","","Bayesian techniques; Data post-processing; Estimated parameter; High-precision; Phase estimation; Quantum metrology; Quantum resources; Quantum sensors","","","","","Dipartimenti di Eccellenza, (B81I18001170001); Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; Amaldi Research Center, ARC","We thank A.

Specific light frequencies in the 400- to 700-nm range have been shown to affect photosynthesis more directly than other wavelengths (especially in the red and blue ranges). Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) could diminish lighting costs as a result of their high efficiency, lower operating temperatures, and wavelength specificity. LEDs can be selected to target the wavelengths used by plants, enabling growers to customize the light produced, to enable maximum plant production and limit wavelengths that do not significantly impact plant growth. In our experiment, hydroponically grown tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) were grown using a full factorial design with three light intensities (high: 135 μmol·m-2·s-1, medium: 115 μmol·m-2·s-1, and low: 100 μmol·m-2·s-1) at three red (661 nm) to blue (449 nm) ratio levels (5:1, 10:1, and 19:1). Secondary treatments for comparison were 100% HPS, 100% red LED light supplied from above the plant, 100% red LED light supplied below the plant, a 50%:50%LED:HPS mixture, and a control (no supplemental lighting). Both runs of the experiment lasted 120 days during the Summer-Fall 2011 and the Winter-Spring 2011-12. The highest biomass production (excluding fruit) occurred with the 19:1 ratio (red to blue) with increasing intensity resulting in more growth, whereas a higher fruit production was obtained using the 5:1 ratio. The highestmarketable fruit production (fruit over 90 g) was obtained with the 50%:50%LED:HPS followed by 5:1 high and 19:1 high. Consistently the 5:1 high performed well in every category. LEDs have been shown to be superior in fruit production over HPS alone, and LEDs can improve tomato fruit production when mixed with HPS. LEDs provide a promising mechanism to enhance greenhouse artificial lighting systems.","High-pressure sodium; Intercanopy lighting; Photosynthesis; Supplemental lighting","","","","","","","","Apogee pyranometer technical information, (2012); Apogee quantum sensor technical information, (2012); Moisture measurement-Forages, (2007); Boccalandro H., Giordano C., Ploschuk E., Piccoli P., Bottini R., Casal J., Phototropins but not cryptochromes mediate the blue light-specific promotion of stomatal conductance, while both enhance photosynthesis and transpiration under full sunlight, Plant Physiol., 158, pp. 1475-1484, (2012); Brazaityte A., Duchovskis P., Urbonaviciute A., Samuoliene S., Jankauskiene J., Kazenas V., Kasiuleviciute-Bonakere A., Bliznikas Z., Noviekovas A., Breive K., Zukauskas A., After-effect of light emitting diodes lighting on tomato growth and yield in greenhouse, Sodininkystė ir Daržininkystė, 28, pp. 115-126, (2009); Brown C., Schuerger A., Sager J., Growth and photomorphogenesis of pepper plants under red light-emitting diodes with supplemental blue or far-red lighting, J.

TDM and CDM circuits are produced by the Boulder Microfabrication Facility in large quantities and in multiple varieties to meet the needs of various bolometric and calorimetric applications. In most cases, the basic functionality of these devices must be verified before they are passed along to internal or external collaborators for integration into scientific instruments. We have developed a test bed that utilizes the NIST TDM/CDM read-out electronics to make automated multiplexed measurements on sixteen devices simultaneously in a 4 K liquid-helium dip probe. The optimization of the measurement process has resulted in vastly improved throughput and enhanced data products. We present a thorough analysis of results from the application of the test process to flux-activated-switch-style multiplexers. The utility of this approach in identifying fabrication trends, yield indicators, and common failure modes will be demonstrated. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","Cryogenic electronics; superconducting integrated circuits; superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs)","Code division multiple access; Cryogenics; Liquefied gases; Molluscs; Multiplexing equipment; Quantum interference devices; Shellfish; SQUIDs; Superconducting devices; Superfluid helium; Testing; Code division multiplexing; Cryogenic electronics; Measurement process; Readout Electronics; Scientific instrument; Superconducting integrated circuits; Superconducting Quantum Interference Device multiplexers; Transition-edge sensors; Time division multiplexing","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","Manuscript received October 30, 2018; accepted March 4, 2019.

The validity of this postulate was and is currently tested in different groups with different systems. Among this multitude atom interferometry is considered to be one of the most powerful tools in performing high-precision measurements [2]. Using two atom species in free fall with different masses allows comparing two independent measurements of g. This is made possible by creating simultaneously in a single experiment a mixture of two atomic species at a temperature close to the absolute zero. This regime is suitable to the observation of matter waves at long time scales needed for quantum tests. In this letter an overview of the last developments of these quantum sensors is done. The up-to-date progress and future prospects in our group of these ambitious and technically challenging projects will be presented as well.","","Equivalence classes; Interferometry; Relativity; Absolute zero; Atom interferometry; Atomic species; Different mass; Equivalence principles; Free fall; Future prospects; General theory of relativity; High-precision measurement; Independent measurement; Matter waves; Quantum sensors; Time-scales; Weak equivalence principle; Atoms","","","","","German Space Agency DLR; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie, BMWi, (DLR 50 WM 0346)","The QUANTUS project is supported by the German Space Agency DLR with funds provided by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) under Grant no.

Expanding this concept above 100 GPa appears to be a substantial challenge. We observe that deviatoric stress on the anvil tip sets a limit at 40-50 GPa for practical magnetic measurements based on the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of NV centers under pressure. We show that this limit can be circumvented up to at least 130 GPa by machining a micropillar on the anvil tip to create a quasihydrostatic stress environment for the NV centers. Improved hydrostaticity is quantified using the pressure dependence of the diamond Raman shift, the NV ODMR dependence on applied magnetic field, and NV photoluminescence spectral shift. This paves the way for the reliable use of NV microsensing at pressures above 100 GPa.  © 2023 American Physical Society.","","High pressure engineering; Magnetic resonance; Magnetometers; Nitrogen; Deviatoric stress; Diamond anvil; Extreme pressure; High pressure measurements; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Optically detected magnetic resonance; Quantum sensors; Sensors array; Superconducting properties; Magnetometry","","","","","EquipEx  program, (ANR-21-ESRE-0031); European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research, EMPIR; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR; Institut Universitaire de France, IUF; Horizon 2020, (20IND05 QADeT)","Acknowledgments.

In our recent paper, we showed that the entanglement-assisted (EA) joint monostatic–bistatic quantum radar performs much better than conventional radars. Here, we propose an entanglement-assisted (EA) multistatic radar that significantly outperforms EA bistatic, coherent state-based quantum, and classical radars. The proposed EA multistatic radar employs multiple entangled transmitters performing transmit-side optical phase conjugation, multiple coherent detection-based receivers serving as EA detectors, and a joint detector. © 2022 by the author.","entanglement; entanglement-assisted detection; quantum radars; quantum sensing; radars","","","","","","","","Holevo A.S., Werner R.F., Evaluating capacities of Bosonic Gaussian channels, Phys.
