Therefore, early classification of it is a crucial task. Quantum machine learning and quantum neural network models can play an effective role in multiclass classification problems. Compared to standard deep and machine learning classifiers, the quantum variational classifier may lead to less memory usage, accuracy, and portability for respiratory disease detection. This article proposes a hybrid respiratory lung disease detection framework based on classical CNN and Quantum classifiers. It combines a classical deep feature extraction model with quantum classifiers. A new custom convolutional neural network (CCNN) deep learning model is proposed to perform feature extraction, and the Multi-Multi-Single (MMS) & Multi-Single-Multi-Single (MSMS) are proposed as quantum machine learning algorithms. These two quantum classifiers are built via a quantum variational circuit with encoding, entanglement, and measurement properties. The tests were carried out on the COVID-19 Radiography Dataset (CRD), which contains 15,153 chest X-ray images of COVID-19, Viral, and Normal. The experimental results revealed that the proposed model had the highest training and testing accuracy of 98.9% and 98.1%, on the CRD dataset, with a computation cost of 0.07 and 0.08 respectively. This hybrid model performs better than the other standard deep learning models. Additionally, we validated our MMS and MSMS quantum classifiers by deploying them on the IBM Q-QASM real-time quantum computer. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Convolutional neural network; Feature extraction; Quantum classifier; Quantum machine learning; Qubits","Biological organs; Chemical detection; Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Statistical tests; Convolutional neural network; Disease detection; Features extraction; Human respiratory system; Hybrid framework; Learning models; Machine-learning; Quantum classifier; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; accuracy; Article; artificial neural network; classifier; comparative study; conceptual framework; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; cost; covid 19 radiography dataset; deep learning; encoding; entanglement; experimental model; feature extraction; hybrid framework; lung disease; machine learning; measurement; memory; multi multi single algorithm; multi single multi single algorithm; multiclass classification; nonhuman; physical parameters; quantum classifier; quantum mechanics; quantum variational circuit; radiological parameters; residual neural network; thorax radiography; training; Feature extraction","","","M.F.

This kind of disturbance can hinder a timely resequencing, and an improper resequencing scheme would increase the total production costs and delivery delays. To tackle this problem, a collaborative resequencing approach for a MSAFS is proposed enabled by a multi-core promising-region evolutionary algorithm (PREA) to deal with emergency orders for an efficient optimization of resequencing during the automotive production. First, considering the characteristics of automotive production, a sliding window-based collaborative resequencing strategy is proposed to cope with emergency orders. Then, a model that integrates the welding, painting, and assembly processes is described mathematically to minimize production costs and delivery delays. Next, a multi-core PREA is developed to optimize the collaborative resequencing model with high efficiency. Finally, a case study is conducted to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed approach. The numerical results indicate that the proposed approach is capable of realizing an effective resequencing optimization with high computational performance in terms of handling emergency orders for automotive production. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative resequencing strategy; Emergency order; Multi-core promising-region evolutionary algorithm (PREA); Multi-stage automotive flow shop (MSAFS)","Costs; Machine shop practice; Automotive production; Automotives; Collaborative resequencing strategy; Emergency order; Flow-shops; Multi-core promising-region evolutionary algorithm; Multi-cores; Multi-stage automotive flow shop; Multi-stages; Resequencing; Evolutionary algorithms","Chongqing Technology Innovation and Application Program, (cstc2020jscx-msxmX0221); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975075); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFB1706103)","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2019YFB1706103), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51975075), and the Chongqing Technology Innovation and Application Program (No. cstc2020jscx-msxmX0221).

Hence, fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) have also been applied as nanoscale sensors. This chapter focuses on a new field of research on the basis of a biophysical groundwork for quantum sensing. It highlights several diverse and exciting applications enabled by these novel quantum sensors, including magnetic field sensing, orientation tracking, nanothermometry, and nanoscopic spin probes. The NV spin has a very long coherence time, making FND suitable for ultrasensitive measurements for temperature, magnetic field, and mechanical stress at the nanoscale. Due to their high responsivity to external magnetic fields, NV centers have been widely used for magnetic sensing. NV sensors are also ideal for bio-oriented nanoscale magnetic sensing and imaging owing to their biocompatibility.

In previous oil source alternatives study, corn oil (CO) had been found to induce gut inflammation, while olive oil (OO) had been found to be effective in protecting intestinal health. Three diets with different oil sources (fish oil, CO, OO) were formulated for an 8-week culture experiment, and it was proposed to combine 16S sequencing and transcriptome sequencing analysis to preliminarily elucidate the damage/protection mechanism of CO and OO on the gut health of grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ E. lanceolatu). We found that CO indeed damaged to gut health and destroyed the gut structure, while OO had a positive outcome in protecting the gut structure, promoting digestibility and relieving enteritis. Photobacterium, Romboutsia and Epulopiscium were significantly enriched in OO group and Staphylococcus were significantly enriched in CO group. Transcriptome sequencing further revealed CO could activated Complement and coagulation cascades, Staphylococcus aureus infection, Systemic lupus erythematosus, and Tuberculosis pathways; conversely, OO activated B-cell signaling receptors, promoted B-cell proliferation and apoptosis, and thus activated B-cell signaling pathways to enhance immunity, whereas OO can regulate IL17 signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway to inhibit NF-κB signaling pathway to reduce pro-inflammatory response. By integrating the microbiome and transcriptome, further identified all differential microorganisms were directly and significantly correlated with differential genes, and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Romboutsia, Staphylococcus might as the core regulates the expression of differential gene in the organism. These results reveal that different oil sources alter gut gene expression mainly by modulating the composition and abundance of gut microbiota, further regulating the health status of the gut. Gut microbiota could be used as biomarkers to provide reference and solutions for the mitigation of inflammation in aquatic animals. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Corn oil; Fish oil; Gut; Microbiome; Olive oil; Transcriptome","Bacteria; Cell proliferation; Cell signaling; Fish; Gene expression; Olive oil; Pathology; Pigments; Signaling; amylase; B lymphocyte receptor; corn oil; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 17; olive oil; transcriptome; triacylglycerol lipase; trypsin; tumor necrosis factor; B cells; Corn oil; Fish oil; Gut; Gut healths; Health status; Microbiome; Oil sources; Signalling pathways; Transcriptomes; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; antioxidant activity; apoptosis; Article; B lymphocyte; bacterium; blood clotting; cell proliferation; clinical outcome; Clostridium; complement activation; controlled study; diet; differential gene expression; digestion; drug mechanism; enteritis; enzyme activity; Epinephelus; Epinephelus fuscoguttatus; Epinephelus lanceolatu; Epulopiscium; gene expression regulation; genetic correlation; gut health; health; immunity; intestine flora; intestine injury; microbiome; nonhuman; Photobacterium; prediction; protection; regulatory mechanism; Romboutsia; sequence analysis; signal transduction; Staphylococcus; transcriptome sequencing; transcriptomics; Cell death","MARA, (CARS-47); Postgraduate Education Innovation Project of Guangdong Ocean University, (202139, 2021B0202050002); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1515011165); Agriculture Research System of China; Department of Education of Guangdong Province, DEGP, (2021ZDZX4005); Science and Technology Bureau of Zhenjiang, (2022A01026)","This study was supported financially by the General Program of Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province ( 2021A1515011165 ), Department of Education of Guangdong Province ( 2021ZDZX4005 ), Postgraduate Education Innovation Project of Guangdong Ocean University ( 202139 ), Research and Demonstration of Precision Functional Compound Feed Technology of Major Cultured Fishes and Shrimps in South China ( 2021B0202050002 ), Science and Technology Bureau of Zhanjiang ( 2022A01026 ), and the China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA ( CARS-47 ).

This observation directly provides a quantum Rényi-p entropy power inequality over a quasi-probability distribution for D-mode bosonic Gaussian regimes. The proposed inequality is expected to be useful for the nontrivial computing of quantum channel capacities, particularly universal upper bounds on bosonic Gaussian quantum channels, and a Gaussian entanglement witness in the case of Gaussian amplifier via squeezing operations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Bosonic Gaussian system; Quantum channel capacity; Quantum convolution; Quantum Rényi entropy power inequality; Wehrl-p entropy","Bosons; Channel capacity; Communication channels (information theory); Convolution; Gaussian distribution; Quantum entanglement; Bosonic gaussian system; Entropy power inequalities; Functionals; Gaussian systems; Power; Quantum channel capacities; Quantum convolution; Quantum renyi entropy power inequality; Renyi's entropy; Wehrl-p entropy; Entropy","Ministry of Education, MOE, (NRF-2021R1I1A1A01042199); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (NRF-2020M3E4A1077861, NRF-2022M3H3A1098237); Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, KISTI, (P23031); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","The authors thank to anonymous reviewer's valuable comments.

Due to dynamical topological changes in quantum networks, nodes have to construct the shortest paths every time they want to communicate with a remote neighbour. But due to the entanglement failures remote entanglement establishment is still a challenging task. Also as the nodes know only about their neighbouring nodes computing optimal paths between source and remote nodes is time consuming too. In finding the next best neighbour in the optimal path between a given source and remote nodes so as to decrease the entanglement cost, deep learning techniques can be applied. In this paper we defined throughput of the quantum network as the maximum qubits transmitted with minimum entanglement cost. Much of research work is done to improve the throughput of the quantum network using the deep learning techniques. In this paper we adopted deep learning techniques for implementing remote entanglement between two non-neighbour nodes using remote qubit teleportation and entanglement swapping. The proposed method called Optimal Remote Qubit Teleportation outperforms the throughput obtained by the state of art approach. © 2023, Strojarski Facultet.

However, the impinging electrons typically excite more than one pixel of the device, and an efficient algorithm is therefore needed to convert the measured pixel hits to real single-electron events. Here we present a robust clustering algorithm that is fast enough to find clusters in a continuous stream of raw data in real time. Each tuple of position and arrival time from the detector is continuously compared to a buffer of previous hits until the probability of a merger with an old event becomes irrelevant. In this way, the computation time becomes independent of the density of electron arrival and the algorithm does not break the operation chain. We showcase the performance of the algorithm with a ‘timepix’ camera in two regimes of electron microscopy, in continuous beam emission and laser-triggered femtosecond mode. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Cluster algorithm; Direct electron detector; Femtosecond electron pulses; Poisson statistics","Electron energy levels; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Electron microscopes; Electron microscopy; Electron scattering; Electrons; Energy dissipation; Pixels; Quantum optics; Readout systems; Cluster algorithms; Clusterings; Direct electron detector; Electron detectors; Event-driven; Femtosecond electron pulse; Hybrid pixel detectors; Poisson statistic; Real- time; Time-resolution; Article; chronology; clustering algorithm; density; detection algorithm; electron; electron energy loss spectroscopy; electron microscopy; probability; quantum optics; Clustering algorithms","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (SFB 1432)","This research was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) via SFB 1432 .","P.

To facilitate the use of our recently published ML-based approaches for quantum dissipative dynamics, here we present an open-source Python package MLQD (https://github.com/Arif-PhyChem/MLQD), which currently supports the three ML-based quantum dynamics approaches: (1) the recursive dynamics with kernel ridge regression (KRR) method, (2) the non-recursive artificial-intelligence-based quantum dynamics (AIQD) approach and (3) the blazingly fast one-shot trajectory learning (OSTL) approach, where both AIQD and OSTL use the convolutional neural networks (CNN). This paper describes the features of the MLQD package, the technical details, optimization of hyperparameters, visualization of results, and the demonstration of the MLQD's applicability for two widely studied systems, namely the spin-boson model and the Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) complex. To make MLQD more user-friendly and accessible, we have made it available on the Python Package Index (PyPi) platform and it can be installed via [Formula presented]. In addition, it is also available on the XACS cloud computing platform (https://XACScloud.com) via the interface to the MLATOM package (http://MLatom.com).

Solution method: We have developed MLQD as a comprehensive framework that streamlines and supports the implementation of our recently published machine learning-based approaches for efficient propagation of quantum dissipative dynamics. This framework encompasses: (1) the recursive dynamics with kernel ridge regression (KRR) method, as well as the non-recursive approaches utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNN), namely (2) artificial intelligence-based quantum dynamics (AIQD), and (3) one-shot trajectory learning (OSTL). Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: 1. Users can train a machine learning (ML) model following one of the ML-based approaches: KRR, AIQD and OSTL. 2. Users have the option to propagate dynamics with the existing trained ML models. 3. MLQD also provides the transformation of trajectories into the training data. 4. MLQD also supports hyperparameter optimization using MLATOM's grid search functionality for KRR and Bayesian methods with Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) for CNN models via the HYPEROPT package. 5. MLQD also facilitates the visualization of results via auto-plotting. 6. MLQD is designed to be user-friendly and easily accessible, with availability on the XACS cloud computing platform (https://XACScloud.com) via the interface to the MLATOM package (http://MLatom.com). In addition, it is also available as a pip package which makes it easy to install.

The existing methods use hybrid algorithms using AI techniques, but the result is not favorable, therefore, to get a precise result, the methodology is focused on techniques based on quantum computing. The technique to identify disease in a plant varies from leaf to leaf, but the base disease remains the same. Defects like yellow, black, and white spots are common problems. The fungi disease takes the energy from the plants in which they live, this leads to conditions like wilting, scabs, moldy coatings, rusts, blotches, and rotted tissues. All these problems have different existing solutions, through this research work, a minimal fault detection method is identified to reduce the flaws in the paddy crop. As the initial step, paddy crops are taken for research work; later, this can be extended to wheat and maize. The focus is on a hybrid approach of quantum computing and AI as quantum computing techniques help to spot patterns in large data sets. The concept of quantum image processing will help to elaborate the images of a leaf to identify its defect. QIP uses high varied quantum lattice methods to identify clear leaf images by reducing noise and paving the way to identify the discolored leaf at a minimal time. quantum computing possibly paves way for new opportunities in the techniques of Artificial Intelligence, for better predictions and decision-making involving a combination of large data collected from various resources, to produce very clear results. This research work aims to solve the problem of proper identification of paddy crops by studying the image carefully with the designed algorithms to achieve better results that lead to better productivity. The image detection helps to trigger the crop production by routine test work on the image captured thus optimizing the consistency and accuracy. This work also helps to detect the related issues during image computation using image classification techniques. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG. 2024.","AI techniques; Crop production; fungi; Lattice methods; Main field diseases; Nursery diseases; QIP; QIS","Big data; Cultivation; Decision making; Defects; Fault detection; Fungi; Quantum computers; AI techniques; Computing techniques; Crop production; Lattice methods; Leaf disease; Main field disease; Nursery disease; QIP; QIS; Quantum Computing; Crops","","","A.P.

However, Ga and Ge primarily occur as associated minerals. The process involves the leaching of lead–zinc ores and subsequent leaching to recover the valuable elements. The conventional acid leaching procedure exhibits low leaching effectiveness for Ga and Ge, making their recovery challenging. This study initially investigated the occurrence states of Ga and Ge. The thermodynamic simulations were used to investigate the feasibility of Zinc powder replacement residue (ZPRR) in a two-stage acid leaching process. The leaching mechanism in the strong magnetic field and ultrasonic field was studied using several characterizations such as XRD, SEM, XPS, FT-IR, etc. The investigation revealed that raising the temperature in the acidic solution led to an enhanced leaching efficiency of Ga and Ge. However, at 120 °C, the leaching efficiency of Ge decreased due to the hydrolytic precipitation occurring between Ge and SiO2. Nevertheless, the utilisation of a strong magnetic field proved advantageous in impeding this process. Furthermore, the application of the combined ultrasonic field contributed to enhancing the level of residue refining, hence promoting the effectiveness and degree of the reaction. Thus, the leaching efficiency of Ga and Ge was influenced by temperature, strong magnetic field, and ultrasonic field in combination. The high leaching efficiency of 95.53 % and 97.11 % for Ga and Ge, respectively, could be attained in the optimal experimental parameters. This study offers theoretical guidance for the effective and environmentally friendly leaching of Ga and Ge. Furthermore, it has been observed that this method is also promising for leaching the other valuable metals. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Gallium, Germanium; Oxygen pressure acid leaching; Strong magnetic field; Ultrasound; Zinc powder replacement residue","Efficiency; Gallium; Germanium; Leaching; Magnetic fields; Ores; Oxygen; Silica; Gallium, germania; Germaniums (Ge); High tech industry; Oxygen pressure acid leaching; Strategic resource; Strong magnetic fields; Ultrasonic field; Zinc powder; Zinc powder replacement residue; Ultrasonics","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52004156, 52204347, 52204392, 52274385); China Academy of Space Technology, CAST, (2022QNRC001); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFC2904900)","This study was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2022YFC2904900 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52204392 , 52274385 , 52004156 , and 52204347 ), and the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (No. 2022QNRC001 ).

Regarding the achievements of optimization calculations, eight models of FAV@BOC complexes were found to affirm the idea of such complex formation between the interacting substances. The models with O…Be, N…Be, and H…O interactions were found at higher strengths of adsorption in comparison with the models with F…Be interactions. Details of interactions indicated a level of physical adsorption for the FAV substance at the tip of the BOC substance with a dominant role of the BeO-decorated region for conducting the adsorption process. Additionally, molecular orbital features indicated significant changes from the singular to complex states, in which the models were able to be recognized based on measurements of such features.

The nonlinearity that these can provide has proven to be useful, in particular, for applications in quantum computation. Here we present a hybrid device that acts as a capacitor with a nonlinear charge-voltage relation. The device consists of a nanowire placed between the plates of a coplanar capacitor, with a co-parallel alignment. At low temperatures, due to the finite density of states on the nanowire, the charge distribution in the capacitor is uneven and energy-dependent, resulting in a charge-dependent effective capacitance. We study this system analytically and numerically, and show that the nonlinearity of the capacitance is significant enough to be utilized in circuit quantum electrodynamics. The resulting nonlinearity can be switched on, modulated, and switched off by an external potential, thus making this capacitive device highly versatile for uses in quantum computation. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd","nanowire; nonlinear capacitor; one dimensional electron gas; quantum capacitance effect; quantum technology; superconducting qubits","Capacitance; Electrodynamics; Electron gas; Qubits; Charge voltage; Electronics devices; Hybrid capacitance; Nonlinear capacitor; One dimensional electron gas; One-dimensional; Quantum capacitance effects; Quantum technologies; Superconducting qubits; Voltage profile; Nanowires","","","J.

We prepared two types of surface reconstruction, namely 2 × 1 and (√13 × √13)-R33.7° reconstructions, by annealing the SrTiO3(001) substrates in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and an oxygen environment, respectively. Subsequent co-depositions of Fe and Se atoms onto the 2 × 1 and (√13 × √13)-R33.7° reconstructed SrTiO3 surfaces lead to the growth of thin films of distinct six-fold and four-fold symmetry, respectively, under nominally the same growth conditions. Based on in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of the electronic structure, we ascribe the aforementioned two types of thin film to the reported hexagonal and tetragonal phases of FeSe, respectively. The observation of the growth of hexagonal FeSe on the tetragonal SrTiO3 surface with a 2 × 1 reconstruction is unexpected, the underlying mechanism of which remains an outstanding puzzle.

This piezotronic harmonic oscillator based on trapping wells not only provides a good understanding of quantum piezotronics but also a guide for developing peizotronic devices for quantum computing. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Harmonic oscillators; Nonuniform strain; Piezotronics; Qubit; Trapped ion","Computation theory; Electric fields; Harmonic analysis; Oscillators (electronic); Oscillators (mechanical); Quantum computers; Semiconductor devices; Harmonic oscillators; Non-uniform strain; Performance; Piezo-phototronic; Piezoelectric semiconductors; Piezopotential; Piezotronic; Quantum harmonic oscillators; Trapped charge; Trapped ion; Trapped ions","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52192610, 52192612); University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, UESTC, (ZYGX2021YGCX001)","The authors are thankful for the support from Major Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52192612 , 52192610 ).

In the last decade, concern has grown in analysing the impact of speculation forms in the extreme events that can occur in financial markets. The most important recent line of study is the development of the speculation scenarios and the possible incorporation of new ones, the strategy of traders and investors is one of the most important dimensions in the spontaneous generation of high risk in speculation that can suffer markets. Therefore, it becomes a necessary task to measure the amount and level of academic work that has been carried out on speculations and the different forms and trends that may have been throughout the years. Therefore, the main objective is to clarify the current state of speculation, carrying out a bibliometric analysis of the diverse topics. 2642 research papers published between 1971 and 2021 have been analyzed based on the Web of Science Core Collection (WoS) results, identifying publications and co-authorship among the most recognized authors, the countries with the highest percentage of scientific production, the most prominent citations, the most influential journals, and the co-occurrence of keywords. In summary, this study explores new lines of investigation through the measurement and observation of the academic articles until date, which objective is highlighting the new relevant speculation situations, such as the short squeeze in ‘meme stocks’, detection of short selling strategies using the High-Frequency trading, extreme volatility in cryptocurrencies and commodity price shocks. © 2023","Bibliometrics; Citations; Financial stability; Speculation; Web of science","","Universitat de Barcelona, UB, (UB-AE-AS017634)","This research was funded by the Universitat de Barcelona , under grant UB-AE-AS017634 .","D.

Room temperature (RT) single electron transistors (SETs) in silicon, defined using etched ∼10 nm point-contacts (PCs) and in-plane side gates, are investigated to enable fabrication fault detection. Devices are inspected using scanning electron microscopy, bright-field (BF) and DF imaging. Compared to BF, DF imaging enhances contrast from edge diffraction by ×3.5. Sub-wavelength features in the RT SET structure lead to diffraction peaks in the DF intensity patterns, creating signatures for device geometry. These features are investigated using a DF line scan optical simulation approximation of the experimental results. Dark field imaging and simulation are applied to three types of structures, comprising successfully-fabricated, over-etched and interconnected PC/gate devices.

The performance of the new GPU implementation as compared to OpenMP parallelization has been tested and checked on a couple of small sodium clusters and small covalent molecules. OpenMP parallelization allows a speed-up by one order of magnitude in average, as compared to a sequential computation. The use of a GPU permits a gain of an additional order of magnitude.

For this, we first elucidate the process of entanglement swapping in electron systems such as atoms, molecules or solid bodies. This demonstrates the significance of the number-parity superselection rule and highlights the relevance of localized few-orbital subsystems for quantum information processing tasks. Then, we explore and quantify the entanglement between localized orbitals in two systems, a tight-binding model of non-interacting electrons and the hydrogen ring. For this, we apply the first closed formula of a faithful entanglement measure, derived in (arXiv:2207.03377) as an extension of the von Neumann entropy to genuinely correlated many-orbital systems. For both systems, long-distance entanglement is found at low and high densities η, whereas for medium densities, η ≈ 1 2 , practically only neighboring orbitals are entangled. The Coulomb interaction does not change the entanglement pattern qualitatively except for low and high densities where the entanglement increases as function of the distance between both orbitals. © 2023 The Author(s).

The effective gate modulation of these quantum transport phenomena holds the promise of realizing a new computing architecture that differs from that of current Si electronics. In this article, we review the recent research progress on molecular transistors, specifically vertical molecular transistors (VMTs). First, we discuss the benefits of VMTs for future molecular-scale transistors compared with the currently dominant lateral molecular transistors. Subsequently, we describe representative examples of VMTs, where single molecules, self-assembled monolayers, and isolated molecules are used as transistor channels. Finally, we present our conclusions and perspectives about the use of VMTs for attractive quantum devices. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd","gating effect; molecular-scale transistors; quantum transport; vertical device structures","Computer architecture; Molecular orbitals; Molecules; Resonant tunneling; Gating effect; Molecular device; Molecular scale; Molecular transistors; Molecular-scale transistor; Quantum device; Quantum transport; Transport phenomenon; Vertical device structure; Vertical devices; Transistors","MANA; Research Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics; World Premier International Research Center Initiative; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (20K21010, 22H01532); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT; National Institute for Materials Science, NIMS","The authors appreciate the following financial supports by World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI), MEXT, Japan, Research Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics (MANA) of the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), Tsukuba, Japan, and JSPS Kakenhi grant numbers 20K21010 and 22H01532.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a dung beetle search algorithm (QHDBO) based on quantum computing and a multi-strategy hybrid. The good point set strategy is used to initialize the initial population of dung beetles. That makes the initial population more evenly distributed, and reduces the likelihood of the algorithm falling into a local optimum solution. The convergence factor and dynamic balance between the number of Spawning and foraging dung beetles is proposed. That allows the algorithm to focus on the global search in the early stages and local exploration in the later stages. The quantum computing based t-distribution variation strategy is used to variate the optimal global solution, that prevents the algorithm from falling into a local optimum. To verify the performance of the QHDBO algorithm, this paper compares QHDBO with six other swarm intelligence algorithms through 37 test functions and practical engineering application problems. The experimental results show that the improved dung beetle optimization algorithm significantly improves convergence speed and optimization accuracy and has good robustness. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Dung beetle optimization algorithm; Good point collection; Inertia factor; Quantum computing","Quantum computers; Dung beetle optimization algorithm; Dung beetles; Good point collection; Group intelligence; Inertia factor; Late stage; Local optima; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Quantum Computing; Optimization","Hebei Provincial Higher Education, (ZD2021403)","This research is supported by the fund of the Hebei Provincial Higher Education Scientific Research Project (Science and Technology Research Key Project ZD2021403 ).","G.

The first is the aggressive exploit process, which aims to increase the number of people seeking the best possible perspective to develop SNST performance. The second strategy proposes an adaptive parameter to aid in higher exploitation towards the end of iterations. This paper considers the multi-dimension OPF in EPGs with several minimization objectives for fuel costs, grid losses, and produced emissions. Not only that but also the system's power demands and losses must be satisfied. The performance of the proposed SNST and ESNST is evaluated on IEEE standard 30-bus, 57-bus, 118-bus, and practical West Delta Region EPGs.

Here we study the quantum entanglement in a lossy optomagnonical microcavity in the presence of photon and magnon Kerr nonlinearities. The system contains two optical modes of the cavity which couple to two ferromagnetic YIG spheres, with the losses of two optical fields and the magnonic modes. We then numerically obtain the entanglement between optical modes as photon–photon entanglement, magnonic modes as magnon–magnon entanglement, and one of the optical modes and the magnon modes as photon–magnon entanglement. Afterward, we examine the roles of photon–magnon coupling strength, dissipation, Kerr nonlinearities and thermal noise in the degree of entanglement between bipartite subsystems. The numerical results show that the increment of photon–magnon coupling and Kerr nonlinear susceptibility increase the maximum values of bipartite entanglements. Moreover, the maximum survival temperature of bipartite entanglements can appropriately be tuned by Kerr nonlinearity of magnon. Furthermore, the entanglement between subsystems can be observed at cryogenic temperatures. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Cavity optomagnonics; Dissipation; Entanglement; Kerr nonlinearity; Thermal effect","Optical Kerr effect; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Bipartite entanglement; Cavity optomagnonic; Cavity QED; Dissipation; Entanglement; Ferromagnetics; Kerr nonlinearity; Kerrnonlinearities; Optical modes; Quantum information science; Photons","","","H.R.

This interest is fueled by the improvements in hardware, software, and algorithms needed for its practical application and the promise that it holds for the future acceleration of computational workloads compared to classical computing. Due to its true quantum nature, the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm is one of many methods that has garnered much attention lately. Simulating it requires much memory and is unsolvable on systems with average system sizes. Another algorithm known as Kitaev's algorithm or iterative quantum phase estimation algorithm (IQPE) functions with a single control qubit, which is its primary benefit over QPE. Recently another approximate IQPE (AIPE) approach was proposed in Shokri et al. (2021) for faster calculations than traditional IQPE. In order to evaluate the energy eigenvalues of several quantum mechanical systems, such as the finite square well potential (SWP) and harmonic oscillator(HO), by solving the Schrödinger equations, we developed both the traditional IQPE and AIPE techniques in this study using our own Python programs on IBM Qiskit. Our simulations of the systems with a fair inaccuracies relative to the actual values are supported by our findings from running the quantum circuits. Interestingly we found for SWP, AIPE performs better, whereas for the HO, traditional IQPE performs better than the AIPE approach.

Verifier local revocation (VLR) is an important method to revoke a misbehaving user in group signature, which has attracted many researchers’ attention. However, the existing lattice-based group signature schemes with VLR either achieve only selfless anonymity, have revocation list of size linear with the number of revoked users, or suffer from the issue that signatures generated by revoked users could easily be linked by an adversary. Additionally, the development of quantum computing technology threatens the security of traditional cryptosystems. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new lattice-based group signature scheme, which makes use of the complete tree technique to combine the timestamp with VLR. It enjoys post-quantum security and satisfies almost full anonymity and traceability if the LWE and SIS problems are hard. Compared with previous schemes, our scheme achieves backward unlinkability additionally. Thanks to the revocation token update mechanism, a revocation token for time period t could not be connected with signatures generated in period t+1. Furthermore, the revocation list in our scheme only stores the tokens of users who have been revoked before the expiry, reducing the revocation list size effectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Backward unlinkability; Group signature; Lattice; Post-quantum security; Verifier local revocation","Network security; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Backward unlinkability; Computing technology; Group signature scheme; Group signatures; Lattice; Lattice-based; Post quantum; Post-quantum securities; Quantum Computing; Verifier-local revocations; Authentication","Major Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Research; Major Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Research, China, (2019B030302008); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62272174); Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Program key projects, (201902010081)","Funding text 1: The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Qiong Huang reports financial support was provided by Major Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Research (No. 2019B030302008), National Natural Science Foundation of China (62272174), and Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou (201902010081).This work is supported by the Major Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Research, China (2019B030302008), National Natural Science Foundation of China (62272174), and Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China (201902010081).; Funding text 2: This work is supported by the Major Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Research, China ( 2019B030302008 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 62272174 ), and Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China ( 201902010081 ).

To unlock the potential benefits of QC, quantum software development (QSD) enables harnessing its power, further driving innovation across diverse domains. To ensure successful QSD projects, it is crucial to concentrate on key variables. Objective: This study aims to identify key variables in QSD and develop a model for predicting the success probability of QSD projects. Methodology: We identified key QSD variables from existing literature to achieve these objectives and collected expert insights using a survey instrument. We then analyzed these variables using an optimization model, i.e., Genetic Algorithm (GA), with two different prediction methods the Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Logistic Regression (LR). Results: The results of success probability prediction models indicate that as the QSD process matures, project success probability significantly increases, and costs are notably reduced. Furthermore, the best fitness rankings for each QSD project variable determined using NBC and LR indicated a strong positive correlation (rs=0.945). The t-test results (t = 0.851, p = 0.402>0.05) show no significant differences between the rankings calculated by the two methods (NBC and LR). Conclusion: The results reveal that the developed success probability prediction model, based on 14 identified QSD project variables, highlights the areas where practitioners need to focus more in order to facilitate the cost-effective and successful implementation of QSD projects. © 2023 The Author(s)","Genetic algorithm; Prediction model; Quantum computing (QC); Quantum software development (QSD); Variables","Barium compounds; Cost effectiveness; Forecasting; Genetic programming; Logistic regression; Quantum computers; Software design; Key variables; Logistics regressions; Model-based OPC; Naive Bayes classifiers; Prediction modelling; Quantum Computing; Quantum software development; Software development projects; Variable; Genetic algorithms","","","M.A. Akbar; Software Engineering Department, Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology, Lappeenranta, 53851, Finland; email: azeem.akbar@lut.fi","","Elsevier B.V.","09505849","","ISOTE","","English","Inf Software Technol","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175262059"

For the purpose of deep space applications explorations, comprehensive study of the effects of particle irradiation on the lattice stability and electronic properties of ε-Ga2O3 are of pivotal importance. In this work, leveraging a unique Ta radiation source, we interrogate the radiation hardness of ε-Ga2O3 thin films after 1907 MeV Ta swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation. Detailed characterizations of the structural and optical properties show that the morphology and lattice structure are disrupted, with an increase of the band gap. Additionally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments combining density functional theory calculations corroborate extrinsic flux-induced high concentration defects in the film, which lead to truncated photo-response performance of the device. However, even upon irradiation with a fluence of 5 × 1010 cm−2, the overall performance of the device remains robust and substantial. This outstanding radiation hardness of ε-Ga2O3 thin films rationalizes their potential usage for space applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Band structure; Defect dynamics; Optoelectrical characteristics; Radiation hardness; Swift heavy ion irradiation; ε-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>","Defects; Density functional theory; Electronic properties; Energy gap; Hardness; Heavy ions; Ion bombardment; Morphology; Optical lattices; Optical properties; Photodetectors; Photons; Space applications; Thin films; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Defect dynamics; Heavy ions irradiations; Optoelectrical; Optoelectrical characteristic; Performance; Radiation hardness; Swift heavy ion irradiation; Swift heavy ions; Thin-films; Ε-ga2O3; Gallium compounds","Texas Sea Grant, Texas A and M University, TSG, (6000772); City University of Hong Kong, CityU; Aromatic Plant Research Center, APRC, (9610500); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12074044, 62204019); Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, BUPT, (2023ZCJH1); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, YIPA CAS; State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, SKLIPOC, (IPOC2021ZT05, IPOC2021ZT10); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFB4401700); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 12074044 , 62204019 ), the Fund of State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications (IPOC2021ZT05, IPOC2021ZT10), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (BUPT, 2023ZCJH1), the Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS, and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2022YFB4401700).

We determine that the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector acting between the second nearest neighbor sites of the intralayer is non-zero and large in MX3, owing to the breaking of the local inversion symmetry. Large DMIs cause nanoscale magnetic vortices, i.e. that is, skyrmions. We observe both conventional skyrmions in CrCl3 and VCl3 and antiferromagnetic skyrmions in FeCl3 and merons in MnCl3.

One solution for such an issue is to use quantum-inspired to which refers to a technology, an algorithm, or a strategy that uses conventional computers to execute quantum physics concepts. These techniques make an effort to imitate particular quantum computing properties, such as superposition, entanglement, or quantum parallelism, in order to more effectively or creatively handle particular issues. It can provide security against all types of intruders. Objectives: In this article, inspired by Quantum Key Distribution, we proposed a key-management protocol for enhancing the security and reliability of the network. Two major objectives have been taken into consideration during the proposal of QLSN (proposed protocol), (i) reduced risk if the network needs to transfer the long keys and (ii) a reliable network to transmit the information safely. Methods: (i) QLSN is proposed in the place of the classical Diffie–Hellman key exchange algorithm, which makes it secure against attacks during the transmission of data through the IPSec tunnel. (ii) Risk Analysis is performed on 1-bit, 2 bits, 15 bits, and 50 bits sizes of data. Data transmission is tested for risk analysis and the probability of attacks is checked under different scenarios. Results: The simulation results illustrated the better performance of the proposed protocol in different scenarios with large-scale networks compared to the existing Diffie–Hellman key exchange used in the IPSec protocol proposed by CISCO. Using quantum algorithms and processing advantages, quantum adversaries may be able to take advantage of weaknesses in conventional security systems. Conclusion: An essential step in determining and validating the viability of proposed protocol inside a quantum computing framework is the integration of a QLSN protocol into the IBM Qiskit simulator. By addressing pressing concerns, this validation approach clarifies the performance and security consequences of large-scale networks. Looking ahead, the fusion of artificial intelligence and quantum computing promises fresh methods for key management that will improve network security. In addition, Turing machines–classical computing tools that bridge the gap between the classical and quantum computing paradigms–will continue to play crucial roles in the complex world of large-scale networks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Large scale networks; Qiskit; QKD; Quantum computing; Security","Data transfer; Internet protocols; Network security; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Classical computing; Diffie-Hellman key exchange; Key-management; Large-scale network; Limited information; Performance; Qiskit; QKD; Quantum Computing; Security; Risk assessment","","","S.

This contains a single-mode radiation field which interacts with two two-level atoms and a mechanical resonator, in the presence of different sources of dissipation, i.e., cavity loss and atomic spontaneous emission. Moreover, an external pump field is also driven into the cavity. Obtaining the effective Hamiltonian of the whole system along with using the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, we find the state vector of the system, numerically. We then investigate the dynamics of bipartite entanglements between the two atoms as well as photon–phonon subsystems by means of concurrence, and also the temporal behavior of population inversion of the two atoms. In each case, the influences of atom-field coupling strength, optical–mechanical mode coupling, amplitude of pump field, and also different sources of dissipation in the above-mentioned quantum properties are investigated. The obtained results show that the photon–phonon entanglement can be protected and enhanced by adjusting the system parameters. Moreover, the degree of entanglement between photon and phonon can significantly be improved by the increase of the amplitude of external driven field. Furthermore, the effect of atom-field coupling on the amount of atom–atom entanglement is remarkable. In addition, the high values of atomic population inversion can be observed in the presence of atomic decay. Also, the phenomena of the typical collapse-revival phenomenon in the population inversion may be observed, via justifying the involved parameters. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Atom–atom entanglement; Dissipation; Optomechanical system; Photon–phonon entanglement","Atoms; Hamiltonians; Phonons; Quantum entanglement; Atom-atom entanglement; Atomic inversion; Atomic population inversion; Dissipation; Field coupling; Micro-macro; Opto-mechanical systems; Photon–phonon entanglement; Population inversions; Pump fields; Photons","","","M.K.

At the same time, the advent of the quantum computing era has brought unprecedented challenges to traditional cryptography. Fortunately, a lattice-based PKEET scheme can solve the above problems. In this paper, we design a lattice-based PKE-DET scheme that can support the delegated tester function with satisfying anti-quantum computing security and resisting OMRA attacks.

Despite this large interest, there exist very few proposals for relevant physical platforms to evaluate quantum kernels. In this article, we propose and simulate a protocol capable of evaluating quantum kernels using Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, an experimental technique that is widely accessible to optics researchers. Our proposal utilises the orthogonal temporal modes of a single photon, allowing one to encode multi-dimensional feature vectors. As a result, interfering two photons and using the detected coincidence counts, we can perform a direct measurement and binary classification. This physical platform confers an exponential quantum advantage also described theoretically in other works. We present a complete description of this method and perform a numerical experiment to demonstrate a sample application for binary classification of classical data. © 2023 The Author(s).

Phonons influence both correlations and tunneling and additionally they shift the energies of the dots. Depending on the dot energies and the strength of electron–phonon coupling, the system is occupied by a different number of electrons that effectively interact with each other repulsively or attractively leading to a number of different ground states of DQD.

The s-SNOM works by exposing an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip to an optical electromagnetic (EM) field, while the tip is so close to a dielectric sample that the incident beam lies within the near-field regime and displays nonlinear behavior. We suggest replacing the incident EM field by photons generated by a single photon emitter, and propose a theoretical model for the suggested system by employing electric-dipole approximation, image theory, and perturbation theory. The count rate of the scattered photons from the AFM tip is extracted through a single photon detector, which contains information about electrical permittivity of the dielectric material beneath the tip. The permittivity of the sample can be extracted through spectroscopic setups.

However, the interplay between high nitrogen and low phosphorus conditions is not fully understood. Nitrogen metabolism is critical for the metabolism of cyanobacteria. Transcriptomic analysis in the present study suggested that nitrogen metabolism and ribosome biogenesis were the two most significantly changed pathways in long-term phosphorus-starved bloom-forming cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa FACHB-905. Notably, the primary glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase cycle, crucial for nitrogen metabolism, was significantly downregulated. Concurrently, nitrogen uptake showed a marked decrease due to reduced expression of nitrogen source transporters. The content of intracellular nitrogen reservoir phycocyanin also showed a drastic decrease upon phosphorus starvation. Our study demonstrated that long-term phosphorus-starved cells also suffered from nitrogen deficiency because of the reduction in nitrogen assimilation, which might be limited by the reduced ribosome biogenesis and the shortage of adenosine triphosphate.

We find that the system can operate in a stationary regime and exhibits non-Gaussian quantum correlations. Bipartite and tripartite quantum correlations can be established between the end wells of the system which can be measured either in situ or in the outcoupled beams. Symmetric EPR steering can be achieved between the end wells at steady state. While in some cases, there exists asymmetric EPR steering between the middle well and one of the end wells during the transients, although it tends to be symmetric at steady state. The results show that quantum correlations depend deeply on the choice of collisional nonlinearity and the intensity of pumping. Different from the optical cavity, where dissipation is inevitable, our scheme allows for selective addition of pumping and damping. This feature makes it a flexible and controllable resource for experimental investigations and future technological applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Bose–Hubbard model; continuous variable entanglement; EPR steering; Non-Gaussian","Damping; Gaussian distribution; Hubbard model; Pumps; Bose Hubbard model; Continuous variable entanglement; Continuous variables; EPR steering; Gaussian quantum; Hubbard systems; Non-Gaussian; Quantum correlations; Steady state; Symmetrics; Gaussian noise (electronic)","Key Project of Hubei Province Education Department, (D20221704); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11704287)","We thank M.

With the scale increase of PPICs, the accumulation of manufacturing errors will lead to overall performance deviations. A symmetrical Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) circuit with a shorter optical path and lower propagation loss has been proposed recently to replace the traditional asymmetrical MZI circuit. However, no systematic research on the error compensation of symmetrical MZI circuits has been reported yet. In this paper, the error tolerance characteristics of symmetrical MZI circuits and asymmetrical MZI circuits are analyzed and compared in detail. An effective strategy to compensate the 3 dB beam splitter error of a symmetrical MZI circuit is proposed. A deep learning task of the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) handwritten digit dataset classification was carried out with two hidden layers, which are implemented by rectangular symmetrical MZI circuit structures. The recognition accuracy can be significantly improved with this error compensation method. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network; Manufacturing errors; MNIST handwritten digit classification; Programmable photonic integrated circuit","Character recognition; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Electric network analysis; Error compensation; Linear transformations; Neural networks; Optical data processing; Photonic crystals; Photonic devices; Photonic integration technology; Signal processing; Errors tolerance; Handwritten digit classification; Linear optical; Manufacturing errors; Modified national institute of standard and technology handwritten digit classification; Multi-port; National Institute of Standards and Technology; Photonics Integrated Circuits; Programmable photonic integrated circuit; Programmable photonics; Timing circuits","","","J.

More specifically, given two string s,s′∈{0,1}n satisfying the above constraints, for any x∈{0,1}n the max inner product oracle Omax(x) returns the max value between s⋅x and s′⋅x, and the sub-set oracle Osub(x) indicates whether the index set of the 1s in x is a subset of that in s or s′. We present an exact quantum algorithm consuming O(1) queries to the max inner product oracle for identifying the pair {s,s′}, and prove that any randomized algorithm requires Ω(n/log2⁡n) queries. Also, we present a quantum algorithm consuming [Formula presented]+O(n) queries to the subset oracle, and prove that any randomized algorithm requires at least n−3+Ω(log2⁡n) queries. Therefore, quantum speedups are revealed in the two oracle models.

In the actual transmission process, the scattering system in the imaging path can affect the imaging quality of the CGI. The half-cyclic sinusoidal-pattern based CGI (HCSP-CGI) can recover the scene images at low sampling rates (SRs). Based on the Monte Carlo (MC) model, we propose and construct a reflective polarization system based the HCSP-CGI in fog environment and put forward a method that combines polarization information with the HCSP-CGI called the PHCSP-CGI. When the difference in reflectivity between target and background is small, the difference in polarization characteristics between target and background can help CGI to remove the interference of stray light. The imaging performance of the PHCSP-CGI at different SRs and scattering distances (SDs) are analyzed.

Our proof of PRF-completeness is simpler and fixes some errors in the original proof, while also introducing a new reversible iteration scheme for RPP. By keeping the formalization and semi-automatic proofs simple, we are able to identify a single programming pattern that can generate a set of reversible algorithms within RPP: Cantor pairing, integer division quotient/remainder, and truncated square root.

Our main goal is to achieve the most significant possible degree of pore filling and to study the effect of encapsulation of complex Cu(en)(H2O)2SO4 in SBA-15 silica on the magnetic properties of the studied complex by means of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and magnetization measurements. It was found that the adsorption equilibrium during the adsorption of the Cu(en)(H2O)2SO4 complex from the solution to SBA-15 was reached after only 24 h, and the samples prepared by adsorption for a longer time (72 h, 14 days) did not show an increased amount of the loaded complex. The degree of pore filling represents around 60 % of the total volume of internal pores.

To address it, comprehensive investigation is performed to decipher atomic structure and compositional features of the Josephson junction which basically consists of an Al/AlOx/Al tri-layer materials system. It is revealed that the top-Al and the bottom-Al layers are with the thickness of 25.8 ± 0.8 nm and 20.4 ± 1.4 nm, respectively, slightly smaller than the intended thickness of 30 nm, which may be due to the inherent error associated to the measuring method based on cross sectional transmission electron microscopy micrographs. In addition, both the top and bottom crystalline Al layers comprise columnar grains with the size of approximately 20 × 30 nm. The AlOx tunnel layer is roughly 2∼4 nm thick and is composed of amorphous materials. The interfaces between AlOx and Al electrodes are jagged rather than flat, implying thickness inhomogeneity which can be possibly ascribed to the mechanisms of atomic steps and grain boundary grooving. Moreover, EELS spectrum imaging reveals a 0.5 nm-thick interfacial layer at boundary of AlOx barrier and Al electrodes. Unique ELNES features at the interfacial layer, including a −2 eV onset-shift of the O-K edge, are correlated with reduction of electronic properties of the barrier layer. Atom probe tomography reveals that composition of the bottom-Al/Si substrate interface primarily comprises AlO, O, C, Al2O, SiO, SiO2, P, O2 and Al2O2 and small quantities of SiC2, B and AlO2. Furthermore, significant strain, e.g., ∼3% normal and shear strain, can be detected in the bottom-Al layer grains, which probably stems from the uneven Si surface during the qubit fabrication process. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Atomic structure; Composition; EELS; Josephson junction; Strain","Alumina; Aluminum; Amorphous silicon; Atoms; Crystal atomic structure; Crystal lattices; Electrodes; Electronic properties; Grain boundaries; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Nanowires; Quantum optics; Qubits; Scanning tunneling microscopy; Shear strain; Silica; Al electrode; Atomic structure; Chemical compositions; Chemical information; Compositional features; Interfacial layer; Josephson-junction; Quantum computing devices; Structure features; Trilayers; Aluminum oxide","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Basic Energy Sciences, BES, (DE-AC02-05CH11231); China Association for Science and Technology, CAST, (YESS20210054); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, (ZRMS2022000863)","This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231, the Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by China Association for Science and Technology (No. YESS20210054) and the Hubei Province Natural Science Foundation (ZRMS2022000863).","X.

Objective collapse models propose a dynamical explanation for this phenomenon, by making a stochastic non-unitary and norm-preserving modification to the Schrödinger equation. In the present article we ask how a quantum system evolves under a deterministic and non-unitary but norm-preserving evolution? We show using a simple two-qubit model that under suitable conditions, quantum linear superposition is broken, with the system predictably driven to one or the other eigenstates. If this deterministic dynamics is coarse-grained and observed over a lower time resolution, the outcomes appear random while obeying the Born probability rule. Our analysis hence throws light on the distinct roles of non-unitarity and of stochasticity in objective collapse models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Measurement problem; Octonions; Quantum foundations; Quantum gravity; Spontaneous collapse models; Time of arrival; Trace dynamics","Dynamics; Gravitation; Quantum optics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Time of arrival; Coarse-grained; Deterministics; Measurement problems; Octonion; Quantum foundations; Quantum gravity; Spontaneous collapse model; Time-of- arrivals; Times of arrivals; Trace dynamic; Wave functions","Blaumann Foundation","KK thanks the Blaumann Foundation for supporting this work.","K.

This work reports innovative Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) growth methodology on 4 in. Si substrates which allowed the growth of 230 mm thick layer of (111) 3C-SiC through the melting of the Si substrate in the CVD chamber and the adoption of the resulting free standing 3C-SiC for the growth of bulk (111) 3C-SiC layer under high N fluxes. From the molten KOH etching and subsequent SEM investigation it has been ascertained that with a N2 flux of 1600 sccm there is a significant reduction in the concentration of stacking faults (SFs) from (7.16 ± 0.04) × 103 cm−1 to (0.4 ± 0.3) × 103 cm−1. This reduction is consistent with the cross section m-PL response displaying steep and uniform increase in the intensity of the band-edge signal a factor 10 higher on the surface with respect to the equal (100) 3C-SiC grown thickness. Furthermore, the emission attributed to point defects is considerably lower in (111) 3C-SiC. From Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) investigation it appears evident how the typical mechanism valid in (100) growths consisting in the mutual closure of SFs coming from opposing {111} planes that give rise to Lomer and l-shaped dislocations is replaced by a different panorama of evolution. Indeed, it is shown how the SFs shred but do not interrupt each other during growth. Furthermore, dropping in the number of atomic planes composing SFs layers appears to be a key phenomenon leading to both the shrinkage of the number of SF atomic layers as well as to the SF self-closure. High Angle Annular Dark Field-Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HAADF-STEM) attested how the crystal tends to smooth out the lattice mismatch until the SF is suppressed. Because of the foregoing, the mechanisms of evolution of the defects in (111) 3C-SiC revealed in this study, demonstrates how the growth parameters must be matched with the kinetics of the defects in order to endorse (111) 3C-SiC adoption in high performing devices. © 2023 The Authors","(111) 3C-SiC; CVD growth; Photoluminescence; Stacking faults; TEM","Chemical vapor deposition; Etching; Growth kinetics; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Lattice mismatch; Point defects; Potassium hydroxide; Scanning electron microscopy; Silicon carbide; Silicon wafers; Substrates; % reductions; (111) 3c-SiC; 3C-SiC films; Bulk growth; Chemical vapor deposition growth; Chemical vapour deposition; Crystal qualities; Si substrates; TEM; Thick layers; Stacking faults","NextGeneration EU, (ECS00000022); European Commission, EC, (720827, 863220); Horizon 2020, (823717 – ESTEEM3)","Funding text 1: This work has been partially funded by European Union (NextGeneration EU), through the MUR-PNRR project SAMOTHRACE ( ECS00000022 ). ; Funding text 2: This research was partially funded by the European Union within the framework of the project CHALLENGE, grant number 720827 , and SiC nano for PicoGeo, grant agreement number 863220 .; Funding text 3: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agresteeeement No 823717 – ESTEEM3.

This chapter focuses on the properties of FND. The quantum sensing capabilities of FNDs are related to the magnetic states of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centers inside FND particles. The photoluminescent characteristics of FNDs are attributed to color centers, also known as local defects, present in ND crystals. These color centers act similarly to individual atoms or molecules within the solid host of the NDs. For cell biologists, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors are important tools for gathering information about fluorescent proteins, interactions between proteins, and the conformational biology of components such as reporters. The FND can act as a permanent FRET donor, comparable with an organic dye or fluorescent protein, but without the low photostability or photoblinking that characterizes these other alternatives. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

By measuring the temperature dependence of resistivity of (TiNbMoTaW)Nx nitrides, we observe a significant increase of TC, from 0.62 K for x = 0 up to 5.02 K for x = 0.74. With further increase of x, TC is decreasing and reaches 1.08 K for x = 0.97. The eightfold TC enhancement seems to be associated with the incorporation of light N atoms into the face-centered cubic lattice and with the x dependent enhancement of the electron-phonon interaction, which may be related to the high configuration entropy in high entropy alloys. Measurements in magnetic field show that the upper critical fields Bc2 of (TiNbMoTaW)Nx with x > 0.15 provide Bc2/TC > 2 T/K ratios, which are above the weak-coupling pair breaking limit. Additional heat capacity and point contact spectroscopy measurements show that the superconductivity in the ∼1 μm thick films is bulk in nature, consistent with conventional weak-coupling phonon mediated superconductivity. The proposed strategy of nitrogen incorporation into high entropy alloys may pave a pathway towards tailoring their superconducting properties, especially their TC. © 2023","High entropy alloy nitrides; Superconductivity; Transition temperature; Upper critical field","Electron-phonon interactions; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Magnetron sputtering; Metallic films; Nitrides; Point contacts; Specific heat; Temperature distribution; Thick films; Alloy film; High entropy alloy nitride; High entropy alloys; High power; Multiple transitions; N incorporation; Nitrogen incorporation; Upper critical fields; Uppercritical fields; Weak couplings; Superconducting transition temperature","U.S. Steel Košice; Slovenská Akadémia Vied, SAV, (AT-SK 2023-03-15-003); Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG, (871687); Agentúra na Podporu Výskumu a Vývoja, APVV, (2/0058/20, APVV-18-0358, VEGA 2/0032/20)","We wish to acknowledge the support by projects Mobility Slovakia-Austria (Slovak Academy of Sciences) , AT-SK 2023-03-15-003 , Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contract no.

This could be due to competition of diffusion of trapped nitrogen from interstitial positions followed by desorption and recombination of the implanted nitrogen with carbon vacancies, resulting in very thermally stable nitrogen species. The latter process is dominant at ∼700 °C where the onset of vacancies diffusion in diamond occurs. For D2, an additional component associated with C[tbnd]N(nitrile-like) bonds is observed. From vibrational spectroscopy, the H-Diamond surface implanted with a D1 dose displays features associated with nitrogen bonding to carbon atoms and hydrogen bonding to the diamond surface and defects. Unlike the MW(N2) plasma case, no NHx(ads) bonds are identified upon implantation. High-temperature annealing shows that for the D1 dose, partial surface structural recovery occurs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Diamond; Low-energy N<sub>2</sub> <sup>+</sup> ion implantation; Surface modification; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Diamonds; Hydrogen bonds; Ion implantation; Nitrogen; Thermodynamic stability; Annealing temperatures; Diamond surfaces; Ions implantation; Line intensities; Low energy nitrogen; Low-energy N2 + ion implantation; Lower energies; N species; Surface-modification; Symmetrics; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Helen Diller Quantum Center; Technion-IIT; Israel Science Foundation, ISF, (557/23); Technion-Israel Institute of Technology","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Technion-IIT for the promotion of research.

Reducing surface dielectric loss is crucial for achieving a high quality factor and a long relaxation time (T 1), which can be engineered by carefully changing the geometry of a transmon. In this paper, we present a shape-optimization approach to reduce surface dielectric loss in a transmon qubit. The capacitor pads and junction wires of transmons are shaped as spline curves and optimized through the finite-element method and a global optimization algorithm. We find that the participation ratio of capacitor pads and junction wires can be reduced by 15 % − 18 % and 22 % − 26 % compared to previous designs, while the overall footprint and anharmonicity are maintained at acceptable values. As a result, the two-level system-limited quality factor and the corresponding T 1 were increased by 21.6%. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","shape optimization; superconducting qubits; surface dielectric loss; transmon","Curve fitting; Dielectric devices; Global optimization; Shape optimization; Decoherence; Global optimization algorithm; High quality factors; Optimization approach; Shape-optimization; Spline curve; Superconducting qubits; Surface dielectric loss; Transmon; Transmon qubit; Dielectric losses","Applied Superconductivity Center; Electric Power Research Institute of Seoul National University; Samsung; Seoul National University, SNU; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2022M3I9A1072846); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This research was supported by the 2022 Student-Directed Education Regular Program from Seoul National University and the National R&D Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (2022M3I9A1072846) and in part by the Applied Superconductivity Center, Electric Power Research Institute of Seoul National University.

It was originally developed to enhance software security during the design phase but has since been adapted for Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). ICSs are complex and interconnected systems that control critical infrastructure, such as power plants, water treatment facilities, and manufacturing plants. As such, they are major targets for cyberattacks, which may lead to human casualties, severe national security impacts, and financial instability. This systematic literature review explores the existing threat modeling methodologies for ICSs and emphasizes the importance of employing methodical frameworks that cover safety, security, and privacy aspects with clear procedural guidelines. The review reveals that ICSs threat modeling often lacks validation to ensure that the used methodologies are effective in identifying and mitigating threats. This study emphasizes the need to develop and apply better validation metrics in case studies. The main goal of this review is to help cyber security researchers and practitioners in selecting a suitable threat modeling approach that facilitates the creation of ICSs with an acceptable level of security. © 2023 The Author(s)","Cyber-physical system (CPS); Industrial control system (ICS); Risk assessment; Security analysis; Security-by-design; Systematic literature review (SLR); Threat modeling (TM)","Control systems; Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Embedded systems; Intelligent control; National security; Risk analysis; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Cybe-physical system; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Industrial control system; Industrial control systems; Risks assessments; Security analysis; Security-by-design; Systematic literature review; Threat modeling; Risk assessment","Haridus- ja Teadusministeerium, HM; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (2014-2020.4.01.20-0289)","This work has been supported by the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research and the European Regional Development Fund (grant 2014-2020.4.01.20-0289 ).

This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in remote sea and oceanic waters, at large distances from the coastline. Forty-three 500-liter samples were collected between May 2022 and January 2023 from the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Arctic region, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. Using molecular detection methods including real-time RT-qPCR and nested PCR followed by sequencing, we successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 7 of the 43 marine water samples (16.3 %), and specifically in samples taken from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The estimated concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies in the positive samples ranged from 6 to 470 per 100 l. The presence of mutations characteristic of the Omicron variant was identified in these samples by amplicon sequencing. These findings provide evidence of the unforeseen presence of SARS-CoV-2 in marine waters even at distances of miles from the coastline and in open ocean waters. It is important to consider that these findings only display the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and further investigations are required to assess if infectious virus can be present in the marine environment. © 2023","Marine water samples; Molecular detection methods; Oceanic waters; SARS-CoV-2 detection; Sea Care project","Arabian Sea; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Indian Ocean; Mediterranean Sea; Persian Gulf; Red Sea [Indian Ocean]; Diseases; Landforms; Oceanography; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; sea water; virus RNA; Atlantic Ocean; Detection methods; Marine water sample; Marine waters; Molecular detection; Molecular detection method; Oceanic waters; SARS-CoV-2 detection; Sea care project; Water samples; coastal zone; COVID-19; detection method; molecular analysis; polymerase chain reaction; real time; seawater; severe acute respiratory syndrome; wastewater; water footprint; amplicon; Arctic; Article; Atlantic Ocean; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental factor; geographic distribution; health hazard; Italy; knowledge gap; marine environment; Mediterranean Sea; national health organization; nested polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Persian Gulf; real time polymerase chain reaction; Red Sea; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; sea; Sea Care project; seashore; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; virus mutation; water sampling; Coronavirus","Amerigo Vespucci's World Tour Campaign; Department of Chemistry University of Rome; EP&OHS General Office of Navy General Staff; Italian National Health Institute; Italian Navy; Italian Navy and her Chief of Staff; National Center for Water Safety; National Recovery and Resilience Plan; Navy's Health Inspectorate; Sea Care; National Institutes of Health, NIH; Kansas Department of Health and Environment, KDHE; European Commission, EC; Università degli Studi di Padova, UNIPD; Istituto Superiore di Sanità, ISS","Very special thanks go to Prof. Silvio BRUSAFERRO, President of the Italian National Health Institute, and to the Italian Navy and her Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Enrico Credendino, as Heads of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Italian Navy and the ISS.

This paper attempts to build a novel berth-tugboat-quay crane joint scheduling method for container ports to reduce the economic cost of container ports. Firstly, from the perspective of the economic cost of container ports, considering random economic factors, this paper proposes a new berth-tugboat-quay crane joint dispatch optimization model, namely E-BUQC, by taking the minimum time cost of vessels in port, the cost of additional freight distance for trucks, the cost of tugboat operation, and the minimum operation cost of quay cranes as the objective function. Then, in order to obtain a relatively high-quality solution, based on chaotic mapping and quantum computing, this paper constructs a new chaotic quantum adaptive satin bower bird optimizer algorithm, namely CQASBO, formulates exclusive coding rules for the E-BUQC model, develops a feasible integer algorithm, and proposes a new joint scheduling solution method of berth-tugboat-quay crane, named E-BUQC_CQASBO. Subsequently, based on the simulation examples of two ports in northern China, the new solution method is tested. The simulation test results show that the E-BUQC model obtains an appropriate solution; The CQASBO constructed in this paper has better performance than other traditional comparison algorithms selected in this paper and can provide a better solution when solving the E-BUQC model. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Berth-tugboat-quay crane joint scheduling; Chaotic mapping; Optimization model; Quantum computing; Random economic factors; SBO","Birds; Containers; Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric load dispatching; Integer programming; Mapping; Quantum computers; Berth-tugboat-quay crane joint scheduling; Chaotic mapping; Container ports; Economic factors; Joint scheduling; Optimization models; Quantum Computing; Quay cranes; Random economic factor; SBO; Tugboats","Heilongjiang Social Science Fund, (20JYB042); Scientific and Technical Program of China National Offshore Oil Corporation, (LSZX-2020-HN-05-04); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (110-2410-H- 161-001); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFB1504403); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (21BGL064)","This work was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (21BGL064); Heilongjiang Social Science Fund (20JYB042); The Scientific and Technical Program of China National Offshore Oil Corporation under contract No. LSZX-2020-HN-05-04;National Key Research and Development Program of China (2019YFB1504403); and Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 110-2410-H- 161-001).","W.-C.

Since, obtaining a large-scale labelled dataset for mental health conditions is a big challenge; the self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks are more suitable for developing such systems. This paper presents a novel Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Contrastive Learning framework for continuous mental health monitoring by leveraging LSTM's strengths in time series data analytics aiding it with the benefits of quantum computation, contrastive learning, and transfer learning. In the pretext task of the contrastive learning framework, a quantum guided LSTM base-encoder is developed for effective representational learning. The learnt model is then fine-tuned by training it with a small labelled dataset to further enhance its prediction capability. Experiments were carried out on seven benchmark datasets related to mental health conditions. With the enhanced representational and prediction abilities, the proposed model has shown superior performance over traditional ones. On heart rate variability dataset collected from (Schmidt et al., 2018), it achieves the greatest F1-score of 0.99. The paired t-test at 95% confidence level demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms the other related models. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Contrastive learning; Deep learning; Mental health monitoring; Quantum computing; Quantum self-supervised learning; Self-supervised learning","Data Analytics; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum computers; Contrastive learning; Deep learning; Health monitoring; Labeled dataset; Learning frameworks; Mental health; Mental health monitoring; Quantum Computing; Quantum self-supervised learning; Self-supervised learning; Long short-term memory","","","A.

NDs can be sorted by size into nanocrystalline or ultrananocrystalline. These substances have existed for millions of years and can be found in the earth's sediment layers, in extraterrestrial materials, and in natural petroleum. High-pressure high-temperature NDs consist of substitutional nitrogen impurities, which lead to highly fluorescent nitrogen-vacancy centers upon appropriate treatment. As a result, they have been found to be particularly useful biomarkers. Historically, the first reported NDs to be used were detonation.

In this paper, based on the quantum variational algorithm, we propose a novel scheme to train an Ansatz circuit and realize high-fidelity compilation of a set of universal quantum gates for singlet-triplet qubits in semiconductor double quantum dots, a fairly heavily constrained system. Furthermore, we propose a scalable architecture for a modular implementation of quantum programs in this constrained systems and validate its performance with two representative demonstrations, the Grover’s algorithm for the database searching (static compilation) and a variant of variational quantum eigensolver for the Max-Cut optimization (dynamic compilation).

But the issue of exponential computational complexity limits its real-time application. Since quantum computers with its natural parallel computing capability can theoretically achieve speedup, an HHL-based algorithm for implementing DST operations on quantum circuits has been proposed. However, the algorithm is impossible to be implemented with high accuracy due to the limited performance of quantum computers in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In response to that, we utilize an up-to-date scheme Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) to conduct DST operations by solving the linear system. Besides, VQLS further reveals the structural consistency of DST with quantum computation, which enables faster circuit configuration and computation. In this paper, we first realize the transformation in belief functions by VQLS and then extends it to a methods of implementing combination rules. Simulated under a realistic classification task, the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed VQLS-based method are verified. The new VQLS-based method proposed is able to achieve combination rules at a lower error level with fewer quantum resources, which is more suitable for the NISQ era. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Belief matrices; Dempster–Shafer Theory; Information fusion; Variational Quantum Algorithm; Variational Quantum Linear Solver","Decision making; Decision theory; Linear systems; Quantum computers; Uncertainty analysis; Belief matrix; Combination rules; Dempster-Shafer theory; Linear solver; matrix; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Uncertain informations; Variational quantum algorithm; Variational quantum linear solv; Information fusion","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62373078)","The work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62373078 ).","Y.

Problems classified into this category are those whose picking policy consists of grouping the orders received in a warehouse into batches, prior to starting the picking process. Once the batches have been formed, all items within the same batch are picked together on a single picking route. In this survey we review the optimization problems known in this family, focusing on manual picking systems and rectangular-shaped warehouses with only parallel and cross aisles, which is the most common warehouse configuration in the literature. First, we identify the decisions within the strategic, tactical, and operational levels that influence the picking task. Then, we characterize the optimization problems belonging to this family, whose objective function might differ. The identified problems are classified into a taxonomy proposed in this paper, which is designed to host future problems within this family.

Nonetheless, a constant magnetic field can transiently ensnare an electron within the quantum dot, giving rise to what are known as “quasi-bound states” characterized by finite lifetimes. To prolong the retention of electrons within the quantum dot, we introduce a mass term into the Hamiltonian, thereby inducing an energy gap. We resolve the Dirac equation to ascertain the eigenspinors, and by ensuring their continuity at the boundaries, we investigate the scattering behavior. Our findings indicate that the presence of an energy gap can extend the lifetimes of these quasi-bound states within the quantum dot. In particular, we demonstrate that even in the absence of a magnetic field, the scattering efficiency attains significant levels when the energy gap gets closed to the incident energy of an electron traversing the quantum dot. It is found that an augmentation in the electron density within the quantum dot results in an enhancement of the electron-trapping time. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Circular quantum dot; Energy gap; Graphene; Magnetic field; Scattering phenomenon","Electrons; Energy gap; Linear equations; Magnetic fields; Nanocrystals; Semiconductor quantum dots; Circular quantum dot; Constant magnetic fields; Dirac's equation; Klein Tunneling; Localisation; Magnetic quantum dots; Magnetic-field; Quasibound state; Scattering phenomenon; Tunneling phenomena; Graphene","","","A.

Developing efficient regulation methods to reduce costs and increase yields has become a major challenge for actual production. This work proposed a framework for meeting this challenge and supporting the management of environmental regulation. Photosynthesis rate was used as the yield index, and a photosynthesis rate model was constructed using support vector regression. Moreover, a regulation cost function for light and CO2 was constructed. Then, the non-inferior solutions (NIS) for environmental regulation were determined by an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm Ⅱ (i-nsGA Ⅱ). The curvature theory was applied to calculate the optimal solution in the NIS set. A set of seedling tomato data was used to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method. Compared with the other two regulation methods (saturation regulation method and U-chord method), the results indicated that the proposed method had the best performance. About 80% of the maximum photosynthesis rate could be obtained at a regulation cost of about 51%. This research presents a new strategy for optimizing the greenhouse environment, which can be applied as a knowledge-informed expert system to manage environmental regulation. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Curvature theory; Environmental regulation; Multi-objective optimization; Photosynthesis rate; Regulation cost","Carbon dioxide; Cost functions; Curve fitting; Environmental regulations; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouses; Photosynthesis; Cost rates; Crop yield; Curvature theory; Greenhouse light; Multi-objectives optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Photosynthesis rate; Protected agricultures; Reduce costs; Regulation cost; Multiobjective optimization","National Bulk Vegetable Industry Technology System, (cars-23-c06); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020YFD1100602); Shanxi Provincial Key Research and Development Project, (2020NY-143, 2023-ZDLNY-66)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (CN) (Grant No. 2020YFD1100602 ); the Shaanxi Key Research and Development Program (CN) (Grant No. 2023-ZDLNY-66 ); the Shaanxi Key Research and Development Program (CN) (Grant No. 2020NY-143 ); and the Task of Post Expert of National Bulk Vegetable Industry Technology System (CN) (Grant No. cars-23-c06 ).

In these areas, graphs are often evolving in time: for example, connection links may fail due to temporary technical issues, meaning that edges of the graph cannot be traversed for some time interval and alternative paths have to be followed. In classical computation graphs have been implemented both explicitly through adjacency matrices/lists and symbolically as ordered binary decision diagrams. Moreover, ad-hoc visit procedures have been developed to deal with dynamically evolving graphs. Quantum computation, exploiting interference and entanglement, has provided an exponential speed-up for specific problems, e.g., database search and integer factorization. In the quantum framework everything must be represented and manipulated using reversible operators. This poses a challenge when one has to deal with traversals of dynamically evolving directed graphs. Graph traversals are not intrinsically reversible because of converging paths. In the case of dynamically evolving graphs also the creation/destruction of paths comes into play against reversibility. In this paper we propose a novel high level graph representation in quantum computation supporting dynamic connectivity typical of real-world network applications. Our procedure allows to encode any multigraph into a unitary matrix. We devise algorithms for computing the encoding that are optimal in terms of time and space and we show the effectiveness of the proposal with some examples. We describe how to react to edge/node failures in constant time. Furthermore, we present two methods to perform quantum random walks taking advantage of this encoding: with and without projectors. We implement and test our encoding obtaining that the theoretical bounds for the running time are confirmed by the empirical results and providing more details on the behavior of the algorithms over graphs of different densities. © 2023 The Authors","Edge-failure; Graphs; Quantum walks","Binary decision diagrams; Directed graphs; Graphic methods; Matrix algebra; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Search engines; Signal encoding; Applications domains; Edge failures; Encodings; Evolving graphs; Graph; Network planning; Network scheduling; Quantum walk; Routing networks; Scheduling and planning; Encoding (symbols)","Francesco Severi National Institute of Higher Mathematics, (CUP E53C22001930001)","Funding text 1: This work is partially supported by PRIN project NiRvAna - 20202FCJM CUP G23C22000400005 and GNCS INdAM project “Algoritmi Quantistici su Grafi” CUP E53C22001930001 . ; Funding text 2: This work is partially supported by PRIN project NiRvAna - 20202FCJM CUP G23C22000400005 and GNCS INdAM project “Algoritmi Quantistici su Grafi” CUP E53C22001930001.Carla Piazza reports financial support was provided by Government of Italy Ministry of Education, University and Research.

Bi2Te2Se has a simple band structure with a single Dirac cone on the surface and a large non-trivial bulk gap of 300 meV. To study the TI/SC interface, the Bi2Te2Se glass-coated microwire with a diameter of d = 17 µm was connected to copper leads on one side using superconducting alloy In2Bi (Tc = 5.6 K), and on the other side using gallium. The topologically nontrivial 3D superconductor (SC) In2Bi has proximity-induced superconductivity of topological surface states. To eliminate conventional contribution to superconductivity from the bulk, the resulting edge states of the TI/SC contact area were studied in magnetic fields above Hc2 in In2Bi. The h/2e oscillations of magnetoresistance (MR) in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields (up to 1 T) at the TI/SC interface were observed at various temperatures (4.2 k–1.5 K). To explain the observed oscillations, we used magnetic flux quantization, which requires a multiply connected geometry where flux can penetrate into normal regions surrounded by a superconductor. The effective width of the closed superconducting area of the TI/SC interface is determined to be 15 nm from an analysis of FFT spectra and the beats of the MR oscillations for two different directions of magnetic field. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","h/2e oscillations of magnetoresistance; magnetoresistance; proximity effect; superconductivity; thin microwire; topological insulator","Binary alloys; Bismuth alloys; Bismuth compounds; Electric insulators; Superconducting materials; Topological insulators; Topology; H/2e oscillation of magnetoresistance; Insulator-superconductor; Magnetic-field; Microwire; Proximity effects; Quantum oscillations; Simple++; Superconductor interface; Thin microwires; Topological insulators; Magnetoresistance","Moldova State Project, (20.80009.50007.02); National Science Foundation, NSF, (STC CIQM 1231319); Boeing","This work was supported by Moldova State Project #20.80009.50007.02, NSF through STC CIQM 1231319, the Boeing Company and the Keck Foundation.","L.

In particular, we examine the 9-7-9 AGNR heterostructures where the TSs are well-isolated from the conduction and valence subbands. This isolation effectively mitigates thermal noise of subbands arising from temperature fluctuations during charge transport. Moreover, when the TSs exhibit an orbital off-set, intriguing electron heat rectification phenomena are observed, primarily attributed to inter-TS electron Coulomb interactions. To enhance the heat rectification ratio (η Q), we manipulate the coupling strengths between the heat sources and the TSs by introducing asymmetrical lengths in the 9-AGNRs. This approach offers control over the rectification properties, enabling significant enhancements. Additionally, we introduce vacancies strategically positioned between the heat sources and the TSs to suppress phonon heat current. This arrangement effectively reduces the overall phonon heat current, while leaving the TSs unaffected. Our findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of electron heat current in AGNR heterostructures, highlighting the role of topological states, inter-TS electron Coulomb interactions, and the impact of structural modifications such as asymmetrical lengths and vacancy positioning. These results pave the way for the design and optimization of graphene-based devices with improved thermal management and efficient control of electron heat transport. © 2023 The Author(s).

It is found that the isolated VOPc molecules adsorbed on Bi(111) rotate around the center stemming from the weak interaction between the molecules and Bi(111) surface. When VOPc molecules assemble into 2D domains, they adopt the bilayer-by-bilayer mode from the beginning of growth. In VOPc ultrathin films, there are almost no domains with one molecular layer (ML) or 3 ML, only domains with 2 ML and 4 ML. Furthermore, the VOPc bilayer possesses a nested flat-laying structure, where the molecules have the orientation O-up in the lower layer and O-down in the upper layer. This results in a strong interlayer coupling within the nested bilayer and a relatively weak coupling between the bilayers, leading to bilayer-by-bilayer growth. © 2023","Bi(111); Scanning tunneling microscopy; Self-assembly; VOPc","Bismuth compounds; Molecules; Self assembly; Temperature; Ultrathin films; Vanadium compounds; Bi-layer; Bilayer growth; Interlayer coupling; Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy; Molecular layer; Phthalocyanine molecules; Upper layer; Vanadyl phthalocyanine; VOPc; Weak interactions; Scanning tunneling microscopy","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11804282); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (SWU-KQ22024)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 11804282) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (SWU-KQ22024).","T.

A critical issue to their development and scalability is the integration of multiple single photon sources in the circuits. One major category of single photon sources is based on quantum dots that are embedded in semiconductor optical nanowires (NWQD) that allow their accurate handing and deterministic integration. Successful integrations of such nanowires have been reported in high index platforms like silicon or silicon nitride, with adequate coupling efficiency due the modal characteristics compatibility. On the other hand, Silica-on-Silicon is a major integration platform, which combined with new fabrication approaches like direct laser writing, for the definition of optical structures with refractive index modification, can provide the fabrication of highly optimized and tailor-made circuits by rapid prototyping. Considering for the first time the integration scenario of NWQD in laser written silica-based waveguides it is shown that the low (∼10-3) achievable refractive index contrast imposes strict limitations on the compatibility of such waveguides with NWQD resulting in general in low coupling efficiency. By considering several design and fabrication issues, suitable integration approaches with adequate efficiency are demonstrated, while also the limitations and challenges are revealed thus triggering new research directions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Integrated optical circuits; Nanowires; Quantum computing; Quantum dot; Quantum photonics; Silica; Waveguides","Elementary particle sources; Nanocrystals; Nanowires; Optical waveguides; Particle beams; Photonic integration technology; Photons; Quantum computers; Quantum dot lasers; Quantum efficiency; Quantum optics; Refractive index; Semiconductor quantum dots; Silicon nitride; Timing circuits; Coupling efficiency; Critical issues; Integrated optical circuit; Optical integrated circuits; Optical nanowires; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Quantum dot; Quantum photonics; Single-photon source; Silica","Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation, ΕΛ.ΙΔ.Ε.Κ, (HFRI-FM17-640)","This research work was funded by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (H.F.R.I.) under the “First Call for H.F.R.I.

We report the facile synthesis of tungsten-based Lindqvist and Keggin-type POMs that degrade toxic chemical dyes, methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB), respectively. The Lindqvist POM, sodium hexatungstate, Na2W6O19, degrades MO under 100 W UV light irradiation within 15 min, whereas the Keggin POM, Ag4PW11VO40, degrades MB under 20 W visible light source within 180 min. The effect of various operating parameters, such as photocatalyst concentration, pH, time, and initial dye concentration, were assessed in the degradation of both dyes. The photoelectrochemical performance of the as-synthesized polyoxometalates shows that the Ag4PW11VO40 shows 2.4 times higher photocurrent density than Na2W6O19 at a potential of 0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Electrochemical impedance analysis reveals that Ag4PW11VO40 exhibits much lower charge transfer resistance as compared to Na2W6O19, which indicates facile charge transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Further Mott-Schottky measurements reveal that both the catalysts possess n-type semiconductivity and the charge carrier concentration of Ag4PW11VO40 (5.89 × 1019 cm−3) is 1.4 times higher as compared to Na2W6O19 (4.25 × 1019 cm−3).

This model is mapped onto a Kitaev-Creutz type model, providing a useful framework to understand the topology through a nontrivial winding number and the geometry introduced by the Fubini-Study (FS) metric. This metric allows us to distinguish between pure states of systems with the same topology and thus provides a suitable tool for obtaining the fingerprint of flat bands. Moreover, it provides an appealing geometrical picture for describing flat bands as it can be associated with a local conformal transformation over circles in a complex plane. In addition, the presented model allows us to relate the topology with the formation of compact localized states and pseudo-Bogoliubov modes. Also, the properties of the squared Hamiltonian are investigated in order to provide a better understanding of the localization properties and the spectrum. The presented model is equivalent to two coupled SSH chains under a change of basis. © 2023 The Author(s).

We use a normalization procedure to encode the SPH operators and domain discretization in a quantum register. We then perform the SPH summation via an inner product of quantum registers. Using a one-dimensional function, we test the approach in a classical sense for the kernel sum and first and second derivatives of a one-dimensional function, using both the Gaussian and Wendland kernel functions, and compare various register sizes against analytical results. Error convergence is exponentially fast in the number of qubits. We extend the method to solve the one-dimensional advection and diffusion partial differential equations, which are commonly encountered in fluids simulations.

Most existing TKG reasoning models transform time intervals into continuous time snapshots, with each snapshot representing a subgraph of the TKG. Although such processing can produce satisfactory outcomes, it ignores the integrity of a time interval and increases the amount of data. Meanwhile, many previous works focuses on the logic of sequentially occurring facts, disregarding the complex temporal logics of various time intervals. Consequently, we propose a Reinforcement Learning-based Model for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Time Intervals (RTTI), which focuses on time-aware multi-hop reasoning arising from complex time intervals. In RTTI, we construct the time learning part to obtain the time embedding of the current path. It simulates the temporal logic with relation historical encoding and compute the time interval between two facts through the temporal logic feature matrix. Furthermore, we propose a new method for representing time intervals that breaks the original time interval embedding method, and express the time interval using median and embedding changes of two timestamps. We evaluate RTTI on four public TKGs for the link prediction task, and experimental results indicate that our approach can still perform well on more complicated tasks. Meanwhile, our method can search for more interpretable paths in the broader space and improve the reasoning ability in sparse spaces. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Multi-hop reasoning; Reinforcement learning; Temporal knowledge graph; Temporal logic; Time interval","Computer circuits; Continuous time systems; Embeddings; Knowledge graph; Reinforcement learning; Embeddings; Knowledge graphs; Multi-hop reasoning; Multi-hops; Reasoning methods; Reinforcement learnings; Temporal knowledge; Temporal knowledge graph; Temporal reasoning; Time interval; Temporal logic","2022 Industrial Internet Innovation and Development Engineering Project, (JCKY2020604C011, TC220H055); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFC3320302)","This work is funded by National Key R&D Program of China ( 2021YFC3320302 ), 2022 Industrial Internet Innovation and Development Engineering Project ( TC220H055 ), and Basic Research Program (No. JCKY2020604C011 ).","Z.

In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing era, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is expected as an effective method to solve quantum chemistry problems which has potential quantum advantage. Classically simulating quantum algorithms plays a critical role in algorithmic development and the validation of noisy quantum devices before large-scale, fully fault-tolerant quantum computers are developed. However, most existing simulators are based on the state vector or density matrix representation of the quantum state which is faced with the memory bottleneck due to the exponential growth of memory requirement as the number of qubits increases. In this work, we present a VQE simulator based on the matrix product states (MPS) method from quantum many-body physics, and a detailed study of our MPS-VQE simulator in quantum chemistry applications. The memory requirement of MPS-VQE grows only polynomially and we demonstrate that accurate results can be obtained despite the truncation of the smallest singular values during the algorithm. A distributed parallelization scheme is also presented for massively parallel computer systems, and different implementations of the parallelization scheme based on the Julia language are benchmarked which demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our method.

In contrast to classical computing, quantum computing holds the potential with exponential advantages and promises to overcome the bottleneck in computing performance. Taking inspiration from the convolution and pooling operations of convolutional neural networks, a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) is designed based on pure variational quantum circuits. By combining the advantages of angle encoding and amplitude encoding, a tree-structured hybrid amplitude encoding method has been developed. This method provides flexibility and stability in adjusting the width and the depth of the quantum circuit required for data encoding. Experiments conducted on the MNIST dataset and the Fashion-MNIST dataset demonstrate that the QCNN achieves faster convergence speed and higher image classification accuracy than the classical convolutional neural networks. Specifically, the QCNN reaches convergence after just 50 iterations, whereas the classical counterpart requires more than 200 iterations to converge. Furthermore, when performing the PCA dimensionality reduction to 8, the QCNN with Circuit 6 achieves an accuracy of 98.54% on the MNIST dataset, while the classical counterpart achieves only 86.32%. © 2023","Image classification; Pure variational quantum circuits; Quantum convolutional neural network; Quantum machine learning; Tree-structured hybrid amplitude encoding","Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Encoding (symbols); Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Network coding; Quantum computers; Timing circuits; Convolutional neural network; Encodings; Images classification; Machine-learning; Pure variational quantum circuit; Quantum circuit; Quantum convolutional neural network; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Tree-structured; Tree-structured hybrid amplitude encoding; Image classification","Science & Technology Planning Project of Shanghai, (23010501800); Top Double 1000 Talent Programme of Jiangxi Province, (JXSQ2019201055); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62162041)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62162041 ), the Science & Technology Planning Project of Shanghai (Grant No. 23010501800 ), and the Top Double 1000 Talent Programme of Jiangxi Province (Grant No. JXSQ2019201055 ).","N.-R.

In this study, the performance of fuzzy c-means (FCM)-clustered adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was compared with the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) in investigating the impact of critical process parameters, namely temperature, retention time, and mixing ratio on the methane yield of anaerobic co-digestion of duck waste and Xyris capensis. Relevant statistical metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute deviation (MAD) was used to evaluate the performance of the FCM-ANFIS model developed. The developed RSM and FCM-ANFIS models were compared based on the predicted yields and optimum conditions. It was observed from the results that the process parameters have a significant influence on the methane yield of anaerobic co-digestion of duck waste and Xyris capensis. The cumulative yield of 478.42, 478.43, and 436.20 mL CH4/g VSadded was observed for experimental, RSM, and ANFIS-FCM5clusters models, respectively. The optimum daily methane yield was observed when the mixing ratio was 75% duck waste and 25% Xyris capensis for the experimental and ANFIS-FCM5 clusters model. In contrast, the RSM model observed it at 100% duck waste. The RMSE, MAD, MAE, and MAPE values of the optimal neuro-fuzzy model (ANFIS-FCM5clusters) test indicated that the neuro-fuzzy model developed performs better than the RSM model with minimal error and higher accuracy. RSM and ANFIS models were noticed to be practical models for methane yield optimization and prediction from anaerobic co-digestion of livestock waste and lignocellulose feedstocks in a multiple-input variable without undertaking an experiment within a short time and error. These models can be used to optimize the anaerobic digestion process of lignocellulose materials and livestock waste at the industrial scale. © 2023 The Author(s)","Anaerobic co-digestion; ANFIS model; Methane; Optimization; Prediction; RSM","Agriculture; Anaerobic digestion; Errors; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Lignin; Mean square error; Mixing; Surface properties; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system model; Anaerobic co-digestion; Fuzzy-c means; Methane Yield; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Neuro-fuzzy modeling; Optimisations; Response-surface methodology; System models; Methane","","","K.O.

However, the persistent challenge of widely distributed dislocation-related etch pits on processed surfaces remains poorly understood. In this study, the material removal and pit formation during the etching of the dislocation region by hydrogen and oxygen were investigated by reactive force-field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulation combined with experimental verification. The results unveiled the pivotal role of crystal structure disruption and symmetrically distributed stress, induced by dislocations, in promoting bond-breaking processes and triggering the formation of etch pits. The etching parameter optimized simulations revealed that once the impact effect of oxygen atoms counterbalances the promotion of dislocation to the bond breaking, the formation of dislocation pits can be effectively avoided, which is convincingly validated by experimental results. Besides, our research further verified that pure hydrogen etching is an inefficient surface post-treatment process with a more significant pit-forming problem, and exists two distinct pit-forming mechanisms dependent on the incident energy. Additionally, substrate temperature variation has global but negligible influences on pits formation within the 400 K range.

Substrate engineering is one of the critical factors that influence the growth of the epitaxial h-BN films. Here, we report the growth of monolayer h-BN on Ni (111) substrates incorporated with oxygen atoms via molecular beam epitaxy. It was found that the increase of incorporated oxygen concentration in the Ni substrate through a pretreatment process prior to the h-BN growth step would have an adverse effect on the morphology and growth rate of 2D h-BN. Under the same growth condition, h-BN monolayer coverage decreases exponentially as the amount of oxygen incorporated into Ni (111) increases. Density functional theory calculations and climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method reveal that the substitutional oxygen atoms can increase the diffusion energy barrier of B and N atoms on Ni (111) thereby inhibiting the growth of h-BN films. As-grown large-area h-BN monolayer films and fabricated Al/h-BN/Ni (MIM) nanodevices were comprehensively characterized to evaluate the structural, optical and electrical properties of high-quality monolayers. Direct tunneling mechanism and high breakdown strength of ∼11.2 MV cm−1 are demonstrated for the h-BN monolayers grown on oxygen-incorporated Ni (111) substrates, indicating that these films have high quality. This study provides a unique example that heterogeneous catalysis principles can be applied to the epitaxy of 2D crystals in solid state field. Similar strategies can be used to grow other 2D crystalline materials, and are expected to facilitate the development of next generation devices based on 2D crystals. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd","catalyst-assisted growth; hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN); molecular beam epitaxy (MBE); two dimensional (2D) materials","Atoms; Boron nitride; Catalysis; Density functional theory; Growth rate; III-V semiconductors; Molecular beams; Molecular oxygen; Monolayers; Morphology; Nitrides; Substrates; 2D-hexagonal; Catalyst-assisted growth; Hexagonal boron nitride; Hexagonal boron nitride films; Molecular beam epitaxy; Molecular-beam epitaxy; Ni(111); Two dimensional (2d) material; Two-dimensional; ]+ catalyst; Molecular beam epitaxy","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2137603, 2138259, 2138286, 2138296, 2138307, NSF CAREER-2046648); Office of Postsecondary Education, OPE, (200A210031); University of California, Riverside, UCR, (DMR130081); Ucross Foundation","This work was supported by the UCR Foundation and UCR Academic Senate Committee on Research grant.

Nanodiamonds (NDs) are more biocompatible and have lower cytotoxicity than other carbon-based nanomaterials. The cytotoxicity of NDs depends on their properties and the exposure time. NDs must enter the cell in most cellular applications; therefore, toxicity assessments are required to validate the uses of NDs. In vitro cytotoxicity tests are an important part of assessing NDs' safety because they are simple, relevant, repeatable, less expensive, and easy to control. NDs exhibit high biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity in in vitro assessments. As opposed to research using living cells, in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility analyses use animal models to investigate the possible effects of NDs on human health. Insoluble nanoparticles, such as NDs, result in intracellular reactive oxygen species production. In nanotoxicology, the generation of oxidative stress is crucial. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

For N particles with onsite attractive energy U and hopping amplitude between sites t, Cat states exist for u≡UN2t<-1 at zero temperature. However, they are increasingly unstable to small thermal fluctuations as the Cat itself is increasingly well-defined and its components become well-separated. For any given u< - 1 , the decoherence temperature becomes smaller for large N. The loss of off-diagonal coherence peaks in the equilibrium density matrix is dominated by the thermal admixture of the first excited state of the many-body system with its ground state. Particle number fluctuations, described in the grand canonical ensemble also reduce coherence, but to a lesser degree than thermal fluctuations. The full density matrix of the Schrödinger Cat is obtained by exact numerical diagonalization of the many-body Hamiltonian and a narrow regime in the parameter space of the particle number, temperature, and U/t is identified where small Cat states may survive decoherence in a physical environment. © 2023, The Author(s).","","article","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","This work was supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

Based on first-principles calculations, we report the observation of half-integer conductance quantization in the Cobalt-fulvalene sandwich nanowire. Compared with a pure monatomic Cobalt wire, the introduction of fulvalene molecules leads to three important features: Firstly, the strong coupling between the fulvalene and the Cobalt prevents the contamination of the ambient air, ensuring both chemical and physical stabilities; Secondly, the fulvalene symmetry-selectively filters out most of the d-type orbitals of the Cobalt while leaving a single d-type orbital to form an open spin channel around the Fermi level, which offers a mechanism to achieve the observed half-integer conductance; Thirdly, it maintains a superexchange coupling between adjacent Co atoms to achieve a high Curie temperature. Spin transport calculations show that this half-metallic nanowire can serve as a perfect spin filter or a spin valve device, thus revealing the potential of Cobalt-fulvalene sandwich nanowire as a promising building block of high-performance spintronics technology. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Chemical bonds; Nanowires; Conductance quantization; D types; First principle calculations; Important features; One-dimensional (1D) system; Orbitals; Precise manipulation; Precise monitoring; Spin transport; Strong-coupling; Cobalt","ArRF, (MOE-T2EP50221-0019, MOE2019-T2-2-030, SKI 2021_01_12); Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE","Y.S.A. is supported by the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) Academic Research Fund (ArRF) Tier 2 Grant (MOE-T2EP50221-0019) and the SUTD Kickstarter Initiatives (SKI) under the Award No. SKI 2021_01_12.

However, it remains a challenging task nowadays to accurately predict the canonical tautomeric form of a given drug-like molecule. Lack of extensive tautomer databases, most likely due to the difficulty in experimental studies, hampers the development of effective empirical methods for tautomer predictions. A more accurate estimation of the stable tautomeric form can be achieved by quantum chemistry calculations. Yet, the computational cost required prevents quantum chemistry calculation as a standard tool for tautomer prediction in computer-aided drug discovery. In this paper we propose a hybrid quantum chemistry-quantum computation workflow to efficiently predict the dominant tautomeric form. Specifically, we select active-space molecular orbitals based on quantum chemistry methods. Then we utilize efficient encoding methods to map the Hamiltonian onto quantum devices to reduce the qubit resources and circuit depth. Finally, variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms are employed for ground state estimation where hardware-efficient ansatz circuits are used. To demonstrate the applicability of our methodology, we perform experiments on two tautomeric systems: acetone and Edaravone, each having 52 and 150 spin-orbitals in the Slater Type Orbital - 3 Gaussian (STO-3G) basis set, respectively. Our numerical results show that their tautomeric state prediction agrees with the Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) benchmarks. Moreover, the required quantum resources are efficient: in the example of Edaravone, we could achieve chemical accuracy with only eight qubits and 80 two-qubit gates. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Acetone; Computational chemistry; Computational efficiency; Ground state; Molecular orbitals; Numerical methods; Qubits; Accurate estimation; Computer-aided drug discovery; Edaravone; Empirical method; Most likely; Quantum chemistry calculations; Quantum simulations; State prediction; Tautomeric forms; Tautomerics; Forecasting","","","Y.-C.

After factoring out the U(1) phase eiϕ , this form of superconductivity admits yet additional complex structure in the plane of (Δ s, Δ 5) . The polar angle χ in this plane, which we call the chiral angle, can be controlled by the external flux bias. We present a synthetic setup based on stacking of topological insulators (TIs) and superconductors (SCs). Alternatively flux biasing the superconductors with a fluxes ± Φ leads to Δ 5= Δ sin (χ) , where Δ is the superconducting order parameter of the SC layers, and the chiral angle χ= 2 πΦ / Φ is directly given by the flux Φ in units of the flux quantum Φ = h/ (2 e) . This can be used as a building block to construct a two-dimensional Josephson array. In this setup χ will be a background field defining a pseudoscalar Δ 5 that can be tuned to desired configuration. While in a uniform background field Δ 5 the dynamics of ϕ is given by standard XY model and its associated vortices, a staggered background ± Δ 5 (or equivalently χ and χ+ π in alternating lattice sites) creates a new set of minima for the ϕ field that will support half-vortex excitations. An isolated single engineered “half-vortex” in the χ field in an otherwise uniform background will bind a ϕ -half-vortex. This is similar to the way a p-wave superconducting vortex core binds a Majorana fermion. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, AvH; Sharif University of Technology, SUT; Iran's National Elites Foundation, INEF","S.

Here we investigate the stabilization of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV−) centers in phosphorus-doped diamond at liquid helium temperatures. Photoionization of phosphorous donors in conjunction with charge diffusion at the nanoscale enhances NV0 to NV− conversion and stabilizes the NV− charge state without the need for an additional repump laser. The phosphorus-assisted stabilization is explored and confirmed both with experiments and our theoretical model. Stable photoluminescence-excitation spectra are obtained for NV− centers created during the growth. The fluorescence is continuously recorded under resonant excitation to real-time monitor the charge state and the ionization and recombination rates are extracted from time traces. We find a linear laser power dependence of the recombination rate as opposed to the conventional quadratic dependence, which is attributed to the photo-ionization of phosphorus atoms. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Atom lasers; Excited states; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Photoionization; Quantum theory; Semiconductor doping; Superfluid helium; Charge state; Lows-temperatures; Negatively charged; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Phosphorus-doped diamond; Quantum technologies; Recombination rate; Spin systems; Spin-s systems; Stabilization","European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program AMADEUS, (101080136); Spintronics Research Network of Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (21H04653); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (JPMXS0118067395); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (13N16219); Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University, ICR, (2022-72)","We acknowledge financial support by European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program AMADEUS under grant No. 101080136, Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) project MiLiQuant, Quamapolis, and Cluster4Future-QSens, as well as SPINNING under grant No.13N16219.

This study seeks to 1) investigate the effects of low-stock message, activity message, countdown timer, and limited-time message dark patterns and its influence on product selection decisions, 2) determine if demographic variables would predict susceptibility to dark patterns, and 3) explore the effectiveness of video- and activity-based dark patterns awareness intervention. 195 adult volunteers aged 19 to 53 participated in this experiment. Results indicated that participants were significantly more likely to select products with dark patterns. The use of limited-time message dark pattern was significantly more effective than other dark patterns in inducing consumption. Older individuals tend to be more susceptible to dark patterns. No clear evidence for the effectiveness of video- and activity-based dark patterns awareness intervention was found. Several study limitations were noted. We note how companies can support cleaner and responsible consumption by refraining from using dark patterns. On individuals, the implications of dark patterns on unintended consumption, in a world with aging populations and post-pandemic accelerated e-commerce were discussed. © 2023 The Authors","","","","","Y.Z.

Nanopore sequencing offers expanded applications compared to previous sequencing techniques but produces a large amount of data in the form of current measurements over time. The analysis of these segments of current measurements require more complex and computationally intensive algorithms than previous sequencing technologies. The purpose of this study is to investigate in principle the potential of using quantum computers to speed up Nanopore data analysis. Quantum circuits are designed to extract major features of squiggle current measurements. The circuits are analyzed theoretically in terms of size and performance. Practical experiments on IBM QX show the limitations of the state of the art quantum computer to tackle real life squiggle data problems. Nevertheless, pre-processing of the squiggle data using the inverse wavelet transform, as experimented and analyzed in this paper as well, reduces the dimensionality of the problem in order to fit a reasonable size quantum computer in the hopefully near future. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","","","Alberta Bioinformatics Network; Alberta Ministry of Economic Development, Trade, and Tourism; Genome Canada, GC; Government of Alberta; Canada Research Chairs; Alberta Innovates, AI","This research has been supported by the Alberta Ministry of Economic Development, Trade, and Tourism as part of the Quantum Major Innovation Fund Project (QMP), and by Genome Canada and the Government of Alberta as part of the Alberta Bioinformatics Network.

Circuit cutting technology has greatly alleviated this problem, which allows us to run larger quantum circuits on real quantum machines with currently limited qubit resources at the cost of additional classical overhead. However, the classical overhead of circuit cutting grows exponentially with the number of cuts and qubits, and the excessive postprocessing overhead makes it difficult to apply circuit cutting to large scale circuits. In this paper, we propose a fast reconstruction algorithm based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling, which samples the high probability solutions by Hamiltonian dynamics from state space with dimension growing exponentially with qubit. Our algorithm avoids excessive computation when reconstructing the original circuit probability distribution, and greatly reduces the circuit cutting post-processing overhead. The improvement is crucial for expanding of circuit cutting to a larger scale on NISQ devices. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; probability; reconstruction algorithm","","","Z.

In recent years, both quantum computing and machine learning have shown great promise in the field of document classification. However, there is a lack of research investigating the performance of these techniques on the Arabic language. This paper presents a comparative study of quantum computing and machine learning for two datasets of Arabic language document classification. In the first dataset of 213,465 Arabic tweets, both classic machine learning (ML) and quantum computing approaches achieve high accuracy in sentiment analysis, with quantum computing slightly outperforming classic ML. Quantum computing completes the task in approximately 59 min, slightly faster than classic ML, which takes around 1 h. The precision, recall, and F1 score metrics indicate the effectiveness of both approaches in predicting sentiment in Arabic tweets. Classic ML achieves precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.8215, 0.8175, and 0.8121, respectively, while quantum computing achieves values of 0.8239, 0.8199, and 0.8147, respectively. In the second dataset of 44,000 tweets, both classic ML (using the Random Forest algorithm) and quantum computing demonstrate significantly reduced processing times compared to the first dataset, with no substantial difference between them. Classic ML completes the analysis in approximately 2 min, while quantum computing takes approximately 1 min and 53 s. The accuracy of classic ML is higher at 0.9241 compared to 0.9205 for quantum computing. However, both approaches achieve high precision, recall, and F1 scores, indicating their effectiveness in accurately predicting sentiment in the dataset. Classic ML achieves precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.9286, 0.9241, and 0.9249, respectively, while quantum computing achieves values of 0.92456, 0.9205, and 0.9214, respectively. The analysis of the metrics indicates that quantum computing approaches are effective in identifying positive instances and capturing relevant sentiment information in large datasets. On the other hand, traditional machine learning techniques exhibit faster processing times when dealing with smaller dataset sizes. This study provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of quantum computing and machine learning for Arabic document classification, emphasizing the potential of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy, particularly in scenarios where traditional machine learning techniques may encounter difficulties. These findings contribute to the development of more accurate and efficient document classification systems for Arabic data. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Computing Methodologies; Humans; Language; Machine Learning; Quantum Theory; Sentiment Analysis; Social Media; Arabic (language); article; comparative study; controlled study; human; human experiment; machine learning; random forest; recall; sentiment analysis; social media; computer analysis; language; machine learning; quantum theory; sentiment analysis","Department of Computer Science, Saarland University","Authors sincerely acknowledge Computer Science Department in Faculty of Science, Minia University for the facilities and support.","A.

By leveraging the intrinsic symmetry of finite groups, the Hilbert space can be decomposed and the Hamiltonians block diagonalized to enable extremely fast quantum optimal control calculations. Our approach reduces the Hamiltonian size of an n-qubit system from 2 n × 2 n to O ( n × n ) or O ( ( 2 n / n ) × ( 2 n / n ) ) under Sn or Dn symmetry, respectively. Most importantly, this approach reduces the computational runtime of qubit optimal control calculations by orders of magnitude while maintaining the same accuracy as the conventional method. As prospective applications, we show that (1) symmetry-protected subspaces can be potential platforms for quantum error suppression and simulation of other quantum Hamiltonians and (2) Lie-Trotter-Suzuki decomposition approaches can generalize our method to a general variety of multi-qubit systems. © 2023 Author(s).","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Energy Technology Laboratory, NETL, (DE-FE0031896)","This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), under Award No. DE-FE0031896.

Adversely, ferromagnetism and superconductivity are typically also two hostile orderings competing to align spins in different configurations, and thus making the material design and experimental implementation extremely challenging. A single material platform with concurrent ferromagnetism and superconductivity is actively pursued. In this paper, we fabricate van der Waals Josephson junctions made with iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se), and report the global device-level transport signatures of interfacial ferromagnetism emerging with superconducting states for the first time. Magnetic hysteresis in the junction resistance is observed only below the superconducting critical temperature, suggesting an inherent correlation between ferromagnetic and superconducting order parameters. The 0-π phase mixing in the Fraunhofer patterns pinpoints the ferromagnetism on the junction interface. More importantly, a stochastic field-free superconducting diode effect was observed in Josephson junction devices, with a significant diode efficiency up to 10%, which unambiguously confirms the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work demonstrates a new way to search for topological superconductivity in iron-based superconductors for future high Tc fault-tolerant qubit implementations from a device perspective. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","ferromagnetic material; iron; correlation; hysteresis; performance assessment; superconductivity; symmetry; Article; controlled study; critical temperature; hysteresis; magnetism; scanning electron microscopy; stochastic model; superconductivity","Fibertek Inc.; Fibertek, Inc., (20-F-0023); National Science Foundation, NSF, (1936383, 2040737); U.S. Department of Defense, DOD; National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, (70NANB22H101); Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-16-1-0472, W911NF-20- 2-0166); U.S. Department of Commerce, DOC; Government of South Australia","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the NSF under Grants No. 1936383 and No. 2040737, the U.S. Army Research Office MURI program under Grants No. W911NF-20- 2-0166 and No. W911NF-16-1-0472.

However, cat states, normally generated in three-dimensional cavities and/or strong multi-photon drives, are facing the challenges of scalability and controllability. Here, we present a strategy to generate and preserve cat states in a coplanar superconducting circuit by the fast modulation of Kerr nonlinearity. At the Kerr-free work point, our cat states are passively preserved due to the vanishing Kerr effect. We are able to prepare a 2-component cat state in our chip-based device with a fidelity reaching 89.1% under a 96 ns gate time. Our scheme shows an excellent route to constructing a chip-based bosonic quantum processor. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","equipment; error correction; instrumentation; superconductivity; three-dimensional modeling; article; cat; nonhuman; nonlinear system","Shanghai Technology Innovation Action Plan Integrated Circuit Technology Support Program, (22DZ1100200); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (92065116); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDA18000000); Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse; Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2015-00152); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B0303030002); Wallenberg Center for Quantum Technology, Chalmers University of Technology, WACQT","The authors acknowledge the use of the Nanofabrication Laboratory (NFL) at Chalmers.

One of them is a Grassmann Fokker–Planck equation that can be re-cast into a remarkably simple Itô form involving solely complex variables. In spite of this simple form, we demonstrate that complications arise in numerically computing the expectation value of any observable.

The complexity of exactly describing the system-environment interaction with the HEOM method usually results in time-consuming calculations and a large memory cost.

HierarchicalEOM.jl features a collection of methods to compute bosonic and fermionic spectra, stationary states, and the full dynamics in the extended space of all auxiliary density operators (ADOs). The required handling of the ADOs multi-indexes is achieved through a user-friendly interface. We exemplify the functionalities of the package by analyzing a single impurity Anderson model, and an ultra-strongly coupled charge-cavity system interacting with bosonic and fermionic reservoirs.

However, scalable superconducting memory still poses a challenge. To address this issue, we present an alternative to approaches that solely emphasize storage cell miniaturization by exploiting the minimal attenuation and dispersion properties of superconducting passive transmission lines to develop a delay-line memory system. This fully superconducting design operates at speeds between 20 and 100 GHz, with ± 24% and ± 13% bias margins, respectively, and demonstrates data densities in the 10s of Mbit/cm2 with the MIT Lincoln Laboratory SC2 fabrication process. Additionally, the circulating nature of this design allows for minimal control circuitry, eliminates the need for data splitting and merging, and enables inexpensive implementations of sequential access and content-addressable memories. Further advances in fabrication processes suggest data densities of 100s of Mbit/cm2 and beyond. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","","","J.

However, thresholds for fault-tolerant quantum error correction are given in terms of worst-case error rates—defined via the diamond norm—which can differ from average error rates by orders of magnitude. One method for resolving this discrepancy is to randomize the physical implementation of quantum gates, using techniques like randomized compiling (RC). In this work, we use gate set tomography to perform precision characterization of a set of two-qubit logic gates to study RC on a superconducting quantum processor. We find that, under RC, gate errors are accurately described by a stochastic Pauli noise model without coherent errors, and that spatially correlated coherent errors and non-Markovian errors are strongly suppressed. We further show that the average and worst-case error rates are equal for randomly compiled gates, and measure a maximum worst-case error of 0.0197(3) for our gate set. Our results show that randomized benchmarks are a viable route to both verifying that a quantum processor’s error rates are below a fault-tolerance threshold, and to bounding the failure rates of near-term algorithms, if—and only if—gates are implemented via randomization methods which tailor noise. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Computer circuits; Error correction; Failure analysis; Fault tolerance; Logic gates; Markov processes; Quantum noise; Quantum theory; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Average errors; Error process; Error rate; Fault-tolerant; Gate sets; Logic operations; Quantum error corrections; Quantum logic; Quantum processors; Worst case error; Benchmarking","Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research Quantum Testbed Program, (DE-AC02-05CH11231); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC","This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research Quantum Testbed Program under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 and the Quantum Testbed Pathfinder Program.

Such superiority, however, can be diminished due to unavoidable noise and decoherence of the probe. Thus, metrological strategies to fight against or profit from decoherence are highly desirable. This is the case of certain types of decoherence-driven many-body systems supporting dissipative phase transitions, which might be helpful for sensing. Boundary time crystals are exotic dissipative phases of matter in which the time-translational symmetry is broken, and long-lasting oscillations emerge in open quantum systems at the thermodynamic limit. We show that the transition from a symmetry unbroken into a boundary time crystal phase, described by a second-order transition, reveals quantum-enhanced sensitivity quantified through quantum Fisher information. We also determine the critical exponents of the system and establish their relationship. Our scheme is indeed a demonstration of harnessing decoherence for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity. From a practical perspective, it has the advantage of being independent of initialization and can be captured by a simple measurement. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Crystal symmetry; Crystals; Fisher information matrix; Quantum optics; Classical counterpart; Decoherence; Enhanced sensitivity; Long lasting; Many-body systems; Open quantum systems; Quantum metrology; Quantum technologies; Thermodynamic limits; Translational symmetry; Phase transitions","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12050410251, 12274059, 92065115); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST, (QNJ2021167001L); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2022T150098); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFA0306703)","A.B. acknowledges support from the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFA0306703), the National Science Foundation of China (Grants Nos. 12050410253, 92065115, and 12274059), and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant No. QNJ2021167001L).

Making the direct leap from academic fabrication to qubits fully fabricated by industrial CMOS standards is difficult without intermediate solutions. With a flexible back-end-of-line (BEOL), functionalities such as micromagnets or superconducting circuits can be added in a post-CMOS process to study the physics of these devices or achieve proofs-of-concept. Once the process is established, it can be incorporated in the foundry-compatible process flow. Here, we study a single electron spin qubit in a CMOS device with a micromagnet integrated in the flexible BEOL. We exploit the synthetic spin orbit coupling (SOC) to control the qubit via electric fields and we investigate the spin-valley physics in the presence of SOC where we show an enhancement of the Rabi frequency at the spin-valley hotspot. Finally, we probe the high frequency noise in the system using dynamical decoupling pulse sequences and demonstrate that charge noise dominates the qubit decoherence in this range. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","CMOS integrated circuits; Electric fields; Electrospinning; Flexible electronics; Landforms; MOS devices; Oxide semiconductors; Spin dynamics; Back end of lines; Complementary metal oxide semiconductor process; Complementary metal oxide semiconductors; Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technologies; Electrical manipulation; Micromagnets; Single electron spin; Spin qubit; Spin-orbit couplings; Superconducting circuit; Qubits","CRYMCO, (810504, 951852); Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR","We acknowledge technical support from L.

Here, the potential of producing high-quality graphene at a large scale via water-phase exfoliation methods is investigated. By altering exfoliation parameters, the production yield of graphene and flake size are evaluated. Pretreatment of the precursor graphite powder using acidic solutions of H2SO4 at different concentrations is found to increase further the yield and structural quality of the exfoliated graphene flakes. These findings are confirmed through various spectroscopy and surface characterization techniques.

A potential intervention is modulation of the composition of gut microbiota, and in fact, probiotic treatment has been proposed and tried in human atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. Since dogs are currently receiving intensive medical care, this will be the same option for dogs, while evidence of gut dysbiosis in cAD is still missing, although skin microbial profiling in cAD has been conducted in several studies. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of both gut and skin microbiota in cAD in one specific cAD-predisposed breed, Shiba Inu. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of commonly used medical management on cAD (Janus kinase; JAK inhibitor, oclacitinib) on the gut and skin microbiota. Furthermore, we genotyped the Shiba Inu dogs according to the mitochondrial DNA haplogroup and assessed its association with the composition of the gut microbiota. Results: Staphylococcus was the most predominant bacterial genus observed in the skin; Escherichia/Shigella and Clostridium sensu stricto were highly abundant in the gut of cAD-affected dogs. In the gut microbiota, Fusobacteria and Megamonas were highly abundant in healthy dogs but significantly reduced in cAD-affected dogs. The abundance of these bacterial taxa was positively correlated with the effect of the treatment and state of the disease. Oclacitinib treatment on cAD-affected dogs shifted the composition of microbiota towards that in healthy dogs, and the latter brought it much closer to healthy microbiota, particularly in the gut. Additionally, even within the same dog breed, the mtDNA haplogroup varied, and there was an association between the mtDNA haplogroup and microbial composition in the gut and skin. Conclusions: Dysbiosis of both the skin and the gut was observed in cAD in Shiba Inu dogs. Our findings provide a basis for the potential treatment of cAD by manipulating the gut microbiota as well as the skin microbiota.

To overcome the intrinsic electron spin lifetime limit in spectral resolution, a heterodyne detection approach is widely used. However, application of this technique at high magnetic fields is yet an unsolved problem. Here, we introduce a heterodyne detection method utilizing a series of phase coherent electron nuclear double resonance sensing blocks, thus eliminating the numerous Rabi microwave pulses required in the detection. Our detection protocol can be extended to high magnetic fields, allowing chemical shift resolution in NMR experiments. We demonstrate this principle on a weakly coupled 13C nuclear spin in the bath surrounding single NV centers, and compare the results to existing heterodyne protocols. Additionally, we identify the combination of NV-spin-initialization infidelity and strong sensor-target-coupling as linewidth-limiting decoherence source, paving the way towards high-field heterodyne NMR protocols with chemical resolution. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Chemical detection; Chemical shift; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Electrospinning; Heterodyne detection; Heterodyning; Magnetic fields; Nanomagnetics; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Spin dynamics; Detection approach; Electron spins; High magnetic fields; High resolution; Magnetic-field; Nano scale; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Resonance signals; Spin lifetimes; Unsolved problems; Magnetic moments","European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program ASTERIQS, (820394); European Research Council, ERC, (742610); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (FOR 2724); Volkswagen Foundation; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, MPG","We acknowledge financial support by European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program ASTERIQS under grant No. 820394, European Research Council advanced grant No. 742610, SMel, Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) project MiLiQuant and Quamapolis, the DFG (FOR 2724), the Max Planck Society, and the Volkswagentiftung.

CDK4 overexpression is by far more common than amplification in sarcomas and it might be a rational target for CDK inhibitors. Preclinical investigators of this study found that CDK4 overexpression, while not of CDKN2A, was the most consistent predictive factor for palbociclib efficacy in sarcomas. Advanced adult-type soft-tissue sarcoma, excluding DD-LPS, or bone sarcoma patients, progressing after at least one systemic line, whose tumors overexpressed CDK4, but not CDKN2A at baseline biopsy, were accrued in this single-arm phase II trial (EudraCT number: 2016-004039-19). With the main endpoint of a 6-month PFS rate, 40% was considered promising in this population. Palbociclib was administered orally at 125 mg/day for 21 days in 28-day cycles. A total of 214 patients with 236 CDK4/CDKN2A determinations were assessed for prescreening, archival material (141), and screening, baseline biopsy (95). There were 28 (29%) with favorable mRNA profiles from 95 screened patients at baseline. From 23 enrolled patients, 21 evaluable, the 6-month PFS rate was 29% (95% CI 9–48), and there were 6 patients out of 21 with a PFS longer than 6 months. The median PFS and overall survival were 4.2 (95% CI 3.6–4.8) and 12 (95% CI 8.7–15.4) months, respectively. Translational research showed a significant correlation between CDK4 mRNA and protein expression. Palbociclib was active in a variety of sarcoma subtypes, selected by CDK4/CDKN2A, and deserves further investigation in the sarcoma context. © 2023, West China Hospital, Sichuan University.","","Adult; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16; Humans; Lipopolysaccharides; Piperazines; RNA, Messenger; Sarcoma; cyclin dependent kinase 4; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A; cyclin E; genomic DNA; messenger RNA; palbociclib; transcription factor E2F1; CDK4 protein, human; CDKN2A protein, human; cyclin dependent kinase 4; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A; lipopolysaccharide; messenger RNA; palbociclib; piperazine derivative; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; biopsy technique; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; controlled study; copy number variation; DNA extraction; female; fluorometry; follow up; gene expression; gene mutation; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; male; overall survival; phase 2 clinical trial; progressing sarcoma; progressing sarcoma; progression free survival; protein expression; sarcoma; soft tissue sarcoma; spectrophotometry; survival rate; clinical trial; genetics; metabolism; sarcoma","Fundacion Científica, (AECC-GEACC19007MA); GEIS; National Institute of Health Carlos III; Spanish Group for Research on Sarcomas; Pfizer; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (825806); Cancer Research UK, CRUK, (C56167/A29363); Instituto de Salud Carlos III, ISCIII, (CD20/00155); Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro, AIRC, (AIRC-24297)","The authors also thank the donors and all the hospitals for participating in patient screening/pre-screening.

For long-range interactions with a power-law form (1/r  α), the theorem further forbids ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order at finite temperature when α ≥ 2D. However, the situation for α ∈ (2, 4) at D = 2 is not covered by the theorem. To address this, we conduct large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis. Our findings show spontaneous breaking of S U(2) symmetry in the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model with 1/r  α-form long-range interactions at D = 2. We determine critical exponents through finite-size analysis for α < 3 (above the upper critical dimension with Gaussian fixed point) and 3 ≤ α < 4 (below the upper critical dimension with non-Gaussian fixed point). These results reveal new critical behaviors in 2D long-range Heisenberg models, encouraging further experimental studies of quantum materials with long-range interactions beyond the Mermin-Wagner theorem’s scope. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Information Technology Services; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (A_HKU703/22); Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (17301420, 17301721, 17309822, AoE/P-701/20); K.

Therefore, instead of choosing the proper semiconductor with a specific bandgap energy, hyperdoping technique, which can introduce deep-level dopants and intermediate band into silicon, enable silicon to operate in infrared wavebands. Particularly, the hyperdoped silicon with transition metals, having low ionized impurity scatting, makes silicon a promising infrared detection material. In present work, zinc-hyperdoped silicon is fabricated by femtosecond pulsed laser irradiation. The doping concentration of zinc has exceeded 1019 cm−3, and even reached 1022 cm−3, which is about five orders of magnitude greater than the solid solubility of zinc in crystalline Si. The zinc-hyperdoped silicon shows sub-bandgap absorptance of 87.86 % at 1310 nm. Temperature-dependent Hall effect measurements prove that zinc doping results in acceptor energy level located at 0.520 eV above the valence band maximum. It is worth nothing that, zinc-oxygen related defect state results in donor energy level located at 0.252 eV below the conduction band minimum when lower laser fluence is used, which means the energy level of impurity is altered by the presence of undesignedly doped oxygen atoms, suggesting compound formation between the zinc atoms and oxygen atoms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Hyperdoping; Infrared absorption; Intermediate band; Silicon; Zinc","Atom lasers; Atoms; CMOS integrated circuits; Energy gap; Femtosecond lasers; Irradiation; Light absorption; MOS devices; Oxide semiconductors; Pulsed lasers; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor lasers; Silicon; Zinc; Band gap energy; Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technologies; Conduction type; Femtosecond laser irradiation; Good compatibility; Hyperdoping; Intermediate bands; Low-costs; Oxygen atom; Zinc; Semiconductor doping","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62275098)","The authors would like to acknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant No. # 62275098 .","J.-H.

However, the measured syndrome is in fact a discretized value of the continuous voltage or current values obtained in the physical implementation of the syndrome extraction. In this paper, we use this “soft” or analog information to benefit iterative decoders for decoding quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes. Syndrome-based iterative belief propagation decoders are modified to utilize the soft syndrome to correct both data and syndrome errors simultaneously. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme not only in terms of comparison of thresholds and logical error rates for quasi-cyclic lifted-product QLDPC code families but also with faster convergence of iterative decoders. Additionally, we derive hardware (FPGA) architectures of these soft syndrome decoders and obtain similar performance in terms of error correction to the ideal models even with reduced precision in the soft information. The total latency of the hardware architectures is about 600 ns (for the QLDPC codes considered) in a 20 nm CMOS process FPGA device, and the area overhead is almost constant—less than 50% compared to min-sum decoders with noisy syndromes. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","FPGA devices; Quantum error correction; Syndrome-based decoding","Architecture; Belief propagation; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Iterative decoding; Logic gates; Binary measurements; FPGA devices; Hardware architecture; Iterative decoder; Iterative decodings; LDPC-code; Low-density parity-check codes; Measurements of; Quantum error corrections; Syndrome-based decoding; Error correction","National Quantum Information Science Research Centers; Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems Center, (DE-AC02-07CH11359, PCI2022-132922); National Science Foundation, NSF, (CCF-2100013, CCF-2106189, CCSS-2027844, CCSS-2052751, CIF-1855879, ERC-1941583); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; Office of Science, SC; Center for Selective C-H Functionalization, National Science Foundation; Center for Hierarchical Manufacturing, National Science Foundation, CHM, NSF; European Commission, EC; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033); Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI; QuantERA","This work is generously supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grants: CCF-2100013, CCF-2106189, CCSS-2027844, CCSS-2052751, ERC-1941583, CIF-1855879, NASA under the SURP Program, and by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, National Quantum Information Science Research Centers, Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems Center (SQMS) under the contract No. DE-AC02-07CH11359.

To date all model systems and their diverse realizations across classical and quantum platforms have been local in time, i.e., Markovian. Here we propose a non-Markovian system with anti- PT -symmetry where a single time-delay encodes the retention of memory, and experimentally demonstrate its consequences with two time-delay coupled semiconductor lasers. A transcendental characteristic equation with infinitely many eigenvalue pairs sets our model apart. We show that a sequence of amplifying-to-decaying dominant mode transitions is induced by the time delay in our minimal model. The signatures of these transitions quantitatively match results obtained from four, coupled, nonlinear rate equations for laser dynamics, and are experimentally observed as constant-width sideband oscillations in the laser intensity profiles. Our work introduces a paradigmatic non-Hermitian system with memory, paves the way for its realization in classical systems, and may apply to time-delayed feedback-control for quantum systems. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Feedback control; Nonlinear equations; Quantum optics; Semiconductor lasers; Delay coupled semiconductor lasers; Experimental characterization; Hermitians; Markovian; Modelling systems; Non-Markovian; Paritytime symmetries; Pt  symmetries; Time systems; Time-delays; Time delay","U.S. Department of Defense, DOD; Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-21-1-2630); U.S. Air Force, USAF","Funding text 1: We thank Kaustubh Agarwal for the support in the realization of Fig. .

Traditional machine-learning models struggle with large-scale datasets and complex relationships. This research introduces a novel methodological framework for supply chain backorder prediction, addressing the challenge of collecting large real-world datasets with 90% accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting backorders on short and imbalanced datasets. We capture intricate patterns and dependencies by leveraging quantum-inspired techniques within the quantum-classical neural network QAmplifyNet. Experimental evaluations on a benchmark dataset establish QAmplifyNet’s superiority over eight classical models, three classically stacked quantum ensembles, five quantum neural networks, and a deep reinforcement learning model. Its ability to handle short, imbalanced datasets makes it ideal for supply chain management. We evaluate seven preprocessing techniques, selecting the best one based on logistic regression’s performance on each preprocessed dataset. The model’s interpretability is enhanced using Explainable artificial intelligence techniques. Practical implications include improved inventory control, reduced backorders, and enhanced operational efficiency. QAmplifyNet also achieved the highest F1-score of 94% for predicting “Not Backorder” and 75% for predicting “backorder,” outperforming all other models. It also exhibited the highest AUC-ROC score of 79.85%, further validating its superior predictive capabilities. QAmplifyNet seamlessly integrates into real-world supply chain management systems, empowering proactive decision-making and efficient resource allocation. Future work involves exploring additional quantum-inspired techniques, expanding the dataset, and investigating other supply chain applications. This research unlocks the potential of quantum computing in supply chain optimization and paves the way for further exploration of quantum-inspired machine learning models in supply chain management. Our framework and QAmplifyNet model offer a breakthrough approach to supply chain backorder prediction, offering superior performance and opening new avenues for leveraging quantum-inspired techniques in supply chain management. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; artificial intelligence; decision making; inventory control; learning; machine learning; prediction; receiver operating characteristic; reinforcement (psychology); resource allocation","University of Aizu, UoA","We gratefully acknowledge the support of the Competitive Research Fund of The University of Aizu, Japan, for funding this research.

The burgeoning theoretical understanding coupled with technological advancements have catalyzed research efforts aimed at controlling and manipulating the optical, electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties of materials through the modulation of spin states. Among the myriad of techniques available for investigating these spin-dependent properties, Electron Spin Resonance (ESR), sometimes referred to as electron paramagnetic resonance, stands out as one of the most direct and potent methods to probe electron spin dynamics irrespective of the material environment. ESR furnishes insightful data on the states of individual spins and clusters, spin coherence via relaxation time measurements, and inter-spin distances from spin-spin interaction measurements. Additionally, ESR facilitates the manipulation of spin systems by tailoring the Zeeman energy through the modulation of the external magnetic field, and critically, by the remote manipulation of spins via the application of microwave pulses at resonance frequencies. Modern ESR experimental setups are versatile and can be employed across a wide temperature spectrum—from a few Kelvin, where quantum effects are pronounced, to room temperature and beyond. This adaptability enhances the utility of ESR in investigating the spin-dependent properties in condensed matter systems. Notwithstanding the tremendous potential and advantages that ESR offers, it remains underutilized, especially when compared to inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and nuclear magnetic resonance, despite the latter being more expensive and INS being less accessible. In this review, we elucidate the fundamental principles of ESR, with an emphasis on magnetic and spin interactions in solids, and explore the potential of ESR in advancing the understanding of spin properties across a diverse array of materials science disciplines. We commence with a concise introduction to spin-related physics, followed by the application of ESR in characterizing spin systems. As such, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for a broad audience, ranging from novices to experts, who are keen on unraveling spin phenomena and dynamics in materials science and condensed matter physics. © 2023 Author(s).","","Condensed matter physics; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Electrons; Electrospinning; Magnetic moments; Neutron scattering; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Spin dynamics; Electron-spin resonance; Future perspectives; Generation technologies; Material science; Property; Quantum Computing; Quantum phenomena; Spin systems; Spin-s systems; Versatile tools; Paramagnetic resonance","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CBET-2110603); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-19-1-0363)","This study is partially based upon work supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) under Contract No. FA9550-19-1-0363 and the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. CBET-2110603.

This poses a challenge in predicting stable Fano resonances for realistic applications. Besides, where and when the maximum field enhancement occurs in real acoustic devices remains elusive. In this work, we theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate the existence of a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC in an open acoustic cavity. We provide direct evidence for a QBIC by mapping the pressure field inside the cavity using a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV), which provides the missing field enhancement data. Furthermore, we design a symmetry-reduced BIC and achieve field enhancement by a factor of about three compared to the original cavity. LDV measurements are a promising technique for obtaining high-Q modes’ missing field enhancement data. The presented results facilitate the future applications of BICs in acoustics as high-intensity sound sources, filters, and sensors. © 2023, The Author(s).","","acoustics; coupling; mapping method; pressure field; acoustics; Article; engineering; manufacturing; prediction; refraction index; selective laser sintering; signal noise ratio; simulation; sound detection; sound intensity; three dimensional printing","","","F.

The underlying assumption is that those tasks could be modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs). Here, we investigate the feasibility of this assumption by exploring its consequences for single-qubit quantum state preparation and gate compilation. By forming discrete MDPs, we solve for the optimal policy exactly through policy iteration. We find optimal paths that correspond to the shortest possible sequence of gates to prepare a state or compile a gate, up to some target accuracy. Our method works in both the absence and presence of noise and compares favorably to other quantum compilation methods, such as the Ross–Selinger algorithm.

This has enabled quantum physics to set new standards for the generation of true randomness with significant applications in the fields of cryptography, statistical simulations, and modeling of the nondeterministic behavior in various other fields. In this work, we present a scheme for the generation of multi-bit random numbers using path-entangled single photons. For the experimental demonstration, we generate a path-entangled state using single photons from spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and assign a multi-qubit state for them in path basis. One-bit and two-bit random numbers are then generated by measuring entangled states in the path basis. In addition to passing the NIST tests for randomness, we also demonstrate the certification of quantumness and self-certification of quantum random number generator (QRNG) using Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH) inequality violation. We also record the significantly low autocorrelation coefficient from the raw bits generated and this along with CHSH violation rules out multi-photon events and ensure the protection from photon splitting attack. Distribution of photons along multiple paths resulting in multiple bits from one photon extends the limit on bit generation rate imposed by the detection dead time of the individual detector. Thus, the path-entangled states can generate higher bitrates compared to scheme using entangled photon pair which are limited by the coincidence counts. We demonstrate this by generating a high rate of about 80 Mbps when the single photon detector saturates at around 28 Mcps and still show violation of CHSH inequality. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","Electric equipment protection; Elementary particle sources; Particle beams; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Random number generation; Random processes; Statistical Physics; Entangled state; Multi-bits; Quantum physics; Quantum random number generators; Quantum system; Random Numbers; Simulation and modeling; Single photons; Statistic modeling; Statistical simulation; Photons","","","C.M.

Defense of the nasal mucosal barrier through sIgA is critical to protect from infection and to maintain homeostasis of the microbiome, which influences respiratory disorders and hosts opportunistic pathogens. Methods: We applied IgA-seq analysis to nasal microbiota samples from male and female healthy volunteers, to identify which bacterial genera and species are targeted by sIgA on the level of the individual host. Furthermore, we used nasal sIgA from the same individuals in sIgA deposition experiments to validate the IgA-seq outcomes. Conclusions: We observed that the amount of sIgA secreted into the nasal mucosa by the host varied substantially and was negatively correlated with the bacterial density, suggesting that nasal sIgA limits the overall bacterial capacity to colonize. The interaction between mucosal sIgA antibodies and the nasal microbiota was highly individual with no obvious differences between potentially invasive and non-invasive bacterial species. Importantly, we could show that for the clinically relevant opportunistic pathogen and frequent nasal resident Staphylococcus aureus, sIgA reactivity was in part the result of epitope-independent interaction of sIgA with the antibody-binding protein SpA through binding of sIgA Fab regions. This study thereby offers a first comprehensive insight into the targeting of the nasal microbiota by sIgA antibodies. It thereby helps to better understand the shaping and homeostasis of the nasal microbiome by the host and may guide the development of effective mucosal vaccines against bacterial pathogens.

Four types of interaction energies between the fragments, the deformation energies of metal and dichalcogenolate ions as well as the total interaction and stabilization energies of the complexes were calculated and compared. An energy decomposition analysis (EDA) was also performed to study the nature of metal−bis(dichalcogenolate) bonds in these complexes. The results showed that the stabilization and total interaction energies are decreased by changing the chalcogen atom from sulfur to selenium and from selenium to tellurium ([M(S2C2(CN)2)2]2– > [M(Se2C2(CN)2)2]2– > [M(Te2C2(CN)2)2]2–).

To date, most of the existing quantum repeater protocols are designed based on specific quantum codes or graph states. In this paper, we propose a general framework for all-photonic one-way quantum repeaters based on the measurement-based error correction, which can be adapted to any Calderbank–Shor–Steane code including the recently discovered quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes. We present a decoding scheme, where the error correction process is carried out at the destination based on the accumulated data from the measurements made across the network. This procedure not only outperforms the conventional protocols with independent repeaters but also simplifies the local quantum operations at repeaters. As an example, we numerically show that the [[48, 6, 8]] generalized bicycle code (as a small but efficient QLDPC code) has an equally good performance while reducing the resources by at least an order of magnitude. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Codes (symbols); Quantum communication; Quantum theory; Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes; Decoding scheme; Errors correction; Graph state; Key technologies; Low-density parity-check codes; Measurement-based; Quantum codes; Quantum graph; Quantum repeaters; Error correction","","","H.

The management differs significantly between these two entities, and non-invasive methods that help differentiate between them are eagerly needed to avoid potentially morbid biopsies and surgical procedures. We explore herein the performance and interpretability of an MRI-radiomics variational quantum neural network (QNN) using a quantum-annealing mutual-information (MI) feature selection approach. We retrospectively included 423 patients with HGG and LBM (> 2 cm) who had a contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1) MRI between 2012 and 2019. After exclusion, 72 HGG and 129 LBM were kept. Tumors were manually segmented, and a 5-mm peri-tumoral ring was created. MRI images were pre-processed, and 1813 radiomic features were extracted. A set of best features based on MI was selected. MI and conditional-MI were embedded into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation that was mapped to an Ising-model and submitted to D’Wave’s quantum annealer to solve for the best combination of 10 features. The 10 selected features were embedded into a 2-qubits QNN using PennyLane library. The model was evaluated for balanced-accuracy (bACC) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) on the test set. The model performance was benchmarked against two classical models: dense neural networks (DNN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). Shapley values were calculated to interpret sample-wise predictions on the test set. The best 10-feature combination included 6 tumor and 4 ring features. For QNN, DNN, and XGB, respectively, training ROC-AUC was 0.86, 0.95, and 0.94; test ROC-AUC was 0.76, 0.75, and 0.79; and test bACC was 0.74, 0.73, and 0.72. The two most influential features were tumor Laplacian-of-Gaussian-GLRLM-Entropy and sphericity. We developed an accurate interpretable QNN model with quantum-informed feature selection to differentiate between LBM and HGG on CE-T1 brain MRI. The model performance is comparable to state-of-the-art classical models. © 2023, The Author(s).","Brain metastasis; Glioma; Machine Learning; Quantum annealing; Variational classifier","Area Under Curve; Brain Neoplasms; Glioma; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Retrospective Studies; Annealing; Brain; Feature Selection; Ising model; Noninvasive medical procedures; Pathology; Tumors; Brain metastasis; Contrast-enhanced; Features selection; Glioma; High-grade gliomas; Machine-learning; Quantum annealing; Quantum neural networks; T1-weighted; Variational classifier; area under the curve; artificial neural network; brain tumor; diagnostic imaging; glioma; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures; retrospective study; Magnetic resonance imaging","Saint Joseph University Research Council; Saint Joseph University, USJ, (FS157)","This work was partially funded by the Saint Joseph University Research Council, Grant number: FS157.

Monovacancies are formed using high-energy electron beam irradiation. The ratio of the concentration of negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV−) centers to the total concentration of NV− centers and neutral nitrogen vacancy (NV0) centers decreases with increased concentration of monovacancies. This decrease occurs because of the reduction of the concentration of neutral substitutional nitrogen [Ns0] donating electrons to NV0 centers. Findings indicate that numerous electrons of Ns0 are transferred preferentially to monovacancies, not to NV0 centers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Charge state; Equilibrium equation; Fermi energy; Monovacancy; NV center","Doping (additives); Nitrogen; Single crystals; Charge state; Diamond single crystals; Equilibrium equation; High energy electron beam irradiation; Monovacancies; Negatively charged; Neutral nitrogen; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-doped diamond; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Equations of state","JST Moonshot R&D, (JPMJMS2062); MIC R&D for Construction of a Global Quantum Cryptography Network, (JPMI00316); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (20H05661); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (JPMXS0118067395, JPMXS0118068379); Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, CREST, (JPMJCR1773)","This work was supported by MEXT Q-LEAP ( JPMXS0118068379 and JPMXS0118067395 ).

Chemical design provides atomically precise control of the π-electron cloud, which makes them promising for nanoscale magnetic devices. However, direct verification of their spatially resolved spin-moment remains elusive. Here, we report the spin-polarization of chiral graphene nanoribbons (one-dimensional strips of graphene with alternating zig-zag and arm-chair boundaries), obtained by means of spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy. We extract the energy-dependent spin-moment distribution of spatially extended edge states with π-orbital character, thus beyond localized magnetic moments at radical or defective carbon sites. Guided by mean-field Hubbard calculations, we demonstrate that electron correlations are responsible for the spin-splitting of the electronic structure. Our versatile platform utilizes a ferromagnetic substrate that stabilizes the organic magnetic moments against thermal and quantum fluctuations, while being fully compatible with on-surface synthesis of the rapidly growing class of nanographenes. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","graphene; nanoribbon; carbon; detection method; magnetic property; nanoparticle; polarization; quantum mechanics; Article; chemical parameters; energydependent spin moment distribution; extract; nonhuman; polarization; spin polarization","Aragon Government, (2021-CIEN-000069-01, E12-20R, E13-20R); Basque Department of Education, (PIBA-2020-1-0014, PRE-2021-2-0190); Centro de Investigación, (2019-2022, ED431G2019/03); Gipuzkoa Next; H2020 program, (863098, TED2021-132388B-C43); European Commission, EC; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (PCI2019-111933-2, PID2019-107338RB-C61, PID2019-107338RB-C62, PID2019-107338RB-C63, PID2019-107338RB-C64, PID2020-115406GB-I00, RED2018-102833-T); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (EFA194/16 TNSI); Xunta de Galicia","We acknowledge financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation MICIN through grant nos.

Their primary drawback is the need for precise cavity control (temperature and length), with flexibility issues such as fixed repetition rates and marginally tuneable pulse widths. Targeting a simpler and versatile OPO, we explore the inherent disorder of the refractive index in single-mode fibres realising the first random OPO – the parametric analogous of random lasers. This novel approach uses modulation instability (χ (3) non-linearity) for parametric amplification and Rayleigh scattering for feedback. The pulsed system exhibits high inter-pulse coherence (coherence time of ~0.4 ms), offering adjustable repetition rates (16.6–2000 kHz) and pulse widths (0.69–47.9 ns). Moreover, it operates continuously without temperature control loops, resulting in a robust and flexible device, which would find direct application in LiDAR technology. This work sets the stage for future random OPOs using different parametric amplification mechanisms. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","amplification; optical method; refractive index; scattering; Article; autocorrelation; bandwidth; calculation; controlled study; Fourier transform; light; oscillation; parametric test; quantum optics; refraction index; spectroscopy; stochastic model","OFS-optics; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (06302/DGDND/2020, RGPIN-2020-06302); Canada Research Chairs, (950-231352)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank for the assistance of OFS-optics, specially Paul S.

Typically, semiconductor sections controlled by local gates at the ends of hybrids serve as tunnel barriers. Besides detecting states only at the hybrid ends, such gate-defined tunnel probes can cause the formation of non-topological subgap states that mimic MZMs. Here, we develop an alternative type of tunnel probes to overcome these limitations. After the growth of an InSb-Al hybrid nanowire, a precisely controlled in-situ oxidation of the Al shell is performed to yield a nm-thick AlOx layer. In such thin isolating layer, tunnel probes can be arbitrarily defined at any position along the hybrid nanowire by shadow-wall angle-deposition of metallic leads. In this work, we make multiple tunnel probes along single nanowire hybrids and successfully identify Andreev bound states (ABSs) of various spatial extension residing along the hybrids. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","nanowire; detection method; oxidation; probe; Article; chemical parameters; comparative study; conductance; hybrid; measurement; nonhuman; oxidation; spectroscopy; subgap spectroscopy; supercurrent; surface property; tunnel barrier; tunneling spectroscopy","Microsoft; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","The authors thank Anton R.

Here we investigate a hybrid superconducting–semiconducting Josephson junction subject to microwave irradiation by means of tunnelling spectroscopy of the Andreev bound state spectrum and measurements of the current–phase relation. For increasing microwave power, discrete levels in the tunnelling conductance develop into a series of equally spaced replicas, while the current–phase relation changes amplitude and skewness, and develops dips. Quantitative analysis of our results indicates that conductance replicas originate from photon assisted tunnelling of quasiparticles into Andreev bound states through the tunnelling barrier. Despite strong qualitative similarities with proposed signatures of Floquet–Andreev states, our study rules out this scenario. The distortion of the current–phase relation is explained by the interaction of Andreev bound states with microwave photons, including a non-equilibrium Andreev bound state occupation. The techniques outlined here establish a baseline to study light–matter coupling in hybrid nanostructures and distinguish photon assisted tunnelling from Floquet–Andreev states in mesoscopic devices. © 2023, The Author(s).","","nanomaterial; amplitude; equipment; induced response; irradiation; spectroscopy; spectrum; Article; conductance; controlled study; cross coupling reaction; electric potential; light absorption; microwave irradiation; modulation; molecular beam epitaxy; occupation; photon; quantitative analysis; spectroscopy; surface property","BRNC; Cleanroom Operations Team of the Binnig and Rohrer Nanotechnology Center; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (964398); European Research Council, ERC, (804273); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (425217212, SFB 1432); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (200021_201082); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (PID2020-114880GB-I00)","Funding text 1: We are grateful to C.

However, existing schemes rely on quantum nonlocality and cannot be applied to systems that are not entangled. Here, we introduce a robust method that achieves self-testing of individual systems by taking advantage of contextuality. The scheme is based on the simplest contextuality witness for the simplest contextual quantum system—the Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumovsky inequality for the qutrit. We establish a lower bound on the fidelity of the state and the measurements as a function of the value of the witness under a pragmatic assumption on the measurements. We apply the method in an experiment on a single trapped 40Ca+ using randomly chosen measurements and perfect detection efficiency. Using the observed statistics, we obtain an experimental demonstration of self-testing of a single quantum system. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Quantum communication; Quantum optics; Contextuality; Individual systems; Low bound; Quantum nonlocality; Quantum system; Qutrits; Robust methods; Self-testing; Simple++; Single quantum; Quantum entanglement","DoE ASCR Quantum Testbed Pathfinder program, (DE-SC0019040); DoE QSA; ERA-NET; Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0301200, 2021ZD0301605); NSF Physics Frontier Center, (GBMF-1250002); QuantERA European Research Area Network; Science and Technological Fund of Anhui Province for Outstanding Youth, (2008085J02, US-15097); National Science Foundation, NSF, (OMA-2120757); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-SC0019449); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; Army Research Office, ARO; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; Advanced Scientific Computing Research, ASCR, (DE-SC0020312); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative, MURI, (FA9550-18-1-0161); European Commission, EC; National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11734015, 11821404, 11874345, 11904357, 11904402, 12004430, 12074433, 12174367, 12174447, 12174448); Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS, FNRS, (R.50.05.18); Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER; Fonds pour la Formation à la Recherche dans l’Industrie et dans l’Agriculture, FRIA; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (PCI2019-111885-2); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (PID2020-113738GB-I00); University of Science and Technology of China, USTC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFA0304100, 2021YFE0113100); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province, (2022RC1194)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2017YFA0304100, No. 2021YFE0113100), NSFC (No. 11734015, No. 11874345, No. 11821404, No. 11904357, No. 12174367, No. 11904402, No. 12074433, No. 12174447, No. 12004430, and No. 12174448), Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology (No. 2021ZD0301200, No. 2021ZD0301605), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, the Science and Technology Innovation Program of Hunan Province under Grant (No. 2022RC1194), USTC Tang Scholarship, Science and Technological Fund of Anhui Province for Outstanding Youth (2008085J02).

By connecting two memristive Hindmarsh-Rose (mHR) neurons with one memristor coupling, this paper synthesizes a memristor-coupled mHR neuron (MC-mHRN) network without equilibrium point. For this network, the synchronization condition regulated by the initial condition-offset (ICO) of the memristive channel are derived theoretically, and the ICO-regulating synchronous dynamics is evaluated numerically. Furthermore, the Hamiltonian energy of mHR neuron is studied by Helmholtz's theorem, and the ICO-regulating energy diversity is analyzed numerically. It is demonstrated that the coupling strength and initial condition of the memristive channel can regulate the synchronous dynamics and energy diversity in the MC-mHRN network, thus achieving complete synchronization as well as energy balance. Consequently, the two mHR neurons in hidden chaotic firing modes deliver field energy via memristive channel until the fully synchronized energy balance is achieved. In addition, a digital platform of the MC-mHRN network is fabricated, and the experimental results validate the numerical ones of the synchronous dynamics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Complete synchronization; Energy balance; Hindmarsh-Rose neuron; Initial condition; Memristor; Network","Backpropagation; Dynamics; Memristors; Neural networks; Neurons; Synchronization; Complete synchronization; Coupled networks; Energy diversity; Hindmarsh-Rose neurons; Initial condition offsets; Initial conditions; Memristor; Network; Neuron networks; Synchronous dynamics; Energy balance","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62101478, 62201094); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2023M730937); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018AAA0100800); Guangxi Key Research and Development Program, (BE2018004-04, BK20192004)","This work was supported by the grants from the National Key Research and Development Program under 2018AAA0100800 , the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under 2023M730937 , the National Natural Science Foundation of China under 62201094 and 62101478 , and the Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu under BK20192004 and BE2018004-04 .","X.

Mass and heat transfer heavily rely on the distribution of solids holdups, which are influenced by various operating conditions, including superficial liquid velocities and auxiliary liquid velocities. These operating conditions play a key role in controlling the hydrodynamics of solid distribution. Quantum machine learning (QML)-based modeling techniques are employed to investigate the solids holdup distribution in a Liquid-Solid Circulating Fluidized Bed (LSCFB) system. A novel application of quantum machine learning for the hydrodynamics analysis and modeling of the LSCFB riser. This work aims to lay the groundwork for investigating the applicability of QML for understanding and predicting the hydrodynamic behavior of CFB risers by leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems during the present Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. The unavailability of full-scale quantum infrastructure limits proper exploitation of different quantum computing opportunities including embedding. In this study glass beads particles with 500 µm used as the solid phase and water as liquid phase. At various axial locations (H = 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 3.8 m above the distributor) and with varying superficial liquid velocities, radial nonuniformity of solids holdup is observed. The derived models account for the impact of operating parameters, such as auxiliary and primary liquid velocities and superficial particulate velocity, on the radial phase distribution at various axial positions in the riser. By comparing the predicted solids holdup data with experimental data obtained from a pilot-scale LSCFB reactor, the accuracy of the models is determined. The models exhibit reasonable correlations with the experimental data and consistent phase distribution trends. The correlation coefficients between predicted outputs and experimental data for sequential and nonsequential QML models are 0.95 and 0.96, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Circulating Fluidized Bed; Hydrodynamics; Quantum machine learning; Radial distribution; Solids holdups","Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Heat transfer; Machine learning; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Analysis and models; Circulating fluidized bed; Hydrodynamic analysis; Hydrodynamic modeling; Liquid-solid circulating fluidized beds; Machine-learning; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Radial distributions; Solid holdup; Hydrodynamics","Interdisciplinary Research Center for Refining and Advanced Chemicals; King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, KFUPM; Petroleum Technology Research Centre, PTRC; Western University, UWO","The Interdisciplinary Research Center for Refining and Advanced Chemicals, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia is acknowledged by the authors for providing funding grants and financial assistance for this work under project No. INRC 2318.

Our results are obtained considering restrictions imposed by a real-world fiber grid and using detailed hardware-specific models. By comparing our results to those we would obtain in idealized settings, we show that simplifications lead to a distorted picture of hardware demands, particularly on memory coherence and photon collection. We develop general machinery suitable for studying arbitrary processing-node repeater chains using NetSquid, a discrete-event simulator for quantum networks. This enables us to include time-dependent noise models and simulate repeater protocols with cut-offs, including the required classical control communication. We find minimal hardware requirements by solving an optimization problem using genetic algorithms on a high-performance-computing cluster. Our work provides guidance for further experimental progress, and showcases limitations of studying quantum-repeater requirements in idealized situations. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Cluster computing; Genetic algorithms; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Colour centers; Discrete-event simulators; Memory coherence; Photon collection; Processing nodes; Quantum network; Quantum repeaters; Real-world; Repeater chains; Trapped ion; Trapped ions","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (82044); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (QSC 024.003.037)","We thank Dominik Leichtle and Harold Ollivier for useful discussions on VBQC.

Arguing along the correspondence principle, classical mechanics is often seen as a theory for large systems where quantum coherence is completely averaged out. Surprisingly, it is still possible to reconstruct the coherent dynamics of a quantum bit (qubit) by using a classical model system. This classical-to-quantum analogue is based on wave mechanics, which applies to both, the classical and the quantum world. In this spirit we investigate the dynamics of macroscopic physical pendula with a modulated coupling. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate full control of our one-to-one analogue to a qubit by realizing Rabi oscillations, Landau-Zener transitions and Landau-Zener-Stückelberg-Majorana interferometry.

The determinism arises from a quantum nondemolition measurement of two coupled qubits with the help of readout ancilla, which inevitably requires extra physical qubits. We here demonstrate a deterministic and complete BSM with only a nitrogen atom in a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond as a quantum memory without relying on any carbon isotopes, which are the extra qubits, by exploiting electron‒nitrogen (14N) double qutrits at a zero magnetic field. The degenerate logical qubits within the subspace of qutrits on the electron and nitrogen spins are holonomically controlled by arbitrarily polarized microwave and radiofrequency pulses via zero-field-split states as the ancilla, thus enabling the complete BSM deterministically. Since the system works under an isotope-free and field-free environment, the demonstration paves the way to realize high-fidelity quantum repeaters for long-haul quantum networks and quantum interfaces for large-scale distributed quantum computers. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Nitrogen; Quantum optics; Qubits; Ancilla; Bell-state measurements; Complete Bell-state measurement; Deterministics; Joint measurement; Quantum memory; Quantum nondemolition measurements; Quantum-information systems; Qutrits; Single quantum; Isotopes","JST Moonshot R&D, (JPMJMS2062); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (20H05661, 20K2044120); Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, CREST, (JPMJCR1773); Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, MIC, (JPMI00316)","We thank H.

While far-reaching theoretical predictions have been made for various implementations, direct experimental evidence of their appealing properties can be challenging. Here, we demonstrate optical manipulation of the nuclear spin ensemble in the lead halide perovskite semiconductor FAPbBr3 (FA = formamidinium), targeting a long-postulated collective dark state that is insensitive to optical pumping after its build-up. Via optical orientation of localized hole spins we drive the nuclear many-body system into this entangled state, requiring a weak magnetic field of only a few milli-Tesla strength at cryogenic temperatures. During its fast establishment, the nuclear polarization along the optical axis remains small, while the transverse nuclear spin fluctuations are strongly reduced, corresponding to spin squeezing as evidenced by a strong violation of the generalized nuclear squeezing-inequality with ξs < 0.5. The dark state corresponds to an ~35-body entanglement between the nuclei. Dark nuclear spin states can be exploited to store quantum information benefiting from their long-lived many-body coherence and to perform quantum measurements with a precision beyond the standard limit. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","halide; perovskite; halide; information processing; lead; magnetic field; perovskite; quantum mechanics; acceleration; Article; controlled study; crystal; crystallization; frequency modulation; light absorption; magnetic field; nuclear magnetic resonance; photoluminescence; polarization; qualitative validity","DFG-SNSF, (MK-5158.2021.1.2); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (186406); Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, ETH; Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (21-72-10035); Foundation for the Advancement of Theoretical Physics and Mathematics","We are thankful to M.

A typical example of the fractionalization in quantum spin systems is the spin-1 Haldane state, whose intriguing characteristics are well described by fractionalized virtual spins, delivering two individual spin-1/2 degrees of freedom as edge states. Here we theoretically propose an exotic extension of the Haldane state to the pseudo spin-1 model consisting of the mixture of real spin and spin chirality, resulting in quasi-fractionalization of spin-1/2 magnetization, i.e., an approximately-1/4 spin. Existence of the edge state is confirmed both analytically and numerically in a triangular spin tube, combining a low-energy perturbation theory and variational matrix-product state method. Our study not only proposes an unconventional quantum spin object but paves a way to chop the elementary quantities further. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Perturbation techniques; Quantum theory; Cluster-based; Edge state; Hadron physics; Haldane; Quantum spin systems; Quark model; Spin 1/2; Spin-charge separation; Strongly correlated electron system; Triangular spin tubes; Chirality","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (JPMXS0118067394, JPMXS0120319794)","This work was partly supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (Grant No. 16K17753), Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (Grant No. 20K03840), and MEXT Quantum Leap Flagship Program (MEXT QLEAP) Grant No. JPMXS0118067394 and JPMXS0120319794.

In the past 60 years they have become an essential analysis tool on classical computers in various fields. The recent finding that copulas can be expressed as maximally entangled quantum states has revealed a promising approach to practical quantum advantages: performing tasks faster, requiring less memory, or, as we show, yielding better predictions. Studying the scalability of this quantum approach as both the precision and the number of modeled variables increase is crucial for its adoption in real-world applications. In this paper, we successfully apply a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) based approach to modeling 3- and 4-variable copulas on trapped ion quantum computers. We study the training of QCBMs with different levels of precision and circuit design on a simulator and a state-of-the-art trapped ion quantum computer. We observe decreased training efficacy due to the increased complexity in parameter optimization as the models scale up. To address this challenge, we introduce an annealing-inspired strategy that dramatically improves the training results. In our end-to-end tests, various configurations of the quantum models make a comparable or better prediction in risk aggregation tasks than the standard classical models. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","GE Research","A.G., W.S., S.R.M. and B.N. would like to thank Dave Vernooy for supporting quantum research—computing, networking and sensing—at GE Research.","D.

Crystallographic characterization unambiguously confirmed that Th and Y or Dy are encapsulated inside variably sized fullerene carbon cages. The ESR study of ThY@D 3h(5)-C78 shows a doublet as expected for an unpaired electron interacting with Y, and a SQUID magnetometric study of ThDy@D 3h(5)-C78 reveals a high-spin ground state for the whole molecule. Theoretical studies further confirm the presence of a single-electron bonding interaction between Y or Dy and Th, due to a significant overlap between hybrid spd orbitals of the two metals. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","carbon; dysprosium; fullerene derivative; thorium; yttrium; chemical bonding; chemical compound; electron; fullerene; molecular analysis; Article; chemical bond; chemical structure; computer model; crystallography; electrochemical analysis; electron; reduction (chemistry); spectroscopy; SQUID magnetometry; structure analysis; synthesis; valence (chemistry); X ray diffraction","NSF of Jiangsu Province, (BK20200041); URV; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CHE-1801317); Welch Foundation, (AH-0033); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (22301288, 52172051, 91961109); Generalitat de Catalunya, (2021SGR00110); Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca, AGAUR; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province, (2308085MB31); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (PID2020-112762GB-I00, PID2020-113187GB-I00); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (WK2060000051); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, PAPD","Funding text 1: N.

The dc voltage induce the Josephson current with oscillation frequency [Formula presented]. The time-dependent Landauer-like formula and linear dc photonic heat conductance formula are derived. The application of Majorana fermions suppresses the amplitude, and splits the resonant peaks of heat current. The heat conductance is suppressed with increasing the coupling constants of Majorana fermions. With the coupling of Majorana fermions, the magnitude of heat conductance is enhanced with the increase of ω/Ω0, and it is suppressed due to increasing the magnitude of applied ac flux.

One remarkable achievement in this direction is dynamical decoupling (DD), although its applicability remains limited because fast control is required. Using resource theoretic tools, we show that non-Markovianity is a resource for noise reduction, raising the possibility that it can be leveraged for noise reduction where traditional DD methods fail. We propose a non-Markovian optimisation technique for finding DD pulses. Using a prototypical noise model, we numerically demonstrate that our optimisation-based methods are capable of drastically improving the exploitation of temporal correlations, extending the timescales at which noise suppression is viable by at least two orders of magnitude, compared to traditional DD which does not use any knowledge of the non-Markovian environment. Importantly, the corresponding tools are built on operational grounds and can be easily implemented to reduce noise in the current generation of quantum devices. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Decoupling methods; Dynamical decoupling; Dynamical decoupling pulse; Fast control; Mitigation methods; Noise mitigation; Noise reduction methods; Non-Markovian; Optimization techniques; Resources consumption; Noise abatement","EU Agency; Fetzer Franklin Fund; Silicon Valley Community Foundation, SVCF; Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL; Foundational Questions Institute, FQxI; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (801110); Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP210100597, FT160100073); National Research Foundation, NRF; Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR, (NRF2021-QEP2-02-P06); Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE, (FQXi-RFP-IPW-1903, RG146/20); Bundesministerium für Bildung, Wissenschaft, Forschung und Technologie, BMBWF; Bundesministerium für Bildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung, BMBWF","Funding text 1: G.

The model explicitly considers the key ingredients of well-known Majorana hybrid nanowire setups: Rashba spin-orbit coupling, magnetic field perpendicular to the nanoribbon plane, and first nearest neighbor hopping with p-wave superconducting pairing. The energy spectrum of the system, as a function of chemical potential, reveals the existence of MZMs with a well-defined spin orientation localized at the opposite ends of both the top and bottom chains of the p-SiNR, associated with well-localized and nonoverlapping wave function profiles. Well-established experimental techniques enable the fabrication of highly ordered p-SiNRs, complemented by a thin lead film on top, responsible for inducing p-wave superconductivity through proximity effect. Moreover, the emergence of MZMs with explicit opposite spin orientations for some set of model parameters opens a new avenue for exploring quantum computing operations, which accounts for both MZMs and spin properties, as well as for new MZMs probe devices based on spin-polarized electronic transport mechanisms. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Icelandic Centre for Research, RANNIS, (163082-051); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (305810/2020-0, 308695/2021-6, 311980/2021-0); Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, FAPERJ, (210 355/2018, 211.605/2021, E-26/201.223/2021)","M.S.F., M.A.C., and A.C.S. acknowledge financial support from the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) grant numbers 311980/2021-0, 305810/2020-0, 308695/2021-6, respectively.

However, the consideration of multiple factors may exacerbate model complexity, resulting in longer solution times and compromising the strategy's practicality. With the remarkable potential power of quantum computing (QC), we propose a hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) approach for this problem. A HQC-based framework is proposed and the CPR model is established considering repair crew dispatch, PDS operation, microgrids operation, and topology reconfiguration. Then, a hybrid quantum-classical Benders decomposition (HQC-BD) algorithm and detailed pseudocode are proposed and presented in compact form. The integer slack and binary expansion methods are applied to transform the constrained problem into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. Finally, the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed HQC-BD approach are verified. The comparative analysis of different calculation methods is conducted by employing the D-Wave's direct quantum processing unit solvers and hybrid solvers via the Leap™ quantum cloud service. This paper explores the possibility of quantum-accelerated resilience restoration and enhancement from the HQC point of view. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Benders decomposition; Hybrid quantum-classical approach; Post-disaster restoration; Power distribution system; Quantum annealing; Resilience","Computational efficiency; Constrained optimization; Electric load dispatching; Electric power distribution; Integer programming; Quantum computers; Stochastic programming; Topology; Benders' decompositions; Classical approach; Hybrid quantum-classical approach; Post-disaster restorations; Power-distribution system; Quantum annealing; Quantum-classical; Resilience; Restoration strategies; Urban distribution systems; algorithm; decomposition analysis; distribution system; optimization; quantum mechanics; urban area; Restoration","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52307134); Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province, (2023-JC-QN-0480)","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52307134 ) and Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi (Program No. 2023-JC-QN-0480) ","H.

The present study aimed to investigate whether Velusetrag, a selective 5‑HT4 receptor agonist, may be a suitable candidate to improve intestinal motility in a mouse model of PD. Five months old PrP human A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic (Tg) mice, which display severe constipation along with decreased colonic cholinergic transmission already at 3 months, were treated daily with the drug for 4 weeks. Velusetrag treatment reduced constipation by significantly stimulating both the longitudinal and circular-driven contractions and improved inflammation by reducing the level of serum and colonic IL1β and TNF-α and by decreasing the number of GFAP-positive glia cells in the colon of treated mice. No significant downregulation of the 5-HT4 receptor was observed but instead Velusetrag seemed to improve axonal degeneration in Tgs as shown by an increase in NF-H and VAChT staining. Ultimately, Velusetrag restored a well-balanced intestinal microbial composition comparable to non-Tg mice. Based on these promising data, we are confident that Velusetrag is potentially eligible for clinical studies to treat constipation in PD patients. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","choline acetyltransferase; glial fibrillary acidic protein; interleukin 1beta; tumor necrosis factor; velusetrag; vesicular acetylcholine transporter; Actinobacteria; Akt signaling; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; Bacteroidaceae; body weight; cholinergic nerve cell; colitis; colon motility; constipation; controlled study; down regulation; dysbiosis; enteritis; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Erysipelotrichaceae; feces analysis; female; Firmicutes; gait; immunohistochemistry; intestine flora; intestine motility; Lachnospiraceae; male; microbial community; microbiome; mouse; nerve fiber degeneration; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; Ruminococcaceae; sequence alignment; Verrucomicrobia; Western blotting","Alfasigma and Scuola Normale Superiore","The authors thank Dr. Elena Novelli for the excellent microscope training.

The nanodiamond (ND) hosting nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers will be a promising EPR sensor to achieve this goal. However, ND-based EPR spectroscopy remains elusive, due to the challenge of controlling NV centers without well-defined orientations inside a flexible ND. Here, we show a generalized zero-field EPR technique with spectra robust to the sensor’s orientation. The key is applying an amplitude modulation on the control field, which generates a series of equidistant Floquet states with energy splitting being the orientation-independent modulation frequency.

They are parity protected, which enhances their lifetime, but makes it more difficult to excite them. Here, we realize the excitation of YSR states by microwaves facilitated by the tunnel coupling to another superconducting electrode in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). We identify the excitation process through a family of anomalous microwave-assisted tunneling peaks originating from a second-order resonant Andreev process, in which the microwave excites the YSR state triggering a tunneling event transferring a total of two charges. We vary the amplitude and the frequency of the microwave to identify the energy threshold and the evolution of this excitation process. Our work sets an experimental basis and proof-of-principle for the manipulation of YSR states using microwaves with an outlook towards YSR qubits. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","amplitude; electrode; microwave radiation; superconductivity; tunneling; Article; conductance; electric potential; electron spin resonance; energy transfer; excitation; lifespan; microwave irradiation; microwave radiation; parity","European Research Council, ERC, (681164); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (SFB 1432); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (PID2020-114880GB-I00)","The authors thank Klaus Kern for fruitful discussions.

However, definitive experimental evidence remains elusive. In light of the recent surge in theoretical and experimental interest in the half-filled Hubbard model on a triangular lattice, which offers the potential for stabilizing a chiral QSL, we investigate the electromagnetic signatures of this phase to facilitate experimental detection. Utilizing a combination of parton mean-field theory and unbiased density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we systematically examine the electrical charge and orbital electrical current associated with a spinon excitation in the chiral QSL. Additionally, we calculate the longitudinal and transverse optical conductivities below the Mott gap. Furthermore, employing quantum field theory analysis, we unravel the connection between spinon excitations and emergent as well as physical gauge fields. Our results demonstrate that the chiral QSL phase exhibits a distinct electromagnetic response, even within a Mott insulator regime. This finding holds great potential for enabling the experimental detection of this long-sought-after phase. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Vivien Zapf, (89233218CNA000001); Office of Science, SC, (2018BU0010, 2018BU0083, 2022SDXHDX0005); Westlake University; Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province, (2021C01002); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFA1402200)","Funding text 1: The authors thank Vivien Zapf and S.

The conductance and dot occupancies are calculated at finite temperatures. The density of states of the carbon nanotube leads is observed to play a significant role in determining the conductance profile. In particular, whenever the chemical potential of the isolated double quantum dot system is aligned with the position of a van-Hove singularity in the density of states of armchair carbon nanotube leads, the height of the corresponding conductance peak falls considerably.

We investigate the impact of the initial even coherent amplitude, the atom–photon coupling strengths, and the atomic motion coupling on the dynamics of quantum memory (QM) entropic uncertainty and entanglement. The dynamics of the entropic uncertainty and entanglement of formation are significantly altered by the atom-photon-atom interaction parameters. By increasing the initial mean photon number, the QM entropic uncertainty and the atomic entanglement can be improved. Bob's capacity to limit his uncertainty regarding Alice's measurement results depends on the initial even coherent state, the atom–photon couplings, and the atomic motion parameter. The atomic location couplings produce QM entropic uncertainty and entanglement with regular oscillatory behavior. The system parameters control the sudden death-birth entanglement phenomenon, which is improved by increasing the atomic location coupling. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Atomic motion; Entanglement of formation; Entropic uncertainty; Quantum memory","Couplings; Dynamics; Photons; Quantum entanglement; Uncertainty analysis; Atomic entanglement; Atomic locations; Atomic motion; Entanglement dynamics; Entanglement of formation; Entropic uncertainty; Moving atom; Quantum memory; Uncertainty; Uncertainty relation; Atoms","Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, PSAU, (PSAU/2023/R/1444)","The authors are very grateful to the referees for their important remarks which improve the manuscript.

In this paper, we lift the constraint and derive a previously unknown quantum Cramér-Rao bound. We find that the new bound can reach arbitrary small value with mixed states and it breaks the Heisenberg limit in some cases. We construct a setup to measure non-Hermitian operators and discuss the saturation of the present bound.

In order to gain a clearer understanding of this intricate relation, this study presents a comprehensive classification scheme for the SHG effect in magnetically ordered materials. This framework offers a straightforward approach to connecting magnetic order and the SHG effect. The characteristics of the SHG tensors in all magnetic point groups are studied using the isomorphic group method, followed by a comprehensive SHG effect classification scheme that includes seven types based on the symmetries of the magnetic phases and their corresponding parent phases. In addition, a tensor dictionary containing the SHG and linear magneto-optic (LMO) effect is established. Furthermore, an extensive SHG database of magnetically ordered materials is also built up. This classification strategy exposes an anomalous SHG effect with even characteristics (i.e., invariant) under time-reversal symmetry, which is solely contributed by magnetic structure. Moreover, the proposed classification scheme facilitates the determination of magnetic structures through the SHG effect. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Chong Wang; Shandong University, SDU; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11904001, 11947212, 12204003, 12204009); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (U1932156); Xi’an Jiaotong University, XJTU; Anhui University; Hunan University, HNU; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province, (2008085QA29, 2208085QA08); Tsinghua University, THU; Anhui University of Science and Technology, AUST; China Medical University, CMU; University of Science and Technology of China, USTC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFA1403700)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the High-performance Computing Platform of Anhui University for providing computing resources.

As a noteworthy example, in O(n) systems the statistical mechanics underlying such forces can be shown to differ in the constant M→ magnetic canonical ensemble (CE) from those in the widely-studied constant h→ grand canonical ensemble (GCE). Here, the counterpart of the Casimir force in the GCE is the Helmholtz force in the CE. Given the difference between the two ensembles for finite systems, it is reasonable to anticipate that these forces will have, in general, different behavior for the same geometry and boundary conditions. Here we present some exact results for both the Casimir and the Helmholtz force in the case of the one-dimensional Ising model subject to periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions and compare their behavior. We note that the Ising model has recently being solved in Phys.Rev. E 106 L042103 (2022), using a combinatorial approach, for the case of fixed value M of its order parameter. Here we derive exact result for the partition function of the one-dimensional Ising model of N spins and fixed value M using the transfer matrix method (TMM); earlier results obtained via the TMM were limited to M=0 and N even. As a byproduct, we derive several specific integral representations of the hypergeometric function of Gauss. Using those results, we rigorously derive that the free energies of the CE and grand GCE are related to each other via Legendre transformation in the thermodynamic limit, and establish the leading finite-size corrections for the canonical case, which turn out to be much more pronounced than the corresponding ones in the case of the GCE. © 2023 The Author(s)","Critical Casimir and Helmholtz forces; Critical phenomena; Exact results; Finite-size scaling; Phase transitions; Thermodynamic ensembles","","European Commission, EC, (D01-229/27.10.2021); Ministry of Education and Science, MES","DD acknowledges the financial support by Grant No BG05M2OP001-1.002-0011-C02 financed by OP SESG 2014–2020 and by the EU through the ESIFs.

For precision sensing applications, densely packed NV− centers within a small volume are preferable due to benefiting from 1/√N sensitivity enhancement (N is the number of sensing NV centers) and efficient excitation of NV centers. However, methods for quickly and efficiently forming high concentrations of NV− centers are in the development stage. We report an efficient method for creating high-density NV− centers production from a relatively low nitrogen concentration based on high-energy photons generated from Ar+ plasma source. This study was done on type-IIa, single crystal, chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown diamond substrates with an as-grown nitrogen concentration of 1 × 1017 cm−3. We created high NV− density (∼20,000 NVs over the diffraction limited sample volume) distributed homogeneously over 150–200 μm deep from the diamond surface. The plasma-created NV−s in CVD diamond have a spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) of 5 ms and a spin-spin coherence time (T2) of 4 μs. We measure a DC magnetic field sensitivity of ∼104 nT Hz-1/2, an AC magnetic field sensitivity of ∼0.12 pT Hz-1/2 and demonstrate real-time magnetic field sensing at a rate over 10 mT s−1 using the diffraction limited sample volume. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Diamond; Magnetometry; Nitrogen; Nitrogen vacancy center; Quantum sensing","Chemical vapor deposition; Diamonds; Diffraction; Magnetic fields; Magnetometers; Magnetometry; Magnetoplasma; Nitrogen plasma; Single crystals; Chemical vapor deposition diamond; Diffraction limited; Magnetic field sensitivity; Nitrogen concentrations; Nitrogen vacancies; Nitrogen-vacancy center; NV center; Quantum sensing; Sample volume; Sensing applications; Nitrogen","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2025298, 2328822, OIA-2044049)","K.A. would like to acknowledge the support of the National Science Foundation/EPSCoR RII Track-4 Award OIA-2033210 and NSF Award 2328822.

Toward physical QRAM implementations, Chen et al. (2021) recently showed that QRAM maps natively onto optically connected quantum networks with O(log(N)) overhead and built-in error detection. However, modeling QRAM on large networks has been stymied by exponentially rising classical compute requirements. Here, we address this bottleneck by: (1) introducing a resource-efficient method for simulating large-scale noisy entanglement, allowing us to evaluate hundreds and even thousands of qubits under various noise channels; and (2) analyzing Chen et al.’s network-based QRAM as an application at the scale of quantum data centers or near-term quantum internet; and (3) introducing a modified network-based QRAM architecture to improve quantum fidelity and access rate. We conclude that network-based QRAM could be built with existing or near-term technologies leveraging photonic integrated circuits and atomic or atom-like quantum memories. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Network architecture; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Random access storage; Timing circuits; Arbitrary superposition; Efficient simulation; Memory cell; Memory optimization; Network-based; Quantum applications; Quantum circuit; Quantum memory; Random access memory; Resource-efficient; Memory architecture","NSF C-Accel program, (2040695); National Science Foundation, NSF, (1941583); Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF2110325); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (2021.03707, BD/05268/2021, CEECIND/CP1653/CT0002, EPiQ ANR-22-PETQ-0007, UIDB/04540/2020, UIDB/50008/2020)","L.B., E.Z.C., and Y.O. thank the support from Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT, Portugal), namely through projects UIDB/04540/2020 and UIDB/50008/2020.

While experimental observations have confirmed the existence of discrete or continuous time crystals, these realizations have relied on the utilization of periodic forces or effective modulation through cavity feedback. The original proposal for time crystals is that they would represent self-sustained motions without any external periodicity, but realizing such purely self-generated behavior has not yet been achieved. Here, we provide theoretical and experimental evidence that many-body interactions can give rise to an inherent time crystalline phase. Following a calculation that shows an ensemble of pumped four-level atoms can spontaneously break continuous time translation symmetry, we observe periodic motions in an erbium-doped solid. The inherent time crystal produced by our experiment is self-protected by many-body interactions and has a measured coherence time beyond that of individual erbium ions. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","asymmetry; cavity; crystal structure; experimental study","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12174026, 62105033)","The authors would like to thank Zhang-Qi Yin for helpful discussions.

To maximise performance, these sources normally operate at liquid helium temperatures ( ∼ 4 K ), introducing significant size, weight and power requirements that can be impractical for proposed applications. Here we experimentally resolve the two distinct temperature-dependent phonon interactions that degrade indistinguishability, allowing us to demonstrate that coupling to a photonic nanocavity can greatly improve photon coherence at elevated temperatures up to 30 K that are compatible with compact cryocoolers. We derive a polaron model that fully captures the temperature-dependent influence of phonons observed in our experiments, providing predictive power to further increase the indistinguishability and operating temperature of future devices through optimised cavity parameters. © 2023 The Author(s).

Exploiting these ideas in solid-state systems has lead to circuit QED which has emerged as a valuable tool to explore the rich physics of quantum optics and as a platform for quantum computation. Here we introduce a simple approach to further engineer the light-matter interaction in a driven cavity by controllably decoupling a qubit from the cavity’s photon population, effectively cloaking the qubit from the cavity. This is realized by driving the qubit with an external tone tailored to destructively interfere with the cavity field, leaving the qubit to interact with a cavity which appears to be in the vacuum state. Our experiment demonstrates how qubit cloaking can be exploited to cancel the ac-Stark shift and measurement-induced dephasing, and to accelerate qubit readout. In addition to qubit readout, applications of this method include qubit logical operations and the preparation of non-classical cavity states in circuit QED and other cavity-based setups. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","quantum dot; cavity; electrodynamics; electromagnetic field; experimental study; quantum mechanics; absorption spectroscopy; Article; chemical interaction; excitation; interferometry; light; measurement error; microwave radiation; oscillation; photon; quantum chemistry; steady state; vacuum","ANR-21-CE47-0007; Ministère de l’Économie et de l’Innovation du Québec, (ANR-22-PETQ-0006); Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-18-1-0411); Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, IARPA; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to Élie Genois for helpful discussions and to Lincoln Labs and IARPA from providing the TWPA.

Blockchain technology is introduced and further improved to address security problems such as information leakage in PRS. A Delegated Proof of Stake-Byzantine Algorand-Directed Acyclic Graph consensus algorithm, namely PBDAG consensus algorithm, is designed for public chains. Finally, a personalized recommendation model based on the hybrid blockchain PBDAG consensus algorithm combined with an optimized back propagation algorithm is constructed. Through simulation, the performance of this model is compared with practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Hybrid Parallel Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Redundant Byzantine Fault Tolerance, and Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance. The results show that the model algorithm adopted here has a lower average delay time, a data message delivery rate that is stable at 80%, a data message leakage rate that is stable at about 10%, and a system classification prediction error that does not exceed 10%. Therefore, the constructed model not only ensures low delay performance but also has high network security performance, enabling more efficient and accurate interaction of information. This solution provides an experimental basis for the information security and development trend of different types of data PRSs in various fields. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; back propagation; blockchain; consensus; controlled study; deep learning; directed acyclic graph; information security; network security; prediction error; simulation","Guangxi Education and Science Annual, (2023A028); Guangxi Education and Science special project of college innovation and entrepreneurship education, (2022ZJY2727); Guangxi University—Smart Logistics Industry School Construction Project; Middle-aged and Young Teachers’ Basic Ability of Scientific Research Promotion Project of Guangxi, (2021KY0130); Research Project of China Society of Logistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing; Nanjing Normal University, NNU; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62066032); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (202102079139); Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province, (2021GXNSFAA075019); Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (21FYJ041)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.62066032); Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province (No.2021GXNSFAA075019); The “14th Five Year Plan” of Guangxi Education and Science special project of college innovation and entrepreneurship education (No.2022ZJY2727); The “14th Five Year Plan” of Guangxi Education and Science Annual project (No.2023A028); Middle-aged and Young Teachers’ Basic Ability of Scientific Research Promotion Project of Guangxi (No.2021KY0130); Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Guangxi (No.21FYJ041); Research Project of China Society of Logistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (No.2023CSLKT3-183).

For many applications, it would be of great advantage to have more than one metastable particle-like texture available. The coexistence of skyrmions and antiskyrmions has been proposed in inversion-symmetric magnets with exchange frustration. However, so far only model systems have been studied and the lifetime of coexisting metastable topological spin structures has not been obtained. Here, we predict that skyrmions and antiskyrmions with diameters below 10 nm can coexist at zero magnetic field in a Rh/Co bilayer on the Ir(111) surface—an experimentally feasible system. We show that the lifetimes of metastable skyrmions and antiskyrmions in the ferromagnetic ground state are above one hour for temperatures up to 75 and 48 K, respectively. The entropic contribution to the nucleation and annihilation rates differs for skyrmions and antiskyrmions. This opens the route to the thermally activated creation of coexisting skyrmions and antiskyrmions in frustrated magnets with Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","University of Iceland Research Fund, (15673); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (462602351, 523127890, SPP2137); Icelandic Centre for Research, RANNIS, (217750); Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2020-05110)","We thank Hendrik Schrautzer and Tim Drevelow for valuable discussions.

Ideal quantum repeater nodes efficiently link a quantum memory with photons serving as flying qubits. Color centers in diamond, particularly the negatively charged silicon vacancy center, are promising candidates to establish such nodes. Inefficient connection between the color center’s spin to the optical fiber networks is a major obstacle, that could be resolved by utilizing optical resonators. Here, we couple individual silicon vacancy centers incorporated in a nanodiamond to a hemispherical, stable Fabry-Perot microcavity, achieving Purcell-factors larger than 1. We demonstrate coherent optical driving between ground and excited state with a Rabi-frequency of 330 MHz, all-optical initialization and readout of the electron spin in magnetic fields of up to 3.2 T. Spin initialization within 67 ns with a 80 % fidelity and a lifetime of 350 ns are reached.

The characterization of the AgNPs was carried out using UV–Vis spectroscopy, FTIR, DLS and TEM. Resazurin microtiter-plate assay was used to determine the antimicrobial action of AgNPs against Escherichia coli. UV–Visible spectra showed peaks between 414 and 460 nm. TEM analysis revealed that the synthesized AgNPs showed mostly spherical shapes. DLS results determined sizes from 20.8 to 118.4 nm. The highest antimicrobial activity was obtained with the AgNPs synthesized with supernatant rather than those using the intracellular extract. Therefore, it was determined that the bacterial species, temperature, pH, and type of extract (supernatant or intracellular) influence the biosynthesis. This synthesis thus offers a simple, environmentally friendly, and low-cost method for the production of AgNPs, which can be used as antibacterial agents. © 2023 The Author(s)","Antimicrobial effect; Bacterial extracts; Biosynthesis; Characterization; Silver nanoparticles","bacterial extract; kanamycin; silver nanoparticle; antimicrobial activity; Article; Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; bacterial growth; bacterium culture; biosynthesis; Cupriavidus necator; dispersity; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; green synthesis; microtiter plate assay; minimum inhibitory concentration; particle size; pH; photon correlation spectroscopy; process optimization; resazurin assay; synthesis; temperature; transmission electron microscopy; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; zeta potential","Centro Nacional de Alta Tecnología; Laboratório Nacional de Nanotecnologia, LNN","The authors would like to express their thanks for the financial support provided by Laboratorio Nacional de Nanotecnología (LANOTEC), Centro Nacional de Alta Tecnología (CeNAT-CONARE).

In the first family, the presence of a deprotonated orthovanillin ligand (ovan) around the Ln ion positioned in the outer coordination site of the main ligand allows a good isolation of the dinuclear complexes. These complexes behave as SMSs when a Dy ion is coordinated in the outer site but a weak magnetic magnetic Ln-Dy interaction is needed to create a weak magnetic field able to suppress collapsing of the hysteresis loops in zero external applied field at very low temperature. In the second family, the ovan ligand is replaced by a chloride ligand, so that two dinuclear units are linked together by two Cl…HOMe hydrogen bonds to yield tetranuclear complexes that are not SMMs. Eventually these two preparation pathways are expected to give novel and genuine examples of homo or hetero-dinuclear and tetranuclear lanthanide complexes likely to furnish in future coordination complexes useful in quantum computing. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Coordination chemistry; Crystal structures; Heterodi- or tetranuclear complexes; Lanthanide; Magnetic data","","Sixth Framework Programme, FP6, (NMP3-CT-2005-515767)","The authors are grateful to J.-F.

This will eventually lead to faster and more efficient calculations especially when we deal with complex problems. However, there is a downside related to this hardware revolution since the security of widely used cryptographic schemes, e.g., RSA encryption scheme, relies on the hardness of certain mathematical problems that are known to be solved efficiently by quantum computers, i.e., making these protocols insecure. As such, while quantum computers most likely will not be available any time in the near future, it's necessary to create alternative solutions before quantum computers become a reality. This paper therefore provides a comprehensive review of attacks and countermeasures in Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) to portray a roadmap of PQC standardization, currently led by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). More specifically, there has been a rise in the side-channel attacks against PQC schemes while the NIST standardization process is moving forward. We therefore focus on the side-channel attacks and countermeasures in major post-quantum cryptographic schemes, i.e., the final NIST candidates. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Attacks on PQC; Post-quantum cryptography; PQC standardization; Quantum-resistant algorithms; Side-channel attacks","Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Side channel attack; Attack on post-quantum cryptography; National Institute of Standards and Technology; Post quantum cryptography; Post-quantum cryptography standardization; Quanta computers; Quantum-resistant algorithm; Roadmap; Side-channel attacks; Standardization","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS-1801341)","We thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback.

We observed exotic multi-site MZMs located near the junction center, on the nearby edge sites of each leg.

Furthermore, we study the stability of local (single-site) and multi-site MZMs modes in the presence of Coulomb repulsion, using density matrix renormalization group theory.

The aim of the study was to uncover whether a history of periodontitis would influence microbiome colonization on the TAD surface. Results: Patients were grouped by periodontal evaluations before the orthodontic treatment. Patients with healthy periodontal conditions were classified as the healthy group, and patients diagnosed with periodontitis stage II or even worse were classified as the periodontitis group. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the existence of biofilm on the surface of 4 TADs from the healthy group and 4 TADs from the periodontitis group. Fifteen TADs from the healthy group and 12 TADs from the periodontitis group were collected. The microorganisms on the surface of TADs were harvested and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. α-diversity indices and β-diversity indices were calculated. Wilcoxon’s test was used to determine differences between genera, species as well as KEGG functions. SEM analysis revealed bacteria colonization on the surface of TADs from both groups. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on β diversity revealed differential sample clusters depending on periodontal conditions (P < 0.01).

Previous research has been largely confined to impractical liquid cryogen cooling and the few under-reported examples of implementing electric cryocoolers. This study further clarifies the operation of cryo-CMOS devices cooled by electric cryocoolers. It develops and experimentally validates an analytical relation between the junction temperature and the parameters of a cryogenic system. To validate this relationship, we placed a printed circuit board in a thermal chamber, cooled it to 173 K using a Stirling cryocooler, and varied input clock frequencies. The measured values of the junction temperature were compared with calculations, which showed good prediction accuracy with a coefficient of variance of ±2%, a mean biased error of −2%, and a determination coefficient of 0.92. In addition, the measurements provided evidence for a multi-fold increase in the clock frequency of cryo-CMOS electronics. The results of this study help estimate accurately the steady-state junction temperature of cryo-CMOS devices in a wide range of cryogenic temperatures for different types of cryocoolers. © 2023 The Author(s)","CMOS electronics; Cryo-CMOS; Junction temperature; Stirling cryocooler; Superconducting electronics","Clocks; CMOS integrated circuits; Cooling; Cryogenic equipment; Printed circuit boards; Analytical relations; Case-studies; Clock frequency; CMOS devices; CMOS electronic; Cryo-CMOS; Cryocoolers; Junction temperatures; Stirling cryocoolers; Superconducting electronics; Junction temperature","","","D.

A potential strategy is to replace traditional fuels with clean and green choices and upgrade engine performance. This research paper introduces a newly developed hybrid integrated marine engine involving a gas turbine, a solid oxide fuel cell, and two organic Rankine cycles. This potential engine is then analyzed using exergy, exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental analyses and assessments. It is found that the engine combination can produce 15.8 MW, which is increased by 50% compared to a traditional marine engine, and the engine performance reaches 38% energetic efficiency and 47% exergetic efficiency. Also, the exergetic efficiency based on the fuel and product principle is 54 %. This engine has a 243 $/h levelized cost rate and a 132 mPt/h environmental rate. Finally, the average overall specific product exergetic cost and specifc product-based environmental impact are obtained to be 60 $/GJ and 20 mPt/MJ, respectively. By comparing five potential fuel blends (namely MF1 with 25% hydrogen and 75% methane, MF2: 25% hydrogen and 75% methanol, MF3: 40% hydrogen and 60 % ethanol, MF4: 40% hydrogen and 60% DME, and MF5: 40% hydrogen, 15% methanol, 15% methane, 15% DME and 15% ethanol), the blend of methane and hydrogen with marine fuel (MF1) is found to be the most economical with the lowest environmental impact while the second option is the ethanol and hydrogen blend (e.g., MF3). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative fuels; Exergoeconomic analysis; Exergoenvironmental analysis; Exergy; Hydrogen; Solid oxide fuel cell","Efficiency; Environmental impact; Ethanol; Exergy; Fossil fuels; Marine engines; Methane; Methanol; Rankine cycle; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Eco-friendly; Engine performance; Exergetic efficiency; Exergoeconomic analysis; Exergoeconomics; Exergoenvironmental analyse; Fuel blends; Maritime vessels; Solid-oxide fuel cell; Traditional fuels; Alternative fuels","Research and Development; Transport Canada, TC; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by Transport Canada through its Clean Transportation Program - Research and Development and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).","S.

This efficiency can be optimized by transferring spintronics to the atomic scale. We present electric control of spin resonance transitions in single TiH molecules by employing electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy (ESR-STM). We find strong bias voltage dependent shifts in the ESR signal of about ten times its line width. We attribute this to the electric field in the tunnel junction, which induces a displacement of the spin system changing the g-factor and the effective magnetic field of the tip. We demonstrate direct electric control of the spin transitions in coupled TiH dimers. Our findings open up new avenues for fast coherent control of coupled spin systems and expands on the understanding of spin electric coupling. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","iron; silver; titanium; data processing; displacement; electric field; magnetic field; adsorption; Article; binding site; degree of freedom; electron spin resonance; information processing; microwave radiation; quantitative analysis; scanning tunneling microscopy; solid state; topography","European Research Council, ERC, (681164); Center for Integrated Quantum Science and Technology, IQST","The authors would like to thank Juan Carlos Cuevas, Andreas Heinrich, Klaus Kern, Jose Lado, Sander Otte, and Aparajita Singha for fruitful discussions.

However, studying the phenomena requires working techniques to detach microorganisms and their DNA from mineral particles to which they strongly adhere. We developed a new method utilizing the competitive properties of anionic nanocellulose to block sorption of DNA to and detach microbial cells from mineral particles from ore processing. In general, up to one ng DNA mL−1 sample was obtained with the custom anionic nanocellulose method (CM) compared to DNA amounts below the Qubit assay's detection limit for extractions with a commercial kit (KIT). Similarly, 0.5–4 orders of magnitude more bacterial 16S and fungal 5.8S rRNA gene copies were detected by qPCR from CM treated samples compared to KIT extractions. A clear difference in the detected microbial community structure between CM and KIT extracted samples was also observed. Commercial kits optimized for mineral soils are easy to use and time efficient but may miss a considerable part of the microbial communities. A competing agent such as anionic nanocellulose may decrease the interaction between microorganisms or their DNA and minerals and provide a comprehensive view into the microbial communities in mineral processing environments. © 2023 The Authors","16S rRNA gene sequencing; fungi; Microbe-mineral interaction; Mineral flotation; Molecular techniques; Nucleic acid adsorption","","Horizon 2020, (730480)","This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation program under Grant Agreement no. 730480 , ITERAMS project (Integrated mineral technologies for more sustainable raw material supply) .

However, the known algorithms are either probabilistic (repeat until success) with unpractically small success probabilities or coherent (quantum amplitude amplification) with circuit depths and ancillary-qubit numbers unrealistically large in the mid-term. Our main contribution is a new generation of deterministic, high-precision QITE algorithms that are significantly more amenable experimentally. A surprisingly simple idea is behind them: partitioning the evolution into a sequence of fragments that are run probabilistically. It causes a considerable reduction in wasted circuit depth every time a run fails. Remarkably, the resulting overall runtime is asymptotically better than in coherent approaches, and the hardware requirements are even milder than in probabilistic ones. Our findings are especially relevant for the early fault-tolerance stages of quantum hardware. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Government of Spain, (FIS2020-TRANQI); Severo Ochoa CEX2019-000910-S; Fundación Cellex; Centres de Recerca de Catalunya, CERCA; European Research Council, ERC; Generalitat de Catalunya; Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca, AGAUR, (SGR 1381); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (305420/2018-6); Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, FAPERJ, (JCN E-26/202.701/2018, PDR10 E-26/202.802/2016); Instituto Serrapilheira, (Serra-1709-17173); Fundación Mig-Puig","Funding text 1: We thank Martin Kliesch for helpful comments that led us to write, Sec.

Currently, vacancy-related defects are at the forefront of high spatial resolution and low-dimensional sensing. On the other hand, it is expected that impurity-related defect structures may give rise to new features that could further advance quantum sensing in low dimensions. Here, we study the symmetric carbon tetramer clusters in hexagonal boron nitride and propose them as spin qubits for sensing. We utilize periodic-DFT and quantum chemistry approaches to reliably and accurately predict the electronic, optical, and spin properties of the studied defect. We show that the nitrogen-centered symmetric carbon tetramer gives rise to spin state-dependent optical signals with strain-sensitive intersystem crossing rates. Furthermore, the weak hyperfine coupling of the defect to their spin environments results in a reduced electron spin resonance linewidth that can enhance sensitivity. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Boron nitride; Carbon nitride; Electrospinning; III-V semiconductors; Oligomers; Quantum chemistry; Qubits; Spin dynamics; Strain rate; Atomic scale; Defects structure; Electronic spins; High spatial resolution; Low dimensional; Periodic DFT; Spin qubit; Symmetrics; Tetramers; Vacancy-related defects; Magnetic moments","Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Office of Information Technology; Quantum Information National Laboratory of Hungary, (2022-2.1.1-NL-2022-00004, FK 135496, FK 145395, K134983); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Institute for Advanced Study, IAS; Office of Science, SC; Basic Energy Sciences, BES; University of Alabama, UA; Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse, (2018.0071, TKP2021-NVA-04); Technische Universität München, TUM; National Supercomputer Centre, Linköpings Universitet, NSC; National Research, Development and Innovation Office","Funding text 1: Fruitful discussions with Igor Aharonovich and Jean-Philippe Tetienne are greatly acknowledged.

Quantum universal adversarial perturbations are small perturbations, which can make different input samples into adversarial examples that may deceive a given quantum classifier. This is a field that was rarely looked into but worthwhile investigating because universal perturbations might simplify malicious attacks to a large extent, causing unexpected devastation to quantum machine learning models. In this paper, we take a step forward and explore the quantum universal perturbations in the context of heterogeneous classification tasks. In particular, we find that quantum classifiers that achieve almost state-of-the-art accuracy on two different classification tasks can be both conclusively deceived by one carefully-crafted universal perturbation. This result is explicitly demonstrated with well-designed quantum continual learning models with elastic weight consolidation method to avoid catastrophic forgetting, as well as real-life heterogeneous datasets from hand-written digits and medical MRI images. Our results provide a simple and efficient way to generate universal perturbations on heterogeneous classification tasks and thus would provide valuable guidance for future quantum learning technologies. © 2023 The Author(s).

To meet the increasing demand for eggs, poultry farmers have used antibiotics to treat infections and, to some extent, promote growth and egg production in raising layer. However, the emergence and global spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria has now necessitated antibiotic-free poultry farming. As alternatives to antibiotics, prebiotics are feed additives that can be used to improve the growth and laying performance of poultry which positively impacts their performance and general health. In this study we evaluated the effect of lactulose, formulated as Vetelact, on body weight, egg production, egg quality, blood biochemical parameters and expression of genes associated with reproductive performance in laying hens. Results: Vetelact supplementation improved egg weight, egg production as well as egg quality. Following Vetalact supplementation, the levels of total bilirubin, total protein, globulin and phosphorus were increased, while the activities of alkaline phosphatase and lipase enzymes were increased compared to control. Vetelact at 0.10 ml/kg body weight upregulated OCX-36, OVAL, CALB1, OC-116, OCX-32 and IL8 transcripts while downregulating the transcription of Gal-10, PENK and AvBD9. At this optimal inclusion rate of Vetalect, histomorphologic analyses of intestinal tissue showed increased villi length with more goblet cell distribution and obvious mucus covering a surface, increase in the depth of intestinal crypts produce digestive enzymes, as well as more developed muscle layer that promote improved nutrient absorption. Conclusion: Vetelact at a dose of 0.10 ml/ kg body weight was effective in improving productive performance of laying hens. Adding lactulose (0.10 ml/ kg body weight) to layer diet is recommended to promote growth and improve egg laying performance in antibiotics-free poultry production. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Lactulose; Layer; OC-116; OCX-32; OCX-36; OVAL; Vetelact","Animal Feed; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Body Weight; Chickens; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Eggs; Female; Gene Expression; Lactulose; Prebiotics; alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; bilirubin; calbindin 1; creatinine; drinking water; gamma glutamyltransferase; glucose; interleukin 8; lactulose; membrane protein; ovocalyxin 36; prebiotic agent; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; lactulose; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; blood biochemistry; body weight; controlled study; down regulation; egg production; egg quality; gene expression; histopathology; nonhuman; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; upregulation; urea nitrogen blood level; animal; animal food; diet; dietary supplement; egg; female; Gallus gallus; veterinary medicine","","","M.I.

Therefore, a more reliable and fast fault section location(FSL) method is essential for the stable operation and optimization of distribution networks. In this context, this paper adopts an effective method to apply the quantum annealing algorithm(QA) based on the quantum tunneling mechanism to the distribution network fault section location problem. A quantum Hamiltonian function consisting of potential and kinetic energy terms is constructed based on the theoretical knowledge of QA. Among them, FSL objective function is mapped to the potential energy term, and the transverse magnetic field is introduced to construct the kinetic energy term, which can realize the quantum tunneling effect and approximate or even reach the global optimal solution. Based on the quantum Hamiltonian function construction, this paper modifies some parameters in the QA framework to propose an improved quantum annealing algorithm(IQA) to improve the accuracy. In the two test systems of IEEE 33-node distribution network and IEEE 33-node distribution network with distributed generation sources(DGs), QA and IQA are compared and analyzed with other intelligent algorithms using the average number of iterations and localization accuracy as indicators. We find that QA is more likely to obtain the global optimal solution compared with the simulated annealing algorithm(SA). IQA can search for faulty sections with 100% accuracy and the least number of average iterations in both single power distribution networks and distribution networks containing DGs. Under the scenarios of fault signal distortion and increasing fault sections, IQA shows superb competitive advantages by exhibiting good fault tolerance performance, global optimal search capability and stability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive perturbation; Distributed generation; Fault section location; Hamiltonian function; Information distortion; Tunneling effect","Annealing; Fault tolerance; Hamiltonians; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Location; Molecular physics; Optimal systems; Potential energy; Power quality; Simulated annealing; Adaptive perturbation; Annealing algorithm; Fault section location; Fault sections; Global optimal solutions; Information distortion; Node distribution; Quantum annealing; Quantum Hamiltonians; Tunneling effects; Distributed power generation","Proiect of Shanghai Science and Technology Committee, (23010501500); Shanghai Sailing Plan of “Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan” of China, (21YF1415100)","This work was supported by the grant of Shanghai Sailing Plan of “Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan” of China (No. 21YF1415100 ) and supported by Proiect of Shanghai Science and Technology Committee (No. 23010501500 ).","B.

The task of the original mathematical optimisation is then equivalent to finding the ground state of the corresponding spin system which can be achieved via quantum annealing relying on the adiabatic theorem. Some of the inherent disadvantages of this procedure can be alleviated or resolved using a stochastic approach, and by coupling to the external environment.

These can also offer understandings regarding non-adiabatic quantum phenomena. Well established methods focus mainly on propagating a quantum system that is initially described exclusively by the ground state wavefunction. In this work, we expand a previously developed size-extensive formalism within coupled cluster theory, called second response theory, so it propagates quantum systems that are initially described by a general linear combination of different states, which can include the ground state, and show how with a special set of time-dependent cluster operators such propagations are performed. Our theory shows strong consistency with numerically exact results for the determination of quantum mechanical observables, probabilities, and coherences. We discuss unperturbed non-stationary states within second response theory and their ability to predict matrix elements that agree with those found in linear and quadratic response theories. This work also discusses an approximate regularized methodology to treat systems with potential instabilities in their ground-state cluster amplitudes, and compares such approximations with respect to reference results from standard unitary theory. © 2023 The Author(s).

Here we report tunnelling spectroscopy measurements of three-terminal Josephson junctions realised in an InAs/Al heterostructure. The three terminals are connected to form two loops, enabling independent control over two phase differences and access to a synthetic Andreev band structure in the two-dimensional phase space. Our results demonstrate a phase-controlled Andreev molecule, originating from two discrete Andreev levels that spatially overlap and hybridise. Signatures of hybridisation are observed in the form of avoided crossings in the spectrum and band structure anisotropies in the phase space, all explained by a numerical model.

Its realization on noisy quantum computers without fault tolerance, however, is challenging because it requires a deep quantum circuit in general. We propose a strategy to run an entire QSP protocol on noisy quantum hardware by carefully reducing overhead costs at each step. To illustrate the approach, we consider the application of Hamiltonian simulation for which QSP implements a polynomial approximation of the time evolution operator. We test the protocol by running the algorithm on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer powered by Honeywell. In particular, we compute the time dependence of bipartite entanglement entropies for Ising spin chains and find good agreements with exact numerical simulations. To make the best use of the device, we determine optimal experimental parameters by using a simplified error model for the hardware and numerically studying the trade-off between Hamiltonian simulation time, polynomial degree, and total accuracy. Our results are the first step in the experimental realization of QSP-based quantum algorithms. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Computer hardware; Economic and social effects; Fault tolerance; Ising model; Polynomial approximation; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Signal processing; Trapped ions; Asymptotically optimal; Computational costs; Overhead costs; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum signal processing; Signal processing protocol; Time evolution operator; Trapped ion; Hamiltonians","","","Y.

Four types of sorted GQDs were investigated: undoped GQDs, nitrogen-doped GQDs (N-GQDs), amino-functionalized GQDs (amino-GQDs), and N-doped and amino-functionalized GQDs (amino-N-GQDs). Among them, the sorted amino-N-GQDs are effective as a two-photon photosensitizer and generate the highest quantity of reactive oxygen species for the elimination of multidrug-resistant cancer cells through two-photon photodynamic therapy (PDT). Larger amino-N-GQDs result in a greater number of C–N and N–functionalities, leading to a superior photochemical effect and more favorable intrinsic luminescence properties, making the dots effective contrast agents for tracking and localizing cancer cells during in-depth bioimaging in a three-dimensional biological environment under TPE in the NIR-II region. Overall, this study highlights the potential of large amino-N-GQDs as a material for future application to dual-modality two-photon PDT and biomedical imaging. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Excitation-wavelength-independent photoluminescence; Multi-drug resistance; Near-infrared–I/II; Sorted-graphene quantum dots; Two-photon imaging; Two-photon photodynamic therapy","Cancer cells; Cells; Diseases; Doping (additives); Graphene; Infrared devices; Laser excitation; Medical imaging; Nanocrystals; Photodynamic therapy; Photons; Photosensitizers; Sapphire; Semiconductor quantum dots; contrast medium; graphene; nitrogen; photosensitizing agent; quantum dot; reactive oxygen metabolite; Excitation wavelength; Excitation-wavelength-independent photoluminescence; Functionalized; Multidrug resistance; Near Infrared; Near-infrared; Near-infrared–I/II; Sorted-graphene quantum dot; Two photon imaging; Two-photon photodynamic therapies; absorption; Article; cancer cell; cancer resistance; excitation; human; human cell; illumination; luminescence; microscopy; multidrug resistance; photochemistry; photodynamic therapy; photoluminescence; quantum yield; radioisotope decay; Photoluminescence","Center for Allergy Immunology and Microbiome; China Medical University Children's Hospital; China Medical University Children's Hospital/China Medical University Hospital; Core Facility Center of National Cheng Kung University; Office of Research & Development at China medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, (EM000800, ESCA003700); American Institute of Mathematics, AIM; National Science and Technology Council, NSTC, (111-2113-M-039-003-MY2, NSTC 110-2314-B-039-056-MY3); China Medical University Hospital, CMUH; National Cheng Kung University Hospital, NCKU, (NCKUEDA11208); China Medical University, Taiwan, CMU, (1JA8, ANHRF111-13, DMR-111-215, DMR-112-043, DMR-112-205, DMR-HHC-111-5); Tainan Municipal An-Nan Hospital, TMANH","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the Center for Allergy Immunology and Microbiome (AIM) , China Medical University Children's Hospital/ China Medical University Hospital , China Medical University, Taiwan ( 1JA8; DMR-HHC-111-5 ; DMR-111-215 ; DMR-112-043 ; DMR-112-205 ); An Nan Hospital, China Medical University, Taiwan ( ANHRF111-13 ); National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) , Taiwan ( NSTC 111-2113-M-039-003-MY2 ; NSTC 110-2314-B-039-056-MY3 ); National Cheng Kung University Hospital and E-Da Hospital Bilateral Research Grant , Taiwan ( NCKUEDA11208 ).

For the addition of two n-bit numbers, our adder uses O(n)-O(nr) qubits and O(n)+O(nr) T gates to get the correct answer in T-depth O(r)+O(lognr) , where r is the radix. Quantum carry-lookahead adder has already attracted some attention because of its low T-depth. Our work further reduces the overall cost by introducing a higher radix layer. By analyzing the performance in T-depth, T-count, and qubit count, it is shown that the proposed adder is superior to existing quantum carry-lookahead adders. Even compared to the Draper out-of-place adder which is very compact and efficient, our adder is still better in terms of T-count. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","","","S.

Predictive biomarkers of neoadjuvant therapy response are needed to better identify patients with early stage disease who may benefit from tailored treatments in the adjuvant setting. As part of the TCHL phase-II clinical trial (ICORG10–05/NCT01485926) whole exome DNA sequencing was carried out on normal-tumour pairs collected from 22 patients. Here we report predictive modelling of neoadjuvant therapy response using clinicopathological and genomic features of pre-treatment tumour biopsies identified age, estrogen receptor (ER) status and level of immune cell infiltration may together be important for predicting response. Clonal evolution analysis of longitudinally collected tumour samples show subclonal diversity and dynamics are evident with potential therapy resistant subclones detected. The sources of greater pre-treatment immunogenicity associated with a pathological complete response is largely unexplored in HER2+ tumours. However, here we point to the possibility of APOBEC associated mutagenesis, specifically in the ER-neg/HER2+ subtype as a potential mediator of this immunogenic phenotype. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; progesterone receptor; adult; Article; breast cancer; cell infiltration; clinical article; clonal evolution; cohort analysis; DNA sequencing; female; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene expression; gene frequency; gene mutation; genetic analysis; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; human tissue; immunocompetent cell; immunogenicity; immunohistochemistry; logistic regression analysis; missense mutation; mutagenesis; mutational analysis; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; neoadjuvant therapy; phase 2 clinical trial; phenotype; point mutation; predictive model; prevalence; quality control; RNA sequence; sequence alignment; single nucleotide polymorphism; somatic mutation; treatment response; tumor gene; tumor microenvironment; tumor mutational burden; tumor suppressor gene; whole exome sequencing","Cancer Trials Ireland; North-East Cancer Research and Education Trust; SFI-HRB-Wellcome, (212529/Z/18/Z); Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI; Irish Cancer Society, (CCRC13GAL)","Funding text 1: We would like to thank the patients who took part in the TCHL phase II clinical trial sponsored by the All Ireland Oncology Research Group (ICORG) and Cancer Trials Ireland for kindly providing tumour tissue to enable this research study.

A known exception is localized systems that are non-ergodic and do not thermalize; however, local observables are still believed to become stationary. Here we demonstrate that this general picture is incomplete by constructing product states that feature periodic high-fidelity revivals of the full wavefunction and local observables that oscillate indefinitely. The system neither equilibrates nor thermalizes. This is analogous to the phenomenon of weak ergodicity breaking due to many-body scars and challenges aspects of the current phenomenology of many-body localization, such as the logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy. To support our claim, we combine analytic arguments with large-scale tensor network numerics for the disordered Heisenberg chain. Our results hold for arbitrarily long times in chains of 160 sites up to machine precision. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","analytical method; detection method; observational method; article; entropy; phenomenology","Quantum Valley Lower Saxony, (EXC-2123 QuantumFrontiers 390837967); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (SFB 1227)","H.W. would like to thank Merlin Füllgraf and Daniel Burgarth for useful discussions and Berislav Buča for comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

However, due to limited qubits or hardware noise, conducting large-scale experiments often requires significant resources. Moreover, the output of the model is susceptible to corruption by quantum hardware noise. To address this issue, we propose the use of ensemble techniques, which involve constructing a single machine learning model based on multiple instances of quantum neural networks. In particular, we implement bagging and AdaBoost techniques, with different data loading configurations, and evaluate their performance on both synthetic and real-world classification and regression tasks. To assess the potential performance improvement under different environments, we conducted experiments on both simulated, noiseless software and IBM superconducting-based QPUs, suggesting these techniques can mitigate the quantum hardware noise. Additionally, we quantify the amount of resources saved using these ensemble techniques. Our findings indicate that these methods enable the construction of large, powerful models even on relatively small quantum devices. © 2023, The Author(s).","Bagging; Boosting; Ensemble technique; Quantum machine learning; Quantum neural network","Machine learning; Qubits; Bagging; Boosting; Current generation; Ensemble techniques; Machine-learning; Performance; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Resource savings; Adaptive boosting","Gruppo Nazionale Calcolo Scientifico of “Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica Francesco Severi”; IRAP, (2018/MAB/5); PNRR; Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; CERN; European Commission, EC, (CN00000013 - CUP B83C22002940006); Fundacja na rzecz Nauki Polskiej, FNP; Università degli Studi di Verona","Funding text 1: The contribution of M.

In this work, a practical, scalable, verifiable (k, n) threshold continuous variable QSS protocol secure against eavesdroppers and dishonest players are proposed and demonstrated. The protocol does not require preparing the laser source by each player and phase locking of independent lasers. The parameter evaluation and key extraction can be accomplished by only the dealer and the corresponding player. By using the multiple sideband modulation, a single heterodyne detector can extract the information of multiple players. The practical security of the system is considered. The system is versatile, it can support the CKA protocol by only modifying the classic post-processing and requiring no changes to the underlying hardware architecture. By implementing the QSS and CKA protocols with five parties over 25 km (55 km) single-mode fibers, a key rate of 0.0061 (7.14 × 10−4) bits per pulse is observed. The results significantly reduces the system complexity and paves the way for the practical applications of QSS and CKA with efficient utilization of resources and telecom technologies. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Locks (fasteners); Network architecture; Network security; Quantum cryptography; Conference key agreement; Continuous variables; Experimental demonstrations; Key agreement protocol; Laser sources; Multiparty quantum secret sharing; Phase-locking; Quantum network; Quantum secret sharing; Secret sharing protocols; Single mode fibers","Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0300703); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (1331KSC, 62175138, 62205188)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62175138, 62205188); Shanxi 1331KSC; Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology (2021ZD0300703).

However, with the exponential increase in the number of images and the complexity of the required tasks, deep-learning classification algorithms demand more intensive resources and computational power to train the models and update the massive number of parameters. Quantum computing is a new research technology with a promising capability of exponential speed up and operational parallelization with its unique phenomena including superposition and entanglement. Researchers have already started utilizing Quantum Deep Learning (QDL) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in image classification. Yet, to our knowledge, there exists no comprehensive published literature review on quantum image classification. Therefore, this paper analyzes the advances in this field by dividing the studies based on a unique taxonomy, discussing the limitations, summarizing essential aspects of each research, and finally, emphasizing the gaps, challenges, and recommendations. One of the key challenges presented in the paper is that quantum computers are in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, where they contain a limited number of noisy qubits, therefore challenging complex quantum classifiers and complex images from advanced datasets. This research recommends constructing a novel quantum image encoding method that adapts to the available number of qubits and enables RGB images as a critical contribution to the existing research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Quantum Convolutional Neural Network; Quantum Image Classification; Quantum K Nearest Neighbor; Quantum Support Vector Machine; Quantum Tensor Network; Variational Quantum Circuit","Classification (of information); Complex networks; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image classification; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Timing circuits; Convolutional neural network; Images classification; Nearest-neighbour; Quantum circuit; Quantum convolutional neural network; Quantum image classification; Quantum images; Quantum K near neighbor; Quantum support vector machine; Quantum tensor network; Support vectors machine; Variational quantum circuit; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; classifier; convolutional neural network; deep learning; deep neural network; imaging and display; information processing; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; parameterized quantum circuit; probability; quantum convolutional neural network; quantum deep learning; quantum image classification; quantum k nearest neighbor; quantum machine learning; quantum support vector machine; quantum tensor network; quanvolutional neural network; Short Survey; support vector machine; task performance; taxonomy; variational quantum deep neural network; Support vector machines","","","R.

The observation of moiré patterns in mechanically stacked graphene layers has triggered rapid progress in graphene research. These moiré patterns arise due to the relative difference in the orientation of the mechanically stacked graphene layers. Since their first appearance, moiré superlattices have become a platform for advanced materials and different quantum phenomena. Graphene bilayer, obtained from the mechanical stacking of two decoupled graphene layers, has become archetypal. Weak inter-layer forces can sometimes induce angular disorder in the array that causes unconventional stacking of layers. This unconventional stacking induces several angle-dependent properties in twisted bilayer graphene (t-BLG) which are unprecedented for graphene itself. This review examines recent advances in t-BLG covering aspects of its electronic structure, fabrication, angle-dependent properties and the spectroscopic signatures. © 2023 The Author(s)","Brillouin zones; Moiré patterns; Superconductivity; Twisted bilayer graphene; van der Waal heterostructures","","","","A.H.

IBDV evolution resulted in the emergence of strains with divergent genetic, antigenic, and pathogenic characteristics. Genetic classification is typically performed by sequencing the coding region of the most immunogenic region of the viral protein 2 (VP2). Sequencing both double-stranded RNA genome segments is essential to achieve a more comprehensive IBDV classification that can detect recombinants and reassortments. Here, we report the development and standardization of a tiled PCR amplicon protocol for the direct and cost-effective genome sequencing of global IBDV strains using next-generation technology. Primers for tiled PCR were designed with adapters to bypass expensive and time-consuming library preparation steps. Sequencing was performed on Illumina MiniSeq equipment, and fourteen complete genomes of field strains were assembled using reference sequences. The PCR-enrichment step was used to obtain genomes from low-titer biological samples that were difficult to amplify using traditional sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses of the obtained genomes confirmed previous strain classification. By combining the enrichment methodology with massive sequencing, it is possible to obtain IBDV genomic sequences in a fast and affordable manner. This procedure can be a valuable tool to better understand virus epidemiology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Avian; Genome evolution; Gumboro disease virus; Whole genome sequencing","double stranded DNA; primer DNA; amplicon; Article; bird; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; gene sequence; high throughput sequencing; infectious bursal disease; infectious bursal disease virus; molecular evolution; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; standardization; virus assembly; virus classification; virus genome; virus load; virus strain; whole genome sequencing","Comisión Académica de Posgrado; Agencia Nacional de Investigación e Innovación, ANII, (POS_FMV_2018_1_1007820); Comisión Sectorial de Investigación Científica, CSIC; Programa de Desarrollo de las Ciencias Básicas, PEDECIBA, (2018/2021)","This work was supported by PEDECIBA [Grant Number: Research 2018/2021 ], Agencia Nacional de Investigación e Innovación [ POS_FMV_2018_1_1007820 ], Comisión Académica de Posgrado , and CSIC 2018 (grant: Equipment, Genomic Platform, Faculty of Science).

In this work, we define and study the complexity class NISQ, which encapsulates problems that can be efficiently solved by a classical computer with access to noisy quantum circuits. We establish super-polynomial separations in the complexity among classical computation, NISQ, and fault-tolerant quantum computation to solve some problems based on modifications of Simon’s problems. We then consider the power of NISQ for three well-studied problems. For unstructured search, we prove that NISQ cannot achieve a Grover-like quadratic speedup over classical computers. For the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, we show that NISQ only needs a number of queries logarithmic in what is required for classical computers. Finally, for a quantum state learning problem, we prove that NISQ is exponentially weaker than classical computers with access to noiseless constant-depth quantum circuits. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","complexity; computer simulation; equipment; quantum mechanics; algorithm; Article; computer model; human; noisy intermediate scale quantum; quantum mechanics","NISQ; National Science Foundation, NSF, (2103300); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-SC0007870); Society of Fellows, Harvard University; Google","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Isaac Chuang for valuable conversations on complexity classes for learning theory, John Preskill for inspiring discussions on NISQ and its complexity class formulation, and John Wright for bringing76and related works to our attention.

Since several of the envisioned applications require exposure to magnetic fields, it is of utmost importance to explore the impact of magnetic fields on their performance. Here we explore the complex pattern of magnetic field penetration and identify its impact on the resonance frequency of NbTiN superconducting resonators by combining magneto-optical imaging and high-frequency measurements. At temperatures below approximately half of the superconducting critical temperature, the development of magnetic flux avalanches manifests itself as a noisy response in the field-dependent resonance frequency. Magneto-optical imaging reveals different regimes and distinguishes the impact of avalanches in the ground plane and resonator. Our findings demonstrate that superconducting resonators represent a valuable tool to investigate magnetic flux dynamics. Moreover, the current blooming of niobium-based superconducting radio-frequency devices makes this report timely by unveiling the severe implications of magnetic flux dynamics. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Magnetic fields; Magnetic flux; Natural frequencies; Optical image storage; Superconducting resonators; Titanium compounds; Building blockes; Complex pattern; Magnetic field penetrations; Magnetic flux avalanches; Magnetic flux dynamics; Magnetic-field; Magnetooptical imaging; Performance; Quantum circuit; Resonance frequencies; Niobium compounds","AndQC; European Union’s H2020 research and innovation program, (804988); FRS-FNRS; European Cooperation in Science and Technology, COST, (CA21144); Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS, FNRS, (CDR J.0176.22, Weave-PDR T.0208.23); Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO, (11K6523N, G0D7723N); KU Leuven, (C14/21/083); Sydney Institute of Marine Science, SIMS, (828948)","The authors acknowledge support from the EU COST action SUPERQUMAP CA21144, the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS under the grants Weave-PDR T.0208.23 and CDR J.0176.22, the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO, Belgium), Grants No. G0D7723N and 11K6523N, and the KU Leuven C1 program C14/21/083.

Our understanding about terrestrial subsurface microbiomes is almost exclusively derived from groundwater and porous sediments mainly by using 16S rRNA gene surveys. To obtain more insights about biomass of consolidated rocks and the metabolic status of endolithic microbiomes, we investigated interbedded limestone and mudstone from the vadose zone, fractured aquifers, and deep aquitards. Results: By adapting methods from microbial archaeology and paleogenomics, we could recover sufficient DNA for downstream metagenomic analysis from seven rock specimens independent of porosity, lithology, and depth. Based on the extracted DNA, we estimated between 2.81 and 4.25 × 105 cells × g−1 rock. Analyzing DNA damage patterns revealed paleome signatures (genetic records of past microbial communities) for three rock specimens, all obtained from the vadose zone. DNA obtained from deep aquitards isolated from surface input was not affected by DNA decay indicating that water saturation and not flow is controlling subsurface microbial survival. Decoding the taxonomy and functional potential of paleome communities revealed increased abundances for sequences affiliated with chemolithoautotrophs and taxa such as Cand. Rokubacteria. We also found a broader metabolic potential in terms of aromatic hydrocarbon breakdown, suggesting a preferred utilization of sedimentary organic matter in the past. Conclusions: Our study suggests that limestones function as archives for genetic records of past microbial communities including those sensitive to environmental stress at modern times, due to their specific conditions facilitating long-term DNA preservation.

We generate generalised n-qubit GHZ states and measure Bell inequalities to investigate the n-party entanglement of the GHZ states. The implemented Bell inequalities are derived from non-adaptive measurement-based quantum computation (NMQC), a type of quantum computing that links the successful computation of a non-linear function to the violation of a multipartite Bell-inequality. The goal is to compute a multivariate Boolean function that clearly differentiates non-local correlations from local hidden variables (LHVs). Since it has been shown that LHVs can only compute linear functions, whereas quantum correlations are capable of outputting every possible Boolean function it thus serves as an indicator of multipartite entanglement. Here, we compute various non-linear functions with NMQC on IBM’s quantum computer IBM Quantum System One and thereby demonstrate that the presented method can be used to characterize quantum devices. We find a violation for a maximum of seven qubits and compare our results to an existing implementation of NMQC using photons. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Competence Center Quantum Computing Baden-Württemberg; Ministerium für Wirtschaft, Arbeit und Tourismus Baden-Württemberg; Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung, CZS; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz, BMWK; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; Universität Stuttgart; Center for Integrated Quantum Science and Technology, IQST","We thank Jonas Helsen for the useful suggestions and explanations, Alexandra R. van den Berg for the fruitful discussions, Roeland Wiersema for the helpful tips and Chewon Cho (조채원) for the in-depth explanations.

It is crucial in quantum parameter estimation, central to the ultimate Cramér-Rao bound. Recently, the evaluation of QFIM using quantum circuit algorithms has been proposed for systems with multiplicative parameters Hamiltonian. However, systems with generic Hamiltonians still lack these proposed schemes. This work introduces a quantum-circuit-based approach for evaluating QFIM with generic Hamiltonians. We present a time-dependent stochastic parameter-shift rule for the derivatives of evolved quantum states, whereby the QFIM can be obtained. The scheme can be executed in universal quantum computers under the family of parameterized gates. In magnetic field estimations, we demonstrate the consistency between the results obtained from the stochastic parameter-shift rule and the exact results, while the results obtained from a standard parameter-shift rule slightly deviate from the exact ones. Our work sheds new light on studying QFIM with generic Hamiltonians using quantum circuit algorithms. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Fisher information; Generic Hamiltonian; Quantum circuit; Quantum metrology; Stochastic parameter-shift rule; Variational algorithm","Hamiltonians; Parameter estimation; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Stochastic systems; Timing circuits; Fisher information; Fisher information matrices; Generic hamiltonian; Parameter shifts; Quantum circuit; Quantum metrology; Stochastic evaluations; Stochastic parameter-shift rule; Stochastic parameters; Variational algorithms; Fisher information matrix","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (23K13025)","Funding text 1: Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI, 23K13025. ; Funding text 2: This work is supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 23K13025.

However, the underlying optimization processes within these algorithms usually deal with local minima and barren plateau problems, preventing them from scaling efficiently. Our goal in this paper is to study alternative optimization methods that can avoid or reduce the effect of these problems. To this end, we propose to apply the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to VQAs optimizations. Our hypothesis is that DE is resilient to vanishing gradients and local minima for two main reasons: (1) it does not depend on gradients, and (2) its mutation and recombination schemes allow DE to continue evolving even in these cases. To demonstrate the performance of our approach, first, we use a robust local minima problem to compare state-of-the-art local optimizers (SLSQP, COBYLA, L-BFGS-B and SPSA) against DE using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm. Our results show that DE always outperforms local optimizers. In particular, in exact simulations of a 1D Ising chain with 14 qubits, DE achieves the ground state with a 100% success rate, while local optimizers only exhibit around 40%. We also show that combining DE with local optimizers increases the accuracy of the energy estimation once avoiding local minima. Finally, we demonstrate how our results can be extended to more complex problems by studying DE performance in a 1D Hubbard model. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; differential evolution algorithm; simulation","Galician Regional Government; I+D+I en Galicia; Planes Complementarios de I+D+I con las Comunidades Autónomas; European Commission, EC, (PRTR-C17); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN; Axencia Galega de Innovación, GAIN","Funding text 1: We thank the CESGA Quantum Computing group members for feedback and the stimulating intellectual environment they provide.

Our approaches lessen waste in compared to standard procedures by maximizing '0′ GO and reducing CI. The 4-bit SIPO register has a 70 % increase in CI performance over previous designs and also provides SISO capability with a 50 % CI and 100 % GO boost. Our proposed designs for the SIPO, SISO, PIPO, and PISO registers also result in a 70 % and 80 % improvement in CI and GO for the 4-bit PISO register.

Although many analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing are available, an in-depth analysis of the insect gut microbiome to identify genes with plastic-degrading potential is still lacking. Results: In the present work, we aim to fill this gap using Black Soldier Fly (BSF) as insect model. BSF larvae have proven capability to efficiently bioconvert a wide variety of organic wastes but, surprisingly, have never been considered for plastic degradation. BSF larvae were reared on two widely used plastic polymers and shotgun metagenomics was exploited to evaluate if and how plastic-containing diets affect composition and functions of the gut microbial community. The high-definition picture of the BSF gut microbiome gave access for the first time to the genomes of culturable and unculturable microorganisms in the gut of insects reared on plastics and revealed that (i) plastics significantly shaped bacterial composition at species and strain level, and (ii) functions that trigger the degradation of the polymer chains, i.e., DyP-type peroxidases, multicopper oxidases, and alkane monooxygenases, were highly enriched in the metagenomes upon exposure to plastics, consistently with the evidences obtained by scanning electron microscopy and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analyses on plastics. Conclusions: In addition to highlighting that the astonishing plasticity of the microbiota composition of BSF larvae is associated with functional shifts in the insect microbiome, the present work sets the stage for exploiting BSF larvae as “bioincubators” to isolate microbial strains and enzymes for the development of innovative plastic biodegradation strategies. However, most importantly, the larvae constitute a source of enzymes to be evolved and valorized by pioneering synthetic biology approaches.

Atomic layer etching (ALE) is an emerging subtractive fabrication method which is capable of etching with angstrom-scale etch depth control and potentially less damage. However, while ALE processes for TiN have been reported, they either employ HF vapor, incurring practical complications, or the etch rate lacks the desired control. Furthermore, the superconducting characteristics of the etched films have not been characterized. Here, we report an isotropic plasma-thermal TiN ALE process consisting of sequential exposures to molecular oxygen and an SF 6 /H 2 plasma. For certain ratios of SF 6 :H 2 flow rates, we observe selective etching of TiO 2 over TiN, enabling self-limiting etching within a cycle. Etch rates were measured to vary from 1.1 Å/cycle at 150 ° C to 3.2 Å/cycle at 350 ° C using ex situ ellipsometry. We demonstrate that the superconducting critical temperature of the etched film does not decrease beyond that expected from the decrease in film thickness, highlighting the low-damage nature of the process. These findings have relevance for applications of TiN in microwave kinetic inductance detectors and superconducting qubits. © 2023 Author(s).","","Molecular oxygen; Sulfur hexafluoride; Superconducting films; Titanium dioxide; Titanium nitride; Atomic layer etching; Etch rates; Etched films; Etching process; Isotropic plasma; Microwave loss; SF 6; Thermal; TiN films; Titanium nitride films; Etching","Molecular Materials Research Center of the Beckman Institute at the California Institute of Technology; National Science Foundation, NSF, (2234390); Kavli Nanoscience Institute, California Institute of Technology, KNI, CIT; Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, TU/e","Funding text 1: This work was supported by NSF under Award No. 2234390.

The amount of DNA data grows very fast, and many new genomes are waiting to be sequenced while millions of private genomes need to be re-sequenced. Each human genome has 3.2B base pairs, and each one could be stored with 2 bits of information, so one human genome would take 6.4B bits or ∼760MB of storage (National Institute of General Medical Sciences, n.d.). Today's most powerful tensor processing units cannot handle the volume of DNA data necessitating a major leap in computing power. It is, therefore, important to investigate the usefulness of quantum computers in genomic data analysis, especially in DNA sequence alignment. Quantum computers are expected to be involved in DNA sequencing, initially as parts of classical systems, acting as quantum accelerators. The number of available qubits is increasing annually, and future quantum computers could conduct DNA sequencing, taking the place of classical computing systems. We present a novel quantum algorithm for reference-guided DNA sequence alignment modeled with gate-based quantum computing. The algorithm is scalable, can be integrated into existing classical DNA sequencing systems and is intentionally structured to limit computational errors. The quantum algorithm has been tested using the quantum processing units and simulators provided by IBM Quantum, and its correctness has been confirmed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","DNA alignment; DNA sequencing; Quantum algorithms; Quantum computing","Bioinformatics; Computing power; Digital storage; DNA sequences; Gene encoding; Molecular biology; Quantum optics; Qubits; DNA alignment; DNA data; Dna sequences alignments; DNA Sequencing; Human genomes; Processing units; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum gates; DNA","","","I.G.

The recently developed biphoton frequency comb (BFC) provides a powerful platform for high-dimensional quantum information processing in its spectral and temporal quantum modes. Here we propose and generate a singly-filtered high-dimensional BFC via spontaneous parametric down-conversion by spectrally shaping only the signal photons with a Fabry-Pérot cavity. High-dimensional energy-time entanglement is verified through Franson-interference recurrences and temporal correlation with low-jitter detectors. Frequency- and temporal- entanglement of our singly-filtered BFC is then quantified by Schmidt mode decomposition. Subsequently, we distribute the high-dimensional singly-filtered BFC state over a 10 km fiber link with a post-distribution time-bin dimension lower bounded to be at least 168. Our demonstrations of high-dimensional entanglement and entanglement distribution show the singly-filtered quantum frequency comb’s capability for high-efficiency quantum information processing and high-capacity quantum networks. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Distributed computer systems; Fabry-Perot interferometers; Information filtering; Optical frequency conversion; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Advanced technology; Biphotons; Frequency combs; High-dimensional; Higher-dimensional; Large-scales; Noise tolerants; Quantum information processing; Quantum network; Time frequency; Mode decomposition","Army Research Office Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative, (W911NF-21-2-0214); National Science Foundation, NSF, (1741707); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; Division of Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Activities, EFMA, (1919355, 1936375, 2137984)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge discussions with Zhenda Xie, Changchen Chen, Abhinav Kumar Vinod, Wei Liu, Jiahui Huang, Patrick Hayden, Pengfei Fan, Mi Lei, Charles Ci Wen Lim, and Alexander Euk Jin Ling; discussions on the superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors with Vikas Anant; Justin Caram for the help on the heralded auto-correlation measurements with a Hydraharp.

FDA has been successfully applied to investigate the universal dynamical responses of a heavy impurity in an ultracold ideal Fermi gas in both the time and frequency domain, which allows the exploration of the renowned Anderson’s orthogonality catastrophe (OC). In such a system, OC is induced by the multiple particle-hole excitations of the Fermi sea, which is beyond a simple perturbation picture and manifests itself as the absence of quasiparticles named polarons. More recently, two new directions for studying heavy impurity with FDA have been developed. One is to extend FDA to a strongly correlated background superfluid background, a Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid. In this system, Anderson’s orthogonality catastrophe is prohibited due to the suppression of multiple particle-hole excitations by the superfluid gap, which leads to the existence of genuine polaron. The other direction is to generalize the FDA to the case of multiple RF pulses scheme, which extends the well-established 1D Ramsey spectroscopy in ultracold atoms into multidimensional, in the same spirit as the well-known multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance and optical multidimensional coherent spectroscopy. Multidimensional Ramsey spectroscopy allows us to investigate correlations between spectral peaks of an impurity-medium system that is not accessible in the conventional one-dimensional spectrum. © 2023, Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies.","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (DE180100592, DP190100815)","This research was supported by the Australian Research Council’s (ARC) Discovery Program, Grants No. DE180100592 and No. DP190100815.

In this paper, producing the distributed entangled state of superconducting (SC) qubits is considered using an entanglement swapping protocol in three successive stages. The SC qubit pairs (i,i+1 with i=1,3,5,7) , where each pair of the qubits has been placed on a separate chip, are initially prepared in maximally entangled states. The external magnetic fields on capacitively coupled pairs (2,3) and (6,7) are implemented for modulating the frequency of qubits. Then, the SC qubits (1,4) and (5,8) are converted into entangled states via operating proper measurements instead of Bell state measurement (which is generally a hard task). Finally, the distributed entangled state of target SC qubits (1,8) can be obtained by applying external magnetic fields on qubits (4,5) and via operating suitable measurements. This process is studied in the absence and presence of thermal decoherence effects. The concurrence, as a measure of entanglement between two target qubits, success probability of the distributed entangled states and the corresponding fidelities are evaluated, by which we find that the state of target SC qubits (1,8) is converted to Bell state with maximum entanglement at some moments of time. Under appropriate conditions the maximum of success probability of the obtained states in each stage approaches 1. However, the maxima of concurrence and success probability gradually decrease due to the thermal noise as time goes on. Moreover, compelling amounts of fidelity, success probability and entanglement can be obtained for the achieved entangled states. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; magnetic field; noise; probability","","","M.K.

Often, the fabrication of spin qubits relies on the use of gate dielectrics which are detrimental to the quality of the resonator. Here, we investigate loss mechanisms of high-impedance NbTiN resonators in the vicinity of thermally grown SiO2 and Al2O3 fabricated by atomic layer deposition. We benchmark the resonator performance in elevated magnetic fields and at elevated temperatures and find that the internal quality factors are limited by the coupling between the resonator and two-level systems of the employed oxides. Nonetheless, the internal quality factors of high-impedance resonators exceed 103 in all investigated oxide configurations which implies that the dielectric configuration would not limit the performance of resonators integrated in a spin-qubit device. Because these oxides are commonly used for spin qubit device fabrication, our results allow for straightforward integration of high-impedance resonators into spin-based quantum processors. Hence, these experiments pave the way for large-scale, spin-based quantum computers. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Atomic layer deposition; Benchmarking; Dielectric materials; Gate dielectrics; Niobium compounds; Qubits; Silica; Titanium compounds; Atomic-layer deposition; Elevated temperature; High impedance; Impedance resonators; Internal quality factors; Loss mechanisms; Magnetic-field; Performance; Qubit devices; Spin qubit; Resonators","NCCR Spin Qubit in Silicon; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (847471); H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA; Swiss Nanoscience Institute, SNI; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (192027); Horizon 2020, (828948); National Center of Competence in Research Quantum Science and Technology, NCCR QSIT; Botnar Research Centre for Child Health, University of Basel, BRCCH","This research was supported by the Swiss Nanoscience Institute (SNI), the Swiss National Science Foundation through grant 192027 and through the NCCR Spin Qubit in Silicon (NCCR-Spin).

In this regard, we address designing a hybrid channel comprising a single-mode cavity accompanied by a super-Gaussian beam and local dephasing parts based on the dynamics of quantum characteristics. We choose two-level atoms and various functions such as traced-distance discord, concurrence, and local-quantum uncertainty to analyze the effectiveness of the hybrid channel to preserve quantum correlations along with entropy suppression discussed using linear entropy. The joint configuration of the considered fields is found to not only preserve but also generate quantum correlations even in the presence of local dephasing. Most importantly, within certain limits, the proposed channel can be readily regulated to generate maximal quantum correlations and complete suppression of the disorder. Besides, compared to the individual parts, mixing the Fock state cavity, super-Gaussian beam, and local dephasing remains a resourceful choice for the prolonged quantum correlations’ preservation. Finally, we present an interrelationship between the considered two-qubit correlations’ functions, showing the deviation between each two correlations and of the considered state from maximal entanglement under the influence of the assumed hybrid channel. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11975236); University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, UCAS","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China(NSFC) under the Grants 11975236 and by the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The integration of quantum technology into this mix will lead to unimaginable benefits and be regarded as a giant leap forward in mankind’s ability to compute. Demonstrating the benefits of this integration now becomes essential. With the advance of quantum computing, several machine-learning techniques have been proposed that use quantum annealing. In this study, we implement a matrix factorization method using quantum annealing for image classification and compare the performance with traditional machine-learning methods. Nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF) was originally introduced as a generative model, and we propose a multiclass classification model as an application. We extract the features of handwritten digit images using NBMF and apply them to solve the classification problem. Our findings show that when the amount of data, features, and epochs is small, the accuracy of models trained by NBMF is superior to classical machine-learning methods, such as neural networks. Moreover, we found that training models using a quantum annealing solver significantly reduces computation time. Under certain conditions, there is a benefit to using quantum annealing technology with machine learning. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; artificial neural network; human; machine learning; multiclass classification","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP23H04499)","This study was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP23H04499.

The control over charge-state transitions and subsequent molecular vibrations using scanning tunneling microscopy typically requires the use of a decoupling layer. Here we show the vibronic excitations of tetrabromotetraazapyrene (TBTAP) molecules directly adsorbed on Ag(111) into an orientational glassy phase. The electron-deficient TBTAP is singly-occupied by an electron donated from the substrate, resulting in a spin 1/2 state, which is confirmed by a Kondo resonance. The TBTAP•− discharge is controlled by tip-gating and leads to a series of peaks in scanning tunneling spectroscopy. These occurrences are explained by combining a double-barrier tunneling junction with a Franck-Condon model including molecular vibrational modes. This work demonstrates that suitable precursor design enables gate-dependent vibrational excitations of molecules on a metal, thereby providing a method to investigate electron-vibration coupling in molecular assemblies without a decoupling layer. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","electron microscopy; electron spin resonance; quantum mechanics; tunneling; vibration; article; excitation; scanning tunneling spectroscopy; vibration","Georg H.

Although various quantum authentication methods have been proposed recently, their implementation efficiency is limited. This paper proposes a key-controlled maximally mixed quantum state encryption (MMQSE) method using only a single qubit, unitary operation, minimized quantum transmissions, and a single qubit measurement, which improves implementation feasibility and operation efficiency. We applied it to representative quantum authentication applications, namely, quantum identity and message authentication. The security of our authentication schemes was verified by analyzing the relationship between the integral ratio of Uhlmann’s fidelity and probability of successful eavesdropping. Moreover, we demonstrate the higher authentication efficiency of the proposed scheme in a real quantum-channel noise environment. The upper bound of the valid noise rate was quantified using the integral ratio of Uhlmann’s fidelity in a noise environment. Finally, the optimal number of authentication sequences was estimated. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Quantum identity authentication; Quantum message authentication; Uhlmann’s fidelity; Unitary operation","Authentication; Communication channels (information theory); Quantum cryptography; Quantum efficiency; Quantum optics; Qubits; Authentication methods; Message authentication; Quantum authentication; Quantum identity authentication; Quantum message authentication; Quantum messages; Quantum state; Single qubits; Uhlmann’s fidelity; Unitary operation; Quantum communication","Commercializations Promotion Agency, (2022SCPO_B_0210); Korea Institute of Science and Technology, KIST, (2E31531, 2E32801); Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, KISTI; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2021M1A2A2043892, 2022M3K4A1097119); Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP, (2020-0-00890); Korea Research Environment Open Network, KREONET","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) (2021M1A2A2043892, 2022M3K4A1097119), Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) (2020-0-00890), the Commercializations Promotion Agency for R&D Outcomes (2022SCPO_B_0210), KREONET Advanced Research Program Grant from KISTI, and KIST research program (2E31531, 2E32801).

These processes are fundamental to modern technologies and applications, such as nuclear fusion energy, advanced manufacturing, communication, and green transportation, which often involve one mole or more atoms and elementary particles, and thus are challenging to compute by using the first principles of quantum physics or other forward models. One of the central problems in U-RadIT is to optimize information yield through, e.g. high-luminosity X-ray and particle sources, efficient imaging and tracking detectors, novel methods to collect data, and large-bandwidth online and offline data processing, regulated by the underlying physics, statistics, and computing power. We review and highlight recent progress in: (a.) Detectors such as high-speed complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) cameras, hybrid pixelated array detectors integrated with Timepix4 and other application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and digital photon detectors; (b.) U-RadIT modalities such as dynamic phase contrast imaging, dynamic diffractive imaging, and four-dimensional (4D) particle tracking; (c.) U-RadIT data and algorithms such as neural networks and machine learning, and (d.) Applications in ultrafast dynamic material science using XFELs, synchrotrons and laser-driven sources. Hardware-centric approaches to U-RadIT optimization are constrained by detector material properties, low signal-to-noise ratio, high cost and long development cycles of critical hardware components such as ASICs. Interpretation of experimental data, including comparisons with forward models, is frequently hindered by sparse measurements, model and measurement uncertainties, and noise. Alternatively, U-RadIT make increasing use of data science and machine learning algorithms, including experimental implementations of compressed sensing. Machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches, refined by physics and materials information, may also contribute significantly to data interpretation, uncertainty quantification and U-RadIT optimization. © 2023 The Author(s)","CMOS; Compressed sensing; Data science; Imaging; Machine learning; Optimization; Pixelated detectors; Tracking; Ultrafast","CMOS integrated circuits; Compressed sensing; Computing power; Constrained optimization; Data handling; Dynamics; Learning algorithms; Light sources; MOS devices; Oxide semiconductors; Photons; Signal to noise ratio; Uncertainty analysis; X ray detectors; Complementary metal oxide semiconductors; Compressed-Sensing; Forward modeling; Machine-learning; Material science; Optimisations; Pixelated detectors; Radiographic imaging; Tracking; Ultra-fast; Machine learning","Ann Satsangi; Mr. Jack Heyer; NIM-A; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Argonne National Laboratory, ANL, (DE-AC02-06CH11357); Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD; Johns Hopkins University, JHU; Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL, (89233218CNA000001); SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, SLAC","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Ms. Samantha Thurman (SLAC) and Mr. Jack Heyer (SLAC) for helping with the organization of Ultrafast Imaging and Tracking Instrumentation, Methods and Application (ULITIMA 2023) Conference, March 13–16, 2023, Menlo Park, CA, USA.

Early prediction of RA is necessary for the treatment and management of the disease. The current work presents a deep learning and quantum computing-based automated diagnostic approach for RA in hand thermal imaging. The study’s goals are (i) to develop a custom RANet model and compare its performance with the pretrained models and quanvolutional neural network (QNN) to distinguish between the healthy subjects and RA patients, (ii) To validate the performance of the custom model using feature selection method and classification using machine learning (ML) classifiers. The present study developed a custom RANet model and employed pre-trained models such as ResNet101V2, InceptionResNetV2, and DenseNet201 to classify the RA patients and normal subjects. The deep features extracted from the RA Net model are fed into the ML classifiers after the feature selection process. The RANet model, RA Net+ SVM, and QNN model produced an accuracy of 95%, 97% and 93.33% respectively in the classification of healthy groups and RA patients. The developed RANet and QNN models based on thermal imaging could be employed as an accurate automated diagnostic tool to differentiate between the RA and control groups. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Autoimmune Diseases; Computing Methodologies; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Quantum Theory; artificial neural network; autoimmune disease; computer analysis; diagnostic imaging; human; quantum theory; rheumatoid arthritis","SRM Hospital and Research Centre; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Majmaah University, MU, (R-2023-586)","Funding text 1: Fadiyah M.

This paper describes experimental and theoretical understanding showing how paramagnetic single-molecule magnet (SMM) catalyzes long-range effects on metal electrodes and, in that process, loses its basic magnetic properties. For the first time, our Monte Carlo simulations, verified for consistency with regards to experimental studies, discuss the properties of the whole device and a generic paramagnetic molecule analog (GPMA) connected to the combinations of ferromagnet-ferromagnet, ferromagnet-paramagnet, and ferromagnet-antiferromagnet metal electrodes. We studied the magnetic moment vs. magnetic field of GPMA exchange coupled between two metal electrodes along the exposed side edge of cross junction-shaped magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). We also studied GPMA-metal electrode interfaces’ magnetic moment vs. magnetic field response. We have also found that the MTJ dimension impacted the molecule response. This study suggests that SMM spin at the MTJ exposed sides offers a unique and high-yield method of connecting molecules to virtually endless magnetic and nonmagnetic electrodes and observing unprecedented phenomena in the molecular spintronics field. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Agency, (DE-FOA-0003945); National Science Foundation-CREST, (#HRD- 1914751); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (80NSSC19M0196)","We gratefully acknowledge the funding support that was in part supported by the National Science Foundation-CREST Award (Contract #HRD- 1914751), the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Agency (DE-FOA-0003945), and NASA MUREP Institutional Research Opportunity Grant under Cooperative Agreement #80NSSC19M0196.

The study of the magnetic properties of metal oxide nanowires is of particular importance for the development of these technological implementations. The present work is devoted to an ab initio study of the magnetic properties of Mn and Mn oxide (MnO) nanowires on vicinal Au surfaces with different step edge geometries. The existence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations of Mn and MnO nanowires on vicinal Au surfaces was found. The effect of oxidations and surface geometry on the appearance of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic properties of the nanowire was revealed. The ground state of pure Mn nanowires was shown to be dependent on the surface structure. At the same time, the ground state of oxide Mn nanowires is antiferromagnetic on all studied vicinal surfaces and did not depend on the surface structure. We observed an increase in the exchange interaction energy in nanowires under surface oxidation. The exchange interaction between manganese atoms in MnO nanowires is much stronger than in pure Mn nanowires. © 2023","Ab-initio calculations; Magnetic properties; Metal oxide nanowires; VASP","Antiferromagnetism; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Gold; Ground state; Magnetic storage; Manganese oxide; Nanowires; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Ab initio calculations; Au surfaces; Magnetic configuration; Magnetic nanostructures; Magnetic storage systems; Metal oxide nanowires; Mn oxides; Quantum Computing; Quantum magnetics; VASP; Magnetic properties","","","K.M.

However, integrative profiling of cfDNA methylome and fragmentome has been technologically challenging. Here, we adapt an enzyme-mediated methylation sequencing method for comprehensive analysis of genome-wide cfDNA methylation, fragmentation, and copy number alteration (CNA) characteristics for enhanced cancer detection. We apply this method to plasma samples of 497 healthy controls and 780 patients of seven cancer types and develop an ensemble classifier by incorporating methylation, fragmentation, and CNA features. In the test cohort, our approach achieves an area under the curve value of 0.966 for overall cancer detection. Detection sensitivity for early-stage patients achieves 73% at 99% specificity. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility to accurately localize the origin of cancer signals with combined methylation and fragmentation profiling of tissue-specific accessible chromatin regions. Overall, this proof-of-concept study provides a technical platform to utilize multimodal cfDNA features for improved cancer detection. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell-Free Nucleic Acids; DNA Methylation; Epigenome; Epigenomics; Humans; Neoplasms; apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide like; circulating free DNA; genomic DNA; cell free nucleic acid; tumor marker; cancer; cell; DNA; genome; methylation; plasma; advanced cancer; aneuploidy; Article; bioinformatics; blood sampling; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer localization; cancer patient; cancer tissue; chromatin; chromosome arm; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; controlled study; copy number variation; diagnostic accuracy; DNA fragmentation; DNA methylation; early cancer; early cancer diagnosis; epigenome; esophagus cancer; feature extraction; human; human genome; human tissue; leave one out cross validation; limit of detection; liver cancer; lung cancer; machine learning; major clinical study; methylome; pancreas cancer; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; single nucleotide polymorphism; stomach cancer; support vector machine; tissue specificity; whole genome sequencing; DNA methylation; epigenetics; genetics; neoplasm; procedures","Central Health Research Key Projects, (2022ZD17); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (2021YFC2500400, 81871885); Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences, CAMS, (2021-I2M-1-061); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFC2500900); Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Initiative for Innovative Medicine, (2021-I2M-1-015)","The authors are grateful to all patients and their families for their voluntary participation in this study.

Most existing tools for the depiction of quantum speed limit are the lower-bound-type tools, which are in fact difficult to reveal the true minimum time, especially for many-body systems or complex dynamics. Therefore, the evaluation of this true minimum time in these scenarios is still an unsolved problem. Hereby we provide the operational definition of quantum speed limit for a general target and propose a three-step (classification-regression-calibration) methodology based on machine learning to evaluate the true minimum time in complex dynamics.

In physiological concentrations, ROS and especially free radicals play an essential role in sperm maturation and fertilization, while an overabundance could lead to OS-induced damage to spermatozoa. To date, there are no direct detection techniques available that can measure the total amount of free radicals real time and identify where and when free radicals are generated. This study applies a quantum sensing technique using fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs), called T1 relaxometry, which is uniquely sensitive and specific for free radicals allowing measurements of the current radical load for nanoscale detection in living cells and body fluids. This proof-of-principle study investigates if we can use this technique to detect the free radical generation in human whole and separated, using density gradient centrifugation, semen. This method could be potentially used as new diagnostic measure for unexplained infertility or to track the effect of therapeutic interventions such as lifestyle changes. We adapted the existing relaxometry technique to measure free radicals in semen. The measured relaxation time (T1 time) was correlated to sperm concentration and progressive motility. Additionally, we explored the influence of the oxidative trigger hydrogen peroxide and the antioxidant glutathione on the free radical concentration measured. No significant correlations were found, which indicates that measurements in more proximity of the sperm cell are required to use relaxometry as a potential diagnostic tool for unexplained male infertility. © 2023 The Authors","Diamond magnetometry; Fluorescent nanodiamond; Free radicals; Human semen; Oxidative stress; Relaxometry","Antioxidants; Body fluids; Fluorescence; Free radicals; Magnetometry; Antioxidant defense system; Biological mechanisms; Diamond magnetometry; Fluorescent nanodiamond; Human semen; Male infertility; Physiological concentrations; Reactive oxygen species; Relaxometry; Sperm maturation; Nanodiamonds","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO; Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen, UMCG","The authors would like to express their gratitude towards the laboratory analysists of the Centre of Reproductive Medicine of the University Medical Centre Groningen.

In particular, quantum circuits in place of classical convolutional filters for image detection-based tasks are being investigated for the ability to exploit quantum advantage. However, these attempts, referred to as quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), lack the ability to efficiently process data with multiple channels and, therefore, are limited to relatively simple inputs. In this work, we present a variety of hardware-adaptable quantum circuit ansatzes for use as convolutional kernels, and demonstrate that the quantum neural networks we report outperform existing QCNNs on classification tasks involving multi-channel data. We envision that the ability of these implementations to effectively learn inter-channel information will allow quantum machine learning methods to operate with more complex data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Convolutional neural networks; Image classification; Multi-channel data; Quantum machine learning; Supervised learning","Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Supervised learning; Convolutional neural network; Images classification; Machine-learning; Multi channel; Multichannel data; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Speed up; Image classification","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2124511)","We acknowledge the support provided by the NSF CCI grant (Award Number 2124511).

Recently, the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) has emerged as a strong contender, excelling in generating high-resolution images with complex features similar to those found in real-world images. In this study, we investigate DDPM's potential as both generator and predictor of scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, encompassing both known and unseen microstructural conditions. To rigorously evaluate DDPM, we curated a comprehensive dataset comprising 27 distinct cast-forged AZ80 magnesium alloy components with varied process parameters and microstructure features. Some conditions were held back during training to test DDPM's predictive abilities for unseen scenarios. Our study demonstrates the model's remarkable capacity to capture the inherent physical relationships between process parameters and microstructure features. We scrutinize the synthesized images alongside real-world SEM counterparts, undertaking a comprehensive analysis of various morphological properties. Remarkably, the results show the model's performance, with an average error of 6.36 % ± 0.42 for measured microstructural properties in seen conditions and an equally impressive 6.67 % ± 0.85 for unseen conditions. This study envisions a transformative shift in materials science, as advanced AI predictive models offer new potential to streamline the laborious process of microstructure image generation. © 2023 The Author(s)","Cast-forging; Denoising diffusion probabilistic model; Dynamic recrystallization; Image generation; Magnesium alloys; Mg<sub>17</sub>Al<sub>12</sub> intermetallic","Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Deep learning; Dynamic recrystallization; Image denoising; Intermetallics; Magnesium alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Cast-forging; Condition; De-noising; Denoising diffusion probabilistic model; Dynamic recrystallisation; Image generations; Mg17al12 intermetallic; Probabilistic models; Process parameters; Scanning electrons; Diffusion","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (STPGP 521551); Alliance de recherche numérique du Canada, l’Alliance","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial contribution from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), through their Strategic Partnership Grant STPGP 521551 .

It has been predicted that carbon nanosolenoid materials with Riemann surfaces have unique structures and novel physical properties. Here we report the first synthesis of a nitrogen-doped carbon nanosolenoid (N-CNS) using bottom-up approach with a well-defined structure. N-CNS was obtained by a rational Suzuki polymerization, followed by oxidative cyclodehydrogenation. The successful synthesis of N-CNS was fully characterized by GPC, FTIR, solid-state 13C NMR and Raman techniques. The intrinsic single-strand molecular structures of N-CNS helices can be clearly resolved using low-dose integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC-STEM) technique. Possessing unique structural and physical properties, this long π-extended polymer N-CNS can provide new insight towards bottom-up syntheses of curved nanoribbons and potential applications as a metal-free photocatalyst for visible-light-driven H2 evolution and highly efficient photocatalyst for photoredox organic transformations. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","carbon; nitrogen; absorption; carbon; catalysis; nanomaterial; nitrogen; photochemistry; polymerization; visible spectrum; absorption; Article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; chemical structure; contrast enhancement; controlled study; dispersity; electron microscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; gel permeation chromatography; molecular weight; photocatalysis; polymerization; Raman spectrometry; scanning electron microscopy; scanning transmission electron microscopy; synthesis; X ray photoemission spectroscopy","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (21771161, 21971229, 22075250, 22122505, 22225108, 52172053); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFE0113800)","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22225108, 21971229, 52172053, 22075250, 22122505, 21771161) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFE0113800).

We find that the soliton can exhibit stable motion along the chain without a skyrmion Hall effect for an extended range of drives. Under a constant drive the solitons have a constant velocity. We also measure the skyrmion velocity–current curves and identify the signatures of different phases including a pinned phase, stable soliton motion, and quasi-free motion at higher drives where all of the skyrmions depin from the pinning centers and move along the rigid wall. In the quasi-free motion regime, the velocity is oscillatory due to the motion of the skyrmions over the pinning sites. For increasing pinning strength, the onset of soliton motion shifts to higher values of current density. We also find that for stronger pinning, the characteristic velocity–current shape is affected by the annihilation of single or multiple skyrmions in the drive interval over which the soliton motion occurs. Our results indicate that stable skyrmion soliton motion is possible and that the solitons could be used as information carriers instead of the skyrmions themselves for technological applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Skyrmion; Solitons; Transport","Annihilation; Microcracks; Atomistics; Constant velocities; Extended range; Ferromagnetics; Free motion; Interstitials; Magnetic simulation; Skyrmions; Stable motion; Transport; Solitons","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (892333218NCA000001); National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA; Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2022/14053-8); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (2017/20976-3)","Funding text 1: J.C.B.S acknowledges funding from Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo - FAPESP, Brazil (Grant 2022/14053-8 ) and Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - CAPES, Brazil . ; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the US Department of Energy through the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Special-purpose hardware such as Ising machines, particularly memristor-based analog Ising machines, have emerged as promising solutions. However, existing simulate-annealing-based implementations have not fully exploited the inherent parallelism and analog storage/processing features of memristor crossbar arrays. This work proposes a quantum-inspired parallel annealing method that enables full parallelism and improves solution quality, resulting in significant speed and energy improvement when implemented in analog memristor crossbars. We experimentally solved tasks, including unweighted and weighted Max-Cut and traveling salesman problem, using our integrated memristor chip. The quantum-inspired parallel annealing method implemented in memristor-based hardware has demonstrated significant improvements in time- and energy-efficiency compared to previously reported simulated annealing and Ising machine implemented on other technologies. This is because our approach effectively exploits the natural parallelism, analog conductance states, and all-to-all connection provided by memristor technology, promising its potential for solving complex optimization problems with greater efficiency. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","efficiency measurement; hardware; optimization; simulated annealing; adiabaticity; algorithm; Article; comparative study; conductance; degradation; memristor; noise; phase transition; process optimization; quantum mechanics; signal processing; simulated annealing","Hewlett Packard Labs; Hong Kong and Macau, (62122005); InnoHK; Croucher Foundation, (MHP/066/20); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (27210321)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Xia Sheng, John Paul Strachan, Giacomo Pedretti, Jim Ignowski from Hewlett Packard Labs for providing the integrated memristor crossbar platform.

The physical features of the solitons are revealed through three-, two-, contour, and density graphs.

Here we analyze the finite-key effect for the MP-QKD protocol with rigorous security proof against general attacks. Moreover, we propose a six-state MP-QKD protocol and analyze its finite-key effect. The results show that the original protocol can break the repeaterless rate-transmittance bound with a typical finite number of pulses in practice. And our six-state protocol can improve the secret key rate significantly in long distance cases. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Locks (fasteners); Side channel attack; Distribution analysis; Finite number; Phase-locking; Protocol cans; Quantum-key- distribution protocol; Secret key; Security proofs; Side-channel attacks; Quantum cryptography","Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0300701); Jiangsu provincial key R & D Program, (BE2022071); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62105318, 62171424, 62271463); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M693098, 2022M723064); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020YFA0309802); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work has been supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2020YFA0309802), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 62171424, 62105318, and 62271463), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2021M693098 and 2022M723064), Prospect and Key Core Technology Projects of Jiangsu provincial key R & D Program (BE2022071), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, the Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology (Grant No. 2021ZD0300701).

Researchers have developed code smell detectors using manual and semi-automatic methods to identify these issues. However, three key challenges have limited the practical use of these detectors: developers’ subjective perceptions of code smells, lack of consensus in the detection process, and difficulty in setting appropriate detection thresholds. While code smell detection using machine learning has progressed significantly, there still appears to be a gap in understanding the effective utilization of deep learning (DL) approaches. This paper aims to review and identify current methods for code smell detection using DL techniques. A systematic literature review is conducted on 35 primary studies from a collection of 8739 publications between 2013 and the present. The analysis reveals that common code smells detected include Feature Envy, God Classes, Long Methods, Complex Classes, and Large Classes. The most popular DL algorithms used are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), often combined with other techniques for better results. Algorithms that train models on large datasets with fewer independent variables demonstrate exemplary performance. The paper also highlights open issues and provides guidelines for future metric identification and selection research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Antipatterns; Code smells; Deep learning; Smell detection; Software smells","Codes (symbols); Convolutional neural networks; Learning systems; Odors; Recurrent neural networks; Software design; Anti-patterns; Code smell; Deep learning; Practical use; Semiautomatic methods; Smell detection; Software development principles; Software smell; Subjective perceptions; Systematic literature review; Large dataset","","","B.

Coupling exciton-polaritons with magnetic orders grants access to rich many-body phenomena, but has been limited by the availability of material systems that exhibit simultaneous exciton resonances and magnetic ordering. Here we report magnetically-dressed microcavity exciton-polaritons in the van der Waals antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductor CrSBr coupled to a Tamm plasmon microcavity. Using angle-resolved spectroscopy, we reveal an exceptionally high exciton-photon coupling strength, up to 169 meV, demonstrating ultrastrong coupling that persists up to room temperature. By performing temperature-dependent spectroscopy, we show the magnetic nature of the exciton-polaritons in CrSBr microcavity as the magnetic order changes from AFM to paramagnetic. By applying an out-of-plane magnetic field, we achieve effective tuning of the polariton energy while maintaining the ultrastrong exciton-photon coupling strength. We attribute this to the spin canting process that modulates the interlayer exciton interaction. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","detection method; instrumentation; polarization; wavelength; anisotropy; Article; crystallization; data analysis; electron beam; photoluminescence; polarization; refraction index; spectroscopy","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11975035, 12241401, 12250007, 61875001, 62035017, 62175002, 92150301); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2023TQ0003); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (JQ21018); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFA0306900, 2022YFA1206700)","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2022YFA1206700, and 2018YFA0306900), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants Nos. 12241401, 11975035, 61875001, 12250007, 62175002, 62035017, and 92150301), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2023TQ0003), and the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. JQ21018).

Experimental investigations of such scenarios, all of which have been based on a process known as the quantum switch, have provided demonstrations of indefinite causal order conditioned on assumptions on the devices used in the laboratory. But is a device-independent certification possible, similar to the certification of Bell nonlocality through the violation of Bell inequalities? Previous results have shown that the answer is negative if the switch is considered in isolation. Here, however, we present an inequality that can be used to device-independently certify indefinite causal order in the quantum switch in the presence of an additional spacelike-separated observer under an assumption asserting the impossibility of superluminal and retrocausal influences. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","certification; experimental study; quantum mechanics; theoretical study; article; certification; human","Quantum Information Structure of Spacetime; John Templeton Foundation, JTF, (62312); Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, ISED; Government of Canada; Croucher Foundation; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (SRFS2021-7S02); Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science, MRIS","T.vd.L. is grateful to Nikolai Miklin, Nick Ormrod, and Marc-Olivier Renou for insightful discussions.

The impact of materials and fabrication steps on dielectric losses can be evaluated using coplanar waveguide (CPW) microwave resonators. Here, we report on superconducting CPW microwave resonators with internal quality factors systematically exceeding 5 × 106 at high powers and 2 × 106 (with the best value of 4.4 × 106) at low power. Such performance is demonstrated for 100-nm-thick aluminum resonators with 7–10.5 um center trace on high-resistivity silicon substrates commonly used in Josephson-junction based quantum circuit. We investigate internal quality factors of the resonators with both dry and wet aluminum etching, as well as deep and isotropic reactive ion etching of silicon substrate. Josephson junction compatible CPW resonators fabrication process with both airbridges and silicon substrate etching is proposed. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of airbridges’ positions and extra process steps on the overall dielectric losses. The best quality factors are obtained for the wet etched aluminum resonators and isotropically removed substrate with the proposed ultrasonic metal edge microcutting. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","BMSTU, (74300)","Technology was developed and samples were fabricated at the BMSTU Nanofabrication Facility (Functional Micro/Nanosystems, FMNS REC, ID 74300).","I.A.

These systems can be implemented using hybrid platforms, which efficiently couple optical photons and microwaves via intermediate agents, e.g. phonons. Semiconductor exciton-polariton microcavities operating in the strong light-matter coupling regime offer enhanced coupling of near-infrared photons to GHz phonons via excitons. Furthermore, a new coherent phonon-exciton-photon quasiparticle termed phonoriton, has been theoretically predicted to emerge in microcavities, but so far has eluded observation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate phonoritons, when two exciton-polariton condensates confined in a μ m-sized trap within a phonon-photon microcavity are strongly coupled to a confined phonon which is resonant with the energy separation between the condensates. We realize control of phonoritons by piezoelectrically generated phonons and resonant photons. Our findings are corroborated by quantitative models. Thus, we establish zero-dimensional phonoritons as a coherent microwave-to-optical interface. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","energy efficiency; optical method; quantum mechanics; separation; article; microwave radiation; phonon; photon; quantitative analysis","EU-BMBF, (13N14783); German DFG, (359162958); PAIDI 2020, (P20-00548); Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, AvH; Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica, ANPCyT, (PICT-2018-03255)","ASK and PVS acknowledge the funding from German DFG (grant 359162958) and QuantERA grant Interpol (EU-BMBF (Germany) grant nr. 13N14783).

Here, we experimentally execute a reinforcement learning strategy, using a single trapped 40Ca+ ion, for engineering quantum state evolution out of thermal equilibrium. We consider a qubit system coupled to classical and quantum baths, respectively, the former of which is achieved by switching on the spontaneous emission relevant to the qubit and the latter of which is made based on a Jaynes-Cummings model involving the qubit and the vibrational degree of freedom of the ion. Our optimized operations make use of the external control on the qubit, designed by the reinforcement learning approach. In comparison to the conventional situation of free evolution subject to the same Hamiltonian of interest, our experimental implementation presents the evolution of the states with higher fidelity while with less consumption of entropy production and work, highlighting the potential of reinforcement learning in accomplishment of optimized nonequilibrium thermodynamic processes at atomic level. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Entropy; Hamiltonians; Jaynes-Cummings model; Learning systems; Qubits; Thermal Engineering; Trapped ions; Learning strategy; Non equilibrium; Optimized process; Quantum information processing; Quantum state; Quantum thermodynamics; Reinforcement learnings; Single-atoms; State evolutions; Thermal-equilibrium; Reinforcement learning","Key Lab of Guangzhou for Quantum Precision Measurement, (202201000010); Key Research & Development Project of Guangdong Province, (2020B0303300001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11804308, 11804375, 11835011, 12064004, 12074346, 12074390, 12275077, 12304315, 92265107, U21A20434); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2022M710881, 2023T160144); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2022JJ30277)","We acknowledge thankfully the technical support of ultrastable optical cavity and frequency stabilization from the group of Professor Qunfeng Chen.

Moruzzi 1, Pisa, 56124, Italy","The application of a periodic nonresonant drive to a system allows the Floquet engineering of effective fields described by a broad class of quantum simulated Hamiltonians. The Floquet evolution is based on two different elements. The first one is a time-independent or stroboscopic evolution with an effective Hamiltonian corresponding to the quantum simulation target. The second element is the time evolution at the frequencies of the nonresonant driving and of its harmonics, denoted as micromotion. We examine experimentally and theoretically the harmonic dual-dressing Floquet engineering of a cold atomic two-level sample. Our focus is the dressing operation with small bare energies and large Rabi frequencies, where frequencies and amplitudes of the stroboscopic/micromotion time evolutions are comparable. At the kHz range of our dressed atom oscillations, we probe directly both the stroboscopic and micromotion components of the qubit global time evolution. We develop ad-hoc monitoring tools of the Floquet space evolution. The direct record of the time evolution following a pulsed excitation demonstrates the interplay between the two components of the spin precession in the Floquet space. From the resonant pumping of the dressed system at its evolution frequencies, Floquet eigenenergy spectra up to the fifth order harmonic of the dressing frequency are precisely measured as function of dressing parameters. Dirac points of the Floquet eigenenergies are identified and, correspondingly, a jump in the dynamical phase shift is measured. The stroboscopic Hamiltonian eigenfrequencies are measured also from the probe of the micromotion sidebands.These monitoring tools are appropriate for quantum simulation/computation investigations. Our results evidence that the stroboscopic phase shift of the qubit wavefunction contains an additional information that opens new simulation directions. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; cold stress; excitation; oscillation; simulation","Marco Polini; Gruppo Nazionale per la Fisica Matematica, GNFM","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge technical assistance from A.

However, there are concerns about complexity in quantum communication networks, such as potentially limited end-to-end transmission capacity. These challenges call for model systems in which the impact of complex topology on quantum communication protocols can be explored. Here, we present a theoretical model for complex quantum communication networks on a lattice of spins, wherein entangled spin clusters in interacting quantum spin systems serve as communication links between appropriately selected regions of spins. Specifically, we show that ground state Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger clusters of the two-dimensional random transverse-field Ising model can be used as communication links between regions of spins. Further, the resulting quantum networks can have complexity comparable to that of the classical internet. Our work provides a generative model for further studies towards determining the network characteristics of the emerging quantum internet. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Complex networks; Ground state; Ising model; Quantum entanglement; Topology; Communications networks; Complex topology; End-to-end transmission; Modelling systems; Network models; Network topology; Quantum communication protocols; Quantum network; Spin cluster; Transmission capacities; Quantum communication","Anastasiya Salova; Helen S.

These systems leverage the parallel processing power of quantum computers to perform complex computations while utilizing classical algorithms to handle the vast amounts of data involved in imaging. The hybrid approach is intended to improve accuracy and speed compared to traditional classical methods. Further research and development in this area can revolutionize the way medical images are classified and help improve patient diagnosis and treatment. The use of Conventional Neural Networks (CNN) for the classification and diagnosis of medical images using big datasets requires, in most cases, the use of special high-performance computing machines, which are very expensive and hard to access by most researchers. A new form of Machine Learning (ML), Quantum machine learning (QML), is being introduced as an emerging strategy to overcome this problem. A hybrid quantum–classical CNN uses both quantum and classical convolution layers designed to use a parameterized quantum circuit. This means that the computing model utilizes a quantum circuits approach to construct QML algorithms, which are then used to transform the quantum state to extract image hidden features. This computational acceleration is expected to achieve better algorithm performance than classical CNNs. This study intends to evaluate the performance of a Hybrid Quantum CNN (HQCNN) against a conventional CNN. This is followed by some optimizer modifications for both proposed and classical CNN methods to investigate the possible further improvement of their performance. The optimizer modification is based on forcing the optimizer to be directly adaptive to model accuracy. The optimizer adaptiveness is based on the development of an optimizer with a loss base adaptive momentum. Several algorithms are developed to achieve the above-mentioned goals, including CNN, QCNN, CNN with the adaptive optimizer, and QCNN with the Adaptive optimizer. The four algorithms are tested against a Kaggle brain dataset containing over 7000 samples. The test results show the hybrid quantum circuit algorithm outperformed the conventional CNN algorithm. The performance of both algorithms was further improved by using a fully adaptive SGD optimizer. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Adaptive momentum; CNN; Hybrid QCNN; Medical diagnosis; Neural networks; Parameterized Quantum Circuits ‘PQC’","Algorithms; Brain; Humans; Machine Learning; Motion; Neural Networks, Computer; algorithm; artificial neural network; brain; human; machine learning; motion","","","N.

Zinc Oxide thin films plays crucial role in revolutionizing performance of optical and electrical devices. In this study, laser-induced third-order optical nonlinearity in Zinc oxide thin film samples are investigated. This method is used to investigate the nonlinear refraction using the high-intensity source. Zinc oxide has been deposited on p-type silicon substrate using sol–gel techniques with various substrate temperature of room temperature (RT), 300 °C, and 500 °C. The samples have been characterized by X-ray diffraction studies. And the deposited zinc oxide film shows hexagonal wurtzite structure and the lattice parameters change with substrate temperature. Surface morphology of Zinc oxide thin film samples are analysed using FE-SEM and branching like urchin morphology is observed and the size of rods and crystallites of thin films increases, when temperature is varied. A pulsed laser beam having a wavelength of 532 nm has been used as the excitation source. Reflective Z-scan (RZ-scan) technique of open aperture was performed, since zinc oxide thin film samples are opaque. Normalized reflectance is fitted to experimental data to calculate nonlinear reflective index, n2 of the sample and the values of n2 estimated for room temperature (RT), 300 °C, and 500 °C are 1.5 × 10–9 cm2/W, 2.9 × 10–9 cm2/W and 25.3 × 10–9 cm2/W. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","FE-SEM; RZ-scan; Sol–gel technique; Thin film; XRD; Zinc oxide","Binding energy; Crystallite size; II-VI semiconductors; Laser beams; Laser excitation; Morphology; Nonlinear optics; Optical films; Optical properties; Oxide films; Pulsed lasers; Room temperature; Semiconductor quantum wells; Sols; Substrates; Surface morphology; Zinc oxide; Zinc sulfide; Exciton-binding energy; Nonlinear optical properties; Reflective Z-scan; Sol-gel technique; Substrates temperature; Thin-films; XRD; Z-scan technique; Zinc oxide thin films; ZnO thin film; Thin films","","","G.

An attractive approach for implementing these operations is to couple these resonators via a nonlinear converter and actuate parametric processes with RF drives. It can be challenging to make these processes simultaneously fast and high fidelity, since this requires introducing strong drives without activating parasitic processes or introducing additional decoherence channels. We show that in addition to a careful management of drive frequencies and the spectrum of environmental noise, leveraging the inbuilt symmetries of the converter Hamiltonian can suppress unwanted nonlinear interactions, preventing converter-induced decoherence. We demonstrate these principles using a differentially-driven DC-SQUID as our converter, coupled to two high-Q microwave cavities. Using this architecture, we engineer a highly-coherent beamsplitter and fast (~100 ns) swaps between the cavities, limited primarily by their intrinsic single-photon loss. We characterize this beamsplitter in the cavities’ joint single-photon subspace, and show that we can detect and post-select photon loss events to achieve a beamsplitter gate fidelity exceeding 99.98%, which to our knowledge far surpasses the current state of the art. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","microwave radiation; noise; nonlinearity; quantum mechanics; spectrum; article; microwave radiation; noise; nonhuman; parity; photon; squid","Yale Institute for Nanoscience and Quantum Engineering; Yale SEAS Cleanroom; Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-16-1-0349, W911NF-18-1-0212, W911NF-22-1-0053); Government of South Australia","Funding text 1: We thank J.

The data collected fuel many automation applications such as smart cities, industrial automation 5.0, autonomous vehicles and healthcare sectors. However, the critical challenges concerning such an environment are Open Web Security and Mutual Authentication. The recent security protocols of IoT are based on hard mathematical cryptographic structures. Nevertheless, dependency on the security of classical cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by Quantum Computing. Recent Quantum attacks on IoT security have motivated us to survey Quantum-resistant solutions comprehensively. Therefore in this paper, we analysed how the technology shifts from classical cryptographic techniques towards quantum-enabled solutions to achieve end-to-end security. The main objective of this survey is to provide a systematic roadmap in the area of Quantum secured 5G-enabled IoT communication by covering current research on 5G-enabled IoT with its key enabling technologies, threats imposed on 5G-enabled IoT applications, state-of-the-art quantum-based solutions and initiatives. A detailed overview of the quantum computing preliminaries, Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) schemes, Quantum Cryptography (QC), and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with their significant advantage in securing IoT-enabled communication over classical scenarios are also presented. Particularly, we emphasize Post-Quantum resistant techniques that must be used soon to secure 5G-enabled IoT communications. The comparative analysis of quantum-resistant schemes with classical cryptographic schemes in terms of key size, data size, time complexity and impact of quantum computers on these schemes are discussed. This paper identifies the technical challenges in Quantum-based schemes and provides future research directions to enable Post-Quantum resistant cryptography for secure communication in 5G-enabled IoT. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Internet of Things; Post quantum cryptography; Quantum cryptography; Review; Security; Wireless sensor networks","","","","P.S.

Skyrmions are commonly realized by inducing large Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) in the interface of heavy metal heterolayers. With the advent of two-dimensional magnetism, it is being envisioned to host intrinsic skyrmions in a monolayer, which will be free from any interfacial defect and stacking order. Here using high-fidelity exchange-correlation functional-based first-principles calculations, we investigate such a possibility in methodically designed non-centrosymmetric MXene structures. From a search space of about 3000 materials, our customized high-throughput computational pipeline systematically harnesses out-of-the-plane and in-plane magnetism along with strong DMI to realize typical ‘unipolar’ skyrmions in 78 materials and exotic ‘bipolar’ skyrmions in 13 materials. Micromagnetic and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations further reveal that skyrmions in some of these materials may be stable at room temperature without any external magnetic field. Our study may pave the way for the practical realization of skyrmions-based information technology. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Computation theory; Energy efficiency; Intelligent systems; Monolayers; Monte Carlo methods; Textures; Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction; Energy efficient; First principle calculations; Heterolayers; High-fidelity; Information carriers; Interfacial defect; Skyrmions; Spin textures; Two-dimensional; Heavy metals","Centre for Development of Advanced Computing; Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB, (CRG/2020/000758)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to express their heartfelt gratitude to the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in India for providing access to the cutting-edge PARAM Siddhi-AI supercomputer and extending a full waiver of the huge computational charges incurred in this work.

The considered states are formed by the superposition of two Gaussian wave packets localized on opposite sides of a smooth barrier in a dispersive medium and moving towards each other. The process generated by this dynamics is analyzed regarding the influence of the barrier parameters on the nonclassical properties of these states in the phase space below and above the barrier regime. The performed analysis employs entropic measure resulting from the Wigner–Rényi entropy for the fixed Rényi index. The universal relation of this entropy for the Rényi index equal one half with the nonclassicality parameter understood as a measure of the negative part of the Wigner distribution function is proved. This relation is confirmed in the series of numerical simulations for the considered states. Furthermore, the obtained results allowed the determination of the lower bound of the Wigner–Rényi entropy for the Rényi index greater than or equal to one half. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","animal experiment; article; cat; computer simulation; entropy; nonhuman","AGH University of Krakow; Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza im.

However, previous developments have focused on emulating the operation of quantum computers similarly, implementing every p-bit with large weight-sum matrix multiplication blocks and requiring tens of times more p-bits than semiprime bits. In addition, operations based on a conventional simulated annealing scheme required a large number of sampling operations, which deteriorated the performance of the Ising machines. Here we introduce a prime factorization machine with a virtually connected Boltzmann machine and probabilistic annealing method, which are designed to reduce the hardware complexity and number of sampling operations. From 10-bit to 64-bit prime factorizations were performed, and the machine offers up to 1.2 × 108 times improvement in the number of sampling operations compared with previous factorization machines, with a 22-fold smaller hardware resource. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Samsung, (SRFC-IT2101-03)","This work was supported by Samsung Research Funding & Incubation Center of Samsung Electronics under Project Number SRFC-IT2101-03.

The significant wavefunction size of these highly-excited states (proportional to n2) enables strong long-range dipole-dipole (proportional to n4) and van der Waals interactions (proportional to n11). Currently, the highest-lying Rydberg states are found in naturally occurring Cu 2O . However, for technological applications, the ability to grow high-quality synthetic samples is essential. The fabrication of thin-film Cu 2O samples is of particular interest as they hold potential for observing extreme single-photon nonlinearities through the Rydberg blockade. Nevertheless, due to the susceptibility of high-lying states to charged impurities, growing synthetic samples of sufficient quality poses a substantial challenge. This study successfully demonstrates the CMOS-compatible synthesis of a Cu 2O thin film on a transparent substrate that showcases Rydberg excitons up to n= 8 which is readily suitable for photonic device fabrications. These findings mark a significant advancement towards the realization of scalable and on-chip integrable Rydberg quantum technologies. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Purdue University Startup fund; National Science Foundation, NSF, (2224960); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-23-1-0489); Göran Gustafssons Stiftelse för Naturvetenskaplig och Medicinsk Forskning; Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2019-04821)","The authors acknowledge stimulating discussions with S.

We used graphene quantum dots (GQDs) known as the formula C24H12 as a model for studying the effect of zinc oxide (ZnO) dimers on the structural and electronic properties of GQDs by density functional theory (DFT) investigation. By modifying a GQD geometrical pattern with ZnO dimers, three different forms of ZnO dimers are used to create the zinc and oxygen atoms in the ortho, meta, and para positions. Based on our findings, it has been found that the bandgap values of the GQD structure are significantly influenced by the presence and form of ZnO dimers. the electronic characteristics of GQD are affected not only by the number of GQD dimers present but also by the arrangement of ZnO dimers within the GQD. By suitably doping ZnO dimers, we can tune the bandgap of GQDs. These findings provide insight into how chemical doping affects the electronic characteristics of GQDs and motivate the design of nanodevices with improved electronic performance. © 2023 The Author(s)","Bandgap; Chemical doping; DFT; Quantum dots; ZnO dimers","","","","F.N.

Here, we study real-valued signful ground-state wave functions of frustrated quantum spin systems and, assuming that the tasks of finding wave function amplitudes and signs can be separated, show that the signs can be easily bootstrapped from the amplitudes. We map the problem of finding the sign structure to an auxiliary classical Ising model defined on a subset of the Hilbert space basis. We show that the Ising model does not exhibit significant frustrations even for highly frustrated parental quantum systems, and is solvable with a fully deterministic O(KlogK) -time combinatorial algorithm (where K is the Ising model size). Given the ground state amplitudes, we reconstruct the signs of the ground states of several frustrated quantum models, thereby revealing the hidden simplicity of many-body sign structures. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Ground state; Learning systems; Monte Carlo methods; Quantum optics; Wave functions; Deterministics; Eigenstates; Ground state wavefunctions; Machine learning methods; Many body; Many-body quantum systems; Non-trivial; Quantum monte carlo; Quantum spin systems; Quantum system; Ising model","FASTCORR; SURF; European Research Council, ERC, (854843)","Funding text 1: The work is supported by the European Research Council via Synergy Grant 854843—FASTCORR.

In this paper, we focus on the minimization of circuit depth by entangling gates, corresponding to the important time-to-solution metric and the reduction of noise due to decoherence. We consider two popular connectivity maps: Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) and all-to-all. First, we show that a Hadamard-free Clifford operation can be implemented over LNN in depth 5n, i.e., in the same depth as the -CNOT- stage alone. This allows us to implement arbitrary Clifford transformation over LNN in depth no more than 7n − 4, improving the best previous upper bound of 9n. Second, we report heuristic evidence that on average a random uniformly distributed Hadamard-free Clifford transformation over n > 6 qubits can be implemented with only a tiny additive overhead over all-to-all connected architecture compared to the best-known depth-optimized implementation of the -CNOT- stage alone. This suggests the reduction of the depth of Clifford circuits from 2n+O(log2(n)) to 1.5n+O(log2(n)) over unrestricted architectures. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Quantum theory; % reductions; All to alls; ClIFFORD; CNOT gate; Decoherence; Hadamard; Linear nearest neighbors; Minimisation; Quantum phase; Time-to-solution; Timing circuits","","","D.

This process, called quantum circuit mapping, results in a gate/circuit depth overhead that depends on both the circuit properties and the hardware constraints, being the limited qubit connectivity a crucial restriction. In this paper, we propose to extend the characterization of quantum circuits by including qubit interaction graph properties using graph theory-based metrics in addition to previously used circuit-describing parameters. This approach allows for an in-depth analysis and clustering of quantum circuits and a comparison of performance when run on different quantum processors, aiding in developing better mapping techniques. Our study reveals a correlation between interaction graph-based parameters and mapping performance metrics for various existing configurations of quantum devices.

The unknown phase shift inside a Mach–Zehnder interferometer in the presence of photon loss is estimated by simulating the quantum circuits. For this aim, we use the Bayesian approach in which the likelihood functions are needed, and they are obtained by simulating the appropriate quantum circuits. The precision of four different definite photon-number states of light, which all possess six photons, is compared. The measurement scheme that we have considered is counting the number of photons detected after the final beam splitter of the interferometer, and photon loss is modeled by using fictitious beam splitters in the arms of the interferometer. Our results indicate that three of the four definite photon-number states considered can have better precision than the standard interferometry limit whenever the photon loss rate is in a specific range. In addition, the Fisher information for the four definite photon-number states in the setup is also estimated to check the optimality of the chosen measurement scheme. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Zanjan Elites Foundation; Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences, IASBS","Support of Zanjan Elites Foundation and Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS) is acknowledged.","S.

We here reveal such an interference pattern in phase space, which underlies but goes beyond Zitterbewegung, and whose nonclassicality is manifested by the negativity of the phase space quasiprobability distribution, and the associated pseudospin-momentum entanglement. We confirm this discovery by numerical simulation and an on-chip experiment, where a superconducting qubit and a quantized microwave field respectively emulate the internal and external degrees of freedom of a Dirac particle. The measured quasiprobability negativities agree well with the numerical simulation. Besides being of fundamental importance, the demonstrated nonclassical effects are useful in quantum technology. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Numerical models; Phase space methods; Quantum entanglement; Classical systems; Dirac particles; In-phase; Interference patterns; Nonclassicality; Phase spaces; Quantum interference; Quasiprobability distributions; Relativistic quantum mechanics; Zitterbewegung; Degrees of freedom (mechanics)","Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0300200); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11875108, 11934018, 12204105, 12274080, 92065114, T2121001); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDB28000000); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (Z200009); Fuzhou University, FZU, (049050011050, JG202001-2); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B0303030001); Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Fujian Province, (2020J06011)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 12274080, No. 11875108, No. 12204105, No. 11934018, No. 92065114, and No. T2121001), Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology (Grant No. 2021ZD0300200), the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDB28000000), the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province, China (Gran No. 2020B0303030001), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. Z200009), the Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar of Fujian Province under Grant 2020J06011, and Project from Fuzhou University under Grants No. JG202001-2 and No. 049050011050.

The question has been raised as to whether the well-known, low-temperature “glassy anomalies” (attributed to the presence of two-level systems [TLS] and the “boson peak”) persist or not in these ultrastable glasses of much lower configurational entropy. To resolve previous contradictory results, we study a particular type of ultrastable glass, TPD, which can be prepared by physical vapor deposition in a highly-stable state with different degrees of layering and molecular orientation, and also as a conventional glass and in crystalline state. After a thorough characterization of the different samples prepared, we have measured their specific heat down to 0.4 K. Whereas the conventional glass exhibits the typical glassy behaviour and the crystal the expected Debye cubic dependence at very low temperatures, a strong depletion of the TLS contribution is found in both kinds of ultrastable glass, regardless of their layering and molecular ordering. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Molecular orientation; Physical vapor deposition; Specific heat; Temperature; Boson peaks; Configurational entropy; Highly stables; Kinetics and thermodynamics; Lows-temperatures; Molecular ordering; Physical vapour deposition; Stable state; Structural glass; Two-level system; Glass","","","M.A. Ramos; Departamento de Física de la Materia Condensada, Condensed Matter Physics Center (IFIMAC), Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, 28049, Spain; email: miguel.ramos@uam.es","","Nature Research","23993650","","","","English","Commun.

In the context of materials science, an important open problem is the computational description of chemical reactions on surfaces. In this work, we outline a workflow to model the adsorption and reaction of molecules on surfaces using quantum computing algorithms. We develop and compare two local embedding methods for the systematic determination of active spaces. These methods are automated and based on the physics of molecule-surface interactions and yield systematically improvable active spaces. Furthermore, to reduce the quantum resources required for the simulation of the selected active spaces using quantum algorithms, we introduce a technique for exact and automated circuit simplification. This technique is applicable to a broad class of quantum circuits and critical to enable demonstration on near-term quantum devices. We apply the proposed combination of active-space selection and circuit simplification to the dissociation of water on a magnesium surface using classical simulators and quantum hardware. Our study identifies reactions of molecules on surfaces, in conjunction with the proposed algorithmic workflow, as a promising research direction in the field of quantum computing applied to materials science. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Embeddings; Molecules; Quantum theory; Surface reactions; Active spaces; Adsorption and reactions; Computing algorithms; Electronics system; Embedding method; Embeddings; Material science; Quanta computers; Quantum Computing; Work-flows; Quantum computers","","","T.P.

The monolayer diamond grinding wheel with 80/100 mesh size diamond grains was brazed using high-frequency induction techniques. The binarization method was proposed to quantitatively characterize the brittle removed areas from the whole ground surface and oblique polishing method was used to assess the subsurface damage depth of the ground SiC samples. The results show that the maximum undeformed chip thickness (agmax) plays a crucial role in the material removal mode. When agmax increases from 0.08 µm to 1 µm, the brittle-removal ratio increases rapidly from 8.20 % to 48.24 % and the subsurface damage depth increase from 3.48 µm to 9.14 µm by 162.6 %. The grinding wheel speed also has a significant influence on the brittle-removal ratio. With the gradual increase of grinding wheel speed (vs) from 20 m/s to 160 m/s, the brittle-removal ratio of the ground surface decreases from 34.24 % to 25.56 %, and the depth of subsurface damage decreases from 5.68 µm to 3.58 µm by 36.97 %. The effect of the grinding depth on the ground surface and subsurface is comparatively not remarkable. The influence of grinding parameters on the grinding process of SiC ceramics indicate that high speed, creep infeed and deep depth grinding method makes it possible to realize high efficiency and low damage machining for SiC ceramics with monolayer diamond wheel. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Brittle removal ratio; Grinding force; High-efficiency and precision grinding; Monolayer brazed diamond wheel; Subsurface damage depth","Brazing; Diamonds; Efficiency; Grinding (machining); Grinding wheels; Silicon carbide; Brittle removal ratio; Damage depths; Diamond wheel; Grinding force; High efficiency grinding; High-precision; Monolayer brazed diamond wheel; Precision grinding; Removal ratios; Sub-surface damage; Subsurface damage depth; Monolayers","Special fund for scientific and technological innovation and entrepreneurship of Tiandi Science, (2022-2-TD-MS007); Technology Co. ,Ltd.; Technology Co., Ltd.; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52174152); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2020M681761); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province, (BK20210495)","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Jiangsu Province Natural Science Fund ( BK20210495 ), Chinese Postdoctoral Science Foundation ( 2020M681761 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52174152 ), Special fund for scientific and technological innovation and entrepreneurship of Tiandi Science ( 2022-2-TD-MS007 ) and Technology Co. ,Ltd.; Funding text 2: The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Jiangsu Province Natural Science Fund (BK20210495), Chinese Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2020M681761), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52174152), Special fund for scientific and technological innovation and entrepreneurship of Tiandi Science (2022-2-TD-MS007) and Technology Co., Ltd.","Z.

This review presents models that classify states against pairwise particle states |ij〉, given their state transition (ST) probability P|ij〉. A quantum AI (QAI) program, weighs and compares the field's distance between entangled states as qubits from their scalar field of radius R≥|rij|. These states distribute across 〈R〉 with expected probability 〈Pdistribute〉 and measurement outcome 〈M(Pdistribute)〉=P|ij〉. A quantum-classical hybrid model of processors via QAI, classifies and predicts states by decoding qubits into classical bits. For example, a QDF as a quantum field computation model (QFCM) in IBM-QE, performs the doubling of P|ij〉 for a strong state prediction outcome. QFCMs are compared to achieve a universal QFCM (UQFCM). This model is novel in making strong event predictions by simulating systems on any scale using QAI. Its expected measurement fidelity is 〈M(F)〉≥7/5 in classifying states to select 7 optimal QFCMs to predict 〈M〉’s on QFTh observables. This includes QFCMs’ commonality of 〈M〉 against QFCMs limitations in predicting system events. Common measurement results of QFCMs include their expected success probability 〈Psuccess〉 over STs occurring in the system. Consistent results with high F's, are averaged over STs as 〈Pdistribute〉yielding 〈Psuccess〉≥2/3 performed by an SF or QDF of certain QFCMs. A combination of QFCMs with this fidelity level predicts error rates (uncertainties) in measurements, by which a P|ij〉=〈Psuccess〉[Formula presented]1 is weighed as a QAI output to a QFCM user. The user then decides which QFCMs perform a more efficient system simulation as a reliable solution. A UQFCM is useful in predicting system states by preserving and recovering information for intelligent decision support systems in applied, physical, legal and decision sciences, including industry 4.0 systems. © 2023 The Author(s)","Quantum artificial intelligence (QAI); Quantum field computation model (QFCM); Quantum field theory (QFTh); Quantum Fourier transform (QFT); Quantum simulator; Qubit; Success probability; Transition probability; Universal QFCM","","University of Victoria, UVic, (2015-2023, V00766282)","This work was supported by the University of Victoria , Canada, for financial support, award no.

While claims of quantum speed-up have been announced for gate-based quantum computers and photon-based boson samplers, demonstration of an advantage by adiabatic quantum annealers (AQAs) is open. Here we quantify the computational cost and the performance of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), a widely investigated machine learning model, by classical and quantum annealing. Despite the lower computational complexity of the quantum RBM being lost due to physical implementation overheads, a quantum speed-up may arise as a reduction by orders of magnitude of the computational time. By employing real-world cybersecurity datasets, we observe that the negative phase on sufficiently challenging tasks is computed up to 64 times faster by AQAs during the exploitation phase. Therefore, although a quantum speed-up highly depends on the problem’s characteristics, it emerges in existing hardware on real-world data. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Anomaly detection; Qubits; Anomaly detection; Computational costs; Detection speed; Hard task; Machine-learning; Quanta computers; Quantum machines; Real-world; Restricted boltzmann machine; Speed up; Machine learning","CINECA; Vista Technology SRL, (PSR2021DIP008)","Funding text 1: This research has been partially funded by Vista Technology SRL.

Coupling noise among inductors, routing striplines, and bias microstriplines within SFQ circuits degrade performance while decreasing margins. In this article, inductive and capacitive coupling between the different layers are characterized. Inductive coupling models between different layers in the MIT LL SFQ5ee process match experimental data within 3%. The dependence of inductive coupling on the thickness of the oxide and metal layer is also discussed. An understanding of inductive and capacitive coupling can determine the minimum physical distance between lines. In addition, tradeoffs exist among inductive coupling, capacitive coupling, layout complexity, and the vias between ground layers.

They provide a nonnumerical pathway to solving partial differential equations by expressing the field solution as an artificial neural network. This approach has been applied successfully to various types of differential equations. A major area of research on PINNs is the application to coupled partial differential equations in particular, and a general breakthrough is still lacking. In coupled equations, the optimization operates in a critical conflict between boundary conditions and the underlying equations, which often requires either many iterations or complex schemes to avoid trivial solutions and to achieve convergence. We provide empirical evidence for the mitigation of bad initial conditioning in PINNs for solving one-dimensional consolidation problems of porous media through the introduction of affine transformations after the classical output layer of artificial neural network architectures, effectively accelerating the training process. These affine physics-informed neural networks (AfPINNs) then produce nontrivial and accurate field solutions even in parameter spaces with diverging orders of magnitude. On average, AfPINNs show the ability to improve the L2 relative error by 64.84 % after 25,000 epochs for a one-dimensional consolidation problem based on Biot’s theory, and an average improvement by 58.80 % with a transfer approach to the theory of porous media. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","affine transform; article; artificial neural network; mitigation; physics; theoretical study","QuaLiPerF, (504766766); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (390740016, 436883643, 465194077, EXC 2075/1, PN 2-2A); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (031L0304A)","L.M. and T.R. are funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) by grant number 465194077 (Priority Programme SPP 2311, Project SimLivA).

Compared to Wheeler’s criterion for inferring past particle paths, as used in prior protocols, our trace criterion provides stronger support for the claim of the counterfactuality of the communication. We verify the lack of trace left by transmitted photons via tagging the propagation arms of an interferometric device by distinct frequency-shifts and finding that the collected photons have no frequency shift which corresponds to the transmission channel. As a proof of principle, we counterfactually transfer a quick response code image with sufficient fidelity to be scanned with a cell phone. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Transmissions; Communications protocols; Counterfactuals; Experimental realizations; Frequency shift; Interferometrics; Particle paths; S-criterion; Shift-and; Trace criterion; Transmission channels; Photons","Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies, (AHY020100); Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0301200); National Science Foundation, NSF, (1915015); Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-18-1-0178); United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation, BSF, (735/18); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11804330, 11821404, 12022401, 12204142, 12204468, 62075207); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province, (2208085QA13); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, YIPA CAS, (2020447); Anhui Provincial Department of Education, (KJ2021A0917); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (WK2470000026, WK2470000030)","This work was supported by the Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology (No. 2021ZD0301200), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 12022401, 62075207, 11821404, 11804330, 12204142, 12204468), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. WK2470000026, WK2470000030), the CAS Youth Innovation Promotion Association (No. 2020447), Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies (Grant No. AHY020100), the Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation (No. 2208085QA13), the Key Program of the Education Department of Anhui Province (No. KJ2021A0917) and the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation (Grant No. 735/18).

The two dominant phases in the diagram are the quantum spin-liquid (QSL) and the antiferromagnetic Ising order. Quantum correlations suggest that the QSL phase is likely to exhibit entanglement. To explore this possibility, we utilized numerical Lanczos and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to calculate concurrence, quantum discord (QD), and entanglement entropy. The results of our study indicate the existence of quantum entanglement within the intermediate region, implying a greater probability for the dominance of the quantum spin-liquid (QSL) phase over the antiferromagnetic Ising order. This discovery underscores the importance of considering quantum correlations in comprehending the model’s behavior and provides insight into the complex nature of quantum systems. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; entropy; probability","","","S.

Due to the reduced occupied area, highly low power consumption, and extremely high speed of quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) technology, it is one of the finest alternatives to complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology for nanoscale construction of circuits. On the other hand, fault tolerance becomes crucial in QCA due to the inherent sensitivity of quantum dots to various sources of errors and faults. These errors can arise from environmental disturbances, manufacturing imperfections, thermal fluctuations, and other factors. The presence of defects or faults can significantly impact the functionality and accuracy of QCA systems, leading to incorrect computation or signal corruption. To address these challenges, fault-tolerant structures are designed in QCA systems. These structures are specifically engineered to detect, tolerate, and mitigate the effects of faults, thereby enhancing the reliability and robustness of QCA-based computation. Fault-tolerant designs aim to ensure that the system can continue to operate correctly even in the presence of defects or faults. In QCA, proposed a fault-tolerant majority gate is necessary to ensure reliable computation in the presence of defects or faults. The fault-tolerant majority gate is a fundamental component in digital logic circuits, and it plays a crucial role in performing computations. It takes multiple input signals and produces an output based on the majority of those inputs. In classical computing, the majority gates are typically implemented using transistors. Therefore, this paper introduces a new and efficient fault-tolerant 3-input majority voter (FT MV3) using 11 simple and rotated cells in the QCA technology, which is 100% and 90.47% tolerant against single-cell and double-cell omission defects. The recommended FT MV3 gate verification is confirmed using some physical proofs. Afterward, to illustrate the performance of the introduced gate, three fault-tolerant computational circuits, including multiplexer, adder and ALU, are presented using the introduced FT MV3 gate. The comparison of the proposed fault tolerant ALU to the best coplanar design shows a 28.80% and 34.01% reduction of cell count and occupied area, respectively. All circuits are simulated using QCADesigner 2.0.3 software. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Fault-tolerant; Full-adder; Nanotechnology; Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA)","Cells; Cellular automata; Computer circuits; Cytology; Delay circuits; Electric power utilization; Fault tolerance; Logic circuits; Low power electronics; Nanocrystals; Semiconductor quantum dots; Timing circuits; Area Power Consumption; Automaton system; Fault-tolerant; Full adders; Logical circuit; Majority gates; Majority voter; Nano scale; Quantum-dot cellular automata; Quantum-dot cellular automaton; Adders","","","M.

Rydberg atom arrays constitute one of the most rapidly developing arenas for quantum simulation and quantum computing. The Z2 LGT and topological order has been realized in experiments while the U(1) LGT is being worked hard on the way. States of LGT have local constraints and are fragmented into several winding sectors with topological protection. It is therefore difficult to reach the ground state in target sector for experiments, and it is also an important task for quantum topological memory. Here, we propose a protocol of sweeping quantum annealing (SQA) for searching the ground state among topological sectors. With the quantum Monte Carlo method, we show that this SQA has linear time complexity of size with applications to the antiferromagnetic transverse field Ising model, which has emergent U(1) gauge fields. This SQA protocol can be realized easily on quantum simulation platforms such as Rydberg array and D-wave annealer. We expect this approach would provide an efficient recipe for resolving the topological hindrances in quantum optimization and the preparation of quantum topological state. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Ising model; Monte Carlo methods; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Simulation platform; Topology; Atom arrays; Lattice gauge theory; Quantum annealing; Quantum device; Quantum optimization; Quantum simulations; Quantum simulators; Rydberg atoms; Simulation computing; Theory model; Ground state","Beijing PARATERA Tech Co., Ltd.; RGC; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR of China, (17301420, 17301721, 17309822, AoE/P-701/20); Westlake University; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (A_HKU703/22); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11874094, 12104098, 12274046); Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LZ23A040003); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing Municipality, (CSTB2022NSCQ-JQX0018); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2021CDJZYJH-003)","Funding text 1: We especially acknowledge Xiaopeng Li for useful discussions and suggestions.

Each platform requires bespoke strategies to maximise the efficiency of the quantum/classical interface when operating close to the qubits. At a higher level, however, a shared interface allowing portability of quantum algorithms across all the available quantum platforms is preferred. Striking the right balance between portability and performance of the algorithm as implemented on quantum hardware remains a major challenge for this field. Here, we propose a quantum hardware abstraction layer (QHAL) providing a multi-level intermediate representation of the quantum stack. A collaborative effort between software specialists and quantum hardware developers operating on four major qubit technologies (photonics, silicon, superconducting and trapped ions) led to the identification of a minimum common set of instructions and metadata allowing the QHAL to interact efficiently with multiple platforms. Access to the stack from the higher levels increases latency yet minimises the amount of hardware architecture parameters to be handled by the algorithm developer, thus simplifying code development and reducing security threats from misuse or malicious access for hardware developers. Access to the stack from the lowest—closest to the qubits—level provides the highest hardware responsiveness, suitable for algorithms requiring minimum latency for data and instruction transfer. With respect to existing quantum assembly languages, the QHAL extends further down in the stack by defining an application-binary interface to interact with the quantum hardware. By defining a standard representation of the quantum stack, a common reference framework is provided to both software and hardware developers which would ensure future integration of their R&D efforts. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","Abstracting; Computer hardware; Quantum theory; Qubits; Trapped ions; Computing platform; Hardware Abstraction Layers; Intermediate representations; Multilevels; Performance; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum-classical; Shared interfaces; Efficiency","Can Nur and Louise Aherne; Oxford Quantum Circuits team; Universal Quantum; Innovate UK, (48482); National Physical Laboratory, NPL","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Innovate UK for funding the NISQ.OS project (48482) which brought the consortium members together.

We present a novel theoretical model characterizing errors from various sources in practical phase encoding-based QKD systems, namely the laser linewidth, detector dark counts, and channel dispersion. This model provides optimized optical pulse parameters and less distortion in pulses, which eliminates system imperfections and leads to a reduced quantum bit error rate (QBER) for practical QKD scenario. This analysis is applicable to various fiber-based phase and time encoding protocols. In particular, we implement this to a differential phase shift (DPS) QKD scheme operating at a 2.5 GHz clock, which produces a secure key rate of 193 bits/s at a fiber length of 265 km and an unprecedented QBER < 1 % up to 225 km length with standard telecom components. We show that by adjusting the quantum efficiency and dark count rates of detectors, proposed system can establish secure keys up to 380 km distance using standard telecom grade fiber with a QBER of 1.48%.

Nevertheless, machine learning models used in modern image recognition systems consist of millions of parameters that usually require significant computational time to be adjusted. Moreover, adjustment of model hyperparameters leads to additional overhead. Because of this, new developments in machine learning models and hyperparameter optimization techniques are required. This paper presents a quantum-inspired hyperparameter optimization technique and a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning model for supervised learning. We benchmark our hyperparameter optimization method over standard black-box objective functions and observe performance improvements in the form of reduced expected run times and fitness in response to the growth in the size of the search space. We test our approaches in a car image classification task and demonstrate a full-scale implementation of the hybrid quantum ResNet model with the tensor train hyperparameter optimization. Our tests show a qualitative and quantitative advantage over the corresponding standard classical tabular grid search approach used with a deep neural network ResNet34. A classification accuracy of 0.97 was obtained by the hybrid model after 18 iterations, whereas the classical model achieved an accuracy of 0.92 after 75 iterations. © 2023, The Author(s).","Computer vision and pattern recognition; Hybrid quantum computing; Hybrid quantum machine learning; Hybrid quantum neural networks; Hyperparameter optimisation; Image classification; Machine learning; Tensor train optimisation","Benchmarking; Computer vision; Deep neural networks; Image recognition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum computers; Tensors; Computer vision and pattern recognition; Hybrid quantum computing; Hybrid quantum machine learning; Hybrid quantum neural network; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Images classification; Machine-learning; Optimisations; Quantum Computing; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Tensor train optimization; Tensor trains; Image classification","","","A.

Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the OUP based on multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) manifests excellent robustness against various deviations in the waveguide geometries and the operation wavelength.

Many healthcare centers have adopted IoT-based devices such as heart monitoring implants and Electrocardiograms (ECG) for continuous patient monitoring in and out of hospitals. However, due to open Internet connectivity and lack of authentication, these devices may lead to several life-threatening risks. Recent advancements in Quantum Computing threatened the security of classical cryptographic primitives such as the RSA algorithm. The security and privacy of patient data are of utmost importance and are to be protected from existing vulnerabilities and futuristic Quantum attacks. Motivated by the abovementioned issues, we proposed the QSMAH protocol which ensures secure Key Agreement (KA) and Mutual Authentication (MA) based on Quantum Cryptography. Unlike classical authentication schemes, in our protocol, Quantum Teleportation and Quantum Entanglement are effectively utilized for secure data transfer among entities. The security of the proposed QSMAH protocol relies on a Quantum Key and Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states to achieve strong authentication. An extensive formal security analysis using BAN logic is provided to prove the goal of our protocol. The simulation of the proposed protocol is provided using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA). The results reflect that the security of our protocol cannot be tampered with by Quantum Shor's and Grover's algorithms. The security analysis proves that QSMAH is also resistant to classical attacks and futuristic Quantum attacks on cryptographic schemes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","GHZ state; Healthcare; Internet of things (IoT); Mutual authentication; Quantum Key Distribution(QKD); Quantum teleportation","","","","P.S.

Currently, the lack of scalability limits the logical encoding in most physical systems, and thus the high scalability of propagating light can be a game changer. However, propagating light also has difficulty in logical encoding due to weak nonlinearity. Here, we propose a synthesizer that encodes Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits in propagating light by exploiting the nonlinearity of photon detectors. This synthesizer is based on an approach what we call Gaussian breeding, leading to the following four advantages: (i) systematic and rigorous synthesis of arbitrary GKP qubits, (ii) use of minimal resources, (iii) high fidelity and high success probability, and (iv) robustness against loss. There has been no protocol that incorporates all these advantages, and thus the proposed synthesizer excels in both performance and feasibility. By employing our method, one can generate GKP qubits using a few to several squeezed light sources, beam splitters and photon detectors. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Encoding (symbols); Gaussian beams; Light sources; Particle beams; Quantum optics; Qubits; Scalability; Signal encoding; Encodings; Gaussians; High scalabilities; Logical encoding; Logical qubits; Photon detector; Physical systems; Quantum Computing; Quantum Information; Weak nonlinearity; Photons","EU/BMBF; Forefront Physics and Mathematics Program; ShoQC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (429529648 - TRR 306 QuCoLiMa); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (18H05207, 20K15187, 22K20351); Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (JPMJMS2064); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; University of Tokyo Foundation, UTF","This work was partly supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (18H05207, 20K15187, and 22K20351), the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JPMJMS2064), the BMBF in Germany (QR.X and PhotonQ), the EU/BMBF via QuantERA (ShoQC), and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) - Project-ID 429529648 - TRR 306 QuCoLiMa (""Quantum Cooperativity of Light and Matter”).

Quantum benchmarking provides key information on noise properties and is an important step for developing more advanced quantum processors. However, current benchmarking methods are either limited to a specific subset of quantum gates or cannot directly describe the performance of the individual target gate. To overcome these limitations, we propose channel spectrum benchmarking (CSB), a method to infer the noise properties of the target gate, including process fidelity, stochastic fidelity, and some unitary parameters, from the eigenvalues of its noisy channel. Our CSB method is insensitive to state-preparation and measurement errors, and importantly, can benchmark universal gates and is scalable to many-qubit systems. Unlike standard randomized schemes, CSB can provide direct noise information for both target native gates and circuit fragments, allowing benchmarking and calibration of global entangling gates and frequently used modules in quantum algorithms like Trotterized Hamiltonian evolution operator in quantum simulation. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","benchmarking; calibration; information; noise; quantum mechanics; simulation; spectrum; algorithm; article; benchmarking; calibration; controlled study; human; measurement error; noise; randomized controlled trial; simulation; stochastic model","Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0302400); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11974198, 12147123); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (Z220002)","This work was supported by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No. Z220002), the Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology (Grant No. 2021ZD0302400), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 12147123 and 11974198).

A promising way to bridge these widely different frequencies is using high-frequency nanomechanical resonators interacting with low-loss optical modes. State-of-the-art optomechanical devices rely on purely dispersive interactions that are enhanced by a large photon population in the cavity. Additionally, one could use dissipative optomechanics, where photons can be scattered directly from a waveguide into a resonator hence increasing the degree of control of the acousto-optic interplay. Hitherto, such dissipative optomechanical interaction was only demonstrated at low mechanical frequencies, precluding prominent applications such as the quantum state transfer between photonic and phononic domains. Here, we show the first dissipative optomechanical system operating in the sideband-resolved regime, where the mechanical frequency is larger than the optical linewidth. Exploring this unprecedented regime, we demonstrate the impact of dissipative optomechanical coupling in reshaping both mechanical and optical spectra. Our figures represent a two-order-of-magnitude leap in the mechanical frequency and a tenfold increase in the dissipative optomechanical coupling rate compared to previous works. Further advances could enable the individual addressing of mechanical modes and help mitigate optical nonlinearities and absorption in optomechanical devices. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","absorption; equipment; frequency analysis; mechanical property; microwave radiation; quantum mechanics; article; nonlinear system; optomechanics; photon","European Research Council, ERC, (101001005); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (18/15577-5, 18/15580-6, 18/25339-4, 19/01402-1, 19/09738-9, 20/15786-3, 22/07719-0); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschap, OCW, (680-92-18-04); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","This work was supported by São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) through grants 19/09738-9, 20/15786-3, 19/01402-1, 18/15577-5, 18/15580-6, 18/25339-4, 22/07719-0, Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brasil (CAPES) (Finance Code 001), the European Research Council (ERC CoG Q-ECHOS, 101001005), and by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO/OCW), as part of the Frontiers of Nanoscience program, as well as through Vrij Programma (680-92-18-04).

In this work, we synthesized and characterized a fluorescent probe called THS, which untilizes diphenylamine (DPA) as a metal chelator and an arylimidazole-derived organic chromophore as a fluorescence signal reporter. A comparative assessment of responsive THS and its Zn(II) complex to lipase, an enzyme that breaks down fats, has been performed. We have evidenced the complexation of Zn(II) improved the sensing stability, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and selectivity of THS toward lipase.

Progress has been hindered by the challenges of realizing scalable, high quality, ultrasmooth metal deposition strategies, and by the poor pattern transfer and device fabrication yields characteristic of most metal deposition approaches which yield polycrystalline metal structure. Here we highlight a novel and scalable electrochemical method to deposit ultrasmooth, single-crystal (100) gold and to fabricate a series of bowtie nanoantennas through subtractive nanopatterning. We investigate some of the less well-explored design and performance characteristics of these single-crystal nanoantennas in relation to their polycrystalline counterparts, including pattern transfer and device yield, polarization response, gap-field magnitude, and the ability to model accurately the antenna local field response. Our results underscore the performance advantages of single-crystal nanoscale plasmonic materials and provide insight into their use for large-scale manufacturing of plasmon-based devices. We anticipate that this approach will be broadly useful in applications where local near-fields can enhance light–matter interactions, including for the fabrication of optical sensors, photocatalytic structures, hot carrier-based devices, and nanostructured noble metal architectures targeting nano-attophysics. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","MNT; CMC Microsystems, CMC; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2017-06882); Western Economic Diversification Canada, WD; Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI, (7353, 8140); Simon Fraser University, SFU; British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund, BCKDF, (147C)","This work is supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (RGPIN-2017-06882) and CMC Microsystems (MNT Financial Assistance Program).

There have been many different proposals on how classical data can be encoded and what circuit ansätze and measurement operators should be used to process the encoded data and measure the output state of an ansatz. The choice of the aforementioned operators plays a determinant role in the expressive power of the QML model. In this work we investigate how certain changes in the circuit structure change this expressivity. We introduce both numerical and analytical tools to explore the effect that these operators have in the overall performance of the QML model. These tools are based on previous work on the teacher-student scheme, the partial Fourier series and the averaged operator size. We focus our analysis on simple QML models with two and three qubits and observe that increasing the number of parameterized and entangling gates leads to a more expressive model for certain circuit structures. Also, on which qubit the measurement is performed affects the type of functions that QML models could learn. This work sketches the determinant role that the processing and measurement operators have on the expressive power of simple quantum circuits. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Machine learning; Quantum neural networks; Variational quantum circuits","Electric network analysis; Fourier series; Qubits; Timing circuits; Circuit structures; Expressive power; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Quantum circuit; Quantum machines; Quantum models; Quantum neural networks; Simple++; Variational quantum circuit; Machine learning","European Social Fund FEDER; Proyectos de I+D+I, (QUSPIN RTC2019-007196-7); Fundación Cellex; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (847517); Family Process Institute, FPI, (PCI2022-132919); European Research Council, ERC; Generalitat de Catalunya; Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca, AGAUR, (2017 SGR 134, U16-011424); Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (2016/20/W/ST4/00314); Horizon 2020, (899794); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI, (CEX2019-000910-S, FIDEUA PID2019-106901GB-I00, MCIN/ AEI/10.13039/501100011033); Fundación Mig-Puig","ICFO group acknowledges support from: ERC AdG NOQIA; Agencia Estatal de Investigación (R &D project CEX2019-000910-S, funded by MCIN/ AEI/10.13039/501100011033, Plan National FIDEUA PID2019-106901GB-I00, FPI, QUANTERA MAQS PCI2019-111828-2, QUANTERA DYNAMITE PCI2022-132919, Proyectos de I+D+I “Retos Colaboración” QUSPIN RTC2019-007196-7), MCIN via European Union NextGenerationEU (PRTR); Fundació Cellex; Fundació Mir-Puig; Generalitat de Catalunya through the European Social Fund FEDER and CERCA program (AGAUR Grant No. 2017 SGR 134, QuantumCAT U16-011424, co-funded by ERDF Operational Program of Catalonia 2014–2020); EU Horizon 2020 FET-OPEN OPTOlogic (Grant No 899794); National Science Centre, Poland (Symfonia Grant No. 2016/20/W/ST4/00314); European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 847517.

The age at onset, disease severity, and rate of progression vary significantly among patients. This disease is classified into severe or mild forms depending on neurological symptom involvement. The severe form is associated with progressive cognitive decline while the mild form is predominantly associated with somatic features. Newborn screening (NBS) for MPS II has been performed since December 2016, mainly in Kyushu, Japan, where 197,700 newborns were screened using a fluorescence enzyme activity assay of dried blood spots. We diagnosed one newborn with MPS II with lower IDS activity, elevated urinary glycosaminoglycans, and a novel variant of the IDS gene. In the future, NBS for MPS II is expected to be performed in many regions of Japan and will contribute to the detection of more patients with MPS II, which is crucial to the early treatment of the disorder. © 2023 The Author(s)","Enzyme replacement therapy; Hunter syndrome; Iduronate-2-sulfatase; Mucopolysaccharidosis type II; Newborn screening","glycosaminoglycan; iduronate 2 sulfatase; uronic acid; abnormal value; Article; controlled study; dried blood spot testing; enzyme activity; enzyme replacement; female; fluorescence analysis; gene frequency; genetic variability; human; Hunter syndrome; Japan; major clinical study; male; newborn; newborn screening; pediatric patient; urinalysis; urine level","Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, AMED, (JP19ek0109276, JP20ek0109482); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP23K07294, JP23K07316, JP23K14954); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT; Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, MHLW, (JPMH20FC1025)","This study was supported in part by a Health and Labor Sciences Research Grant for Research on Rare and Intractable Diseases from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan (grant number JPMH20FC1025 ); a Grant-in-Aid for Practical Research Project for Rare/Intractable Diseases from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED; grant numbers JP19ek0109276 , JP20ek0109482 ); and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JSPS] KAKENHI: grant number JP23K07294 , JP23K07316 , JP23K14954 ).

In particular, these spin defects have shown promise as sensors for temperature, pressure, and static magnetic fields. However, their short spin coherence time limits their scope for quantum technology. Here, we apply dynamical decoupling techniques to suppress magnetic noise and extend the spin coherence time by two orders of magnitude, approaching the fundamental T 1 relaxation limit. Based on this improvement, we demonstrate advanced spin control and a set of quantum sensing protocols to detect radiofrequency signals with sub-Hz resolution. The corresponding sensitivity is benchmarked against that of state-of-the-art NV-diamond quantum sensors. This work lays the foundation for nanoscale sensing using spin defects in an exfoliable material and opens a promising path to quantum sensors and quantum networks integrated into ultra-thin structures. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","boron; quantum dot; boron; noise; quantum mechanics; Article; benchmarking; controlled study; magnetism; radiofrequency","NQSTI; National Quantum Science and Technology Institute; NextGenerationEU, (2022-RTDA-4445); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (412351169, RI 3319/1-1); Università di Bologna, UNIBO, (2022, EXC-2111 390814868, Strategy-EXC 2089/1-390776260); Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Wissenschaft und Kunst, STMWK","R.R. and D.B.B. would like to thank Dr. Steffen Glaser for stimulating discussions.

These optical beams also suffer from spatial aberrations due to atmospheric turbulence and unfavorable weather conditions. Consequently, we introduce a measurement device-independent quantum key distribution implemented with vector vortex modes. We study the transmission of vector vortex and scalar beams through a turbulent atmospheric link under diverse weather conditions such as rain or haze. We demonstrate that a maximum secure key transmission distance of 178 km can be achieved under clear conditions by utilizing the vector vortex beams, which have been mainly ignored in the literature. When raindrops have a diameter of 6 mm and fog particles have a radius of 0.5 μ m, the signals can reach 152 km and 160 km, respectively. Since these distances are comparable, this work sheds light into the feasibility of implementing measurement device-independent quantum key distribution using vector vortex modes under diverse weather conditions. Most significantly, this opens the door to practical secure quantum communications. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; feasibility study; haze; weather","","","M.

Differences between sequences are identified through comparative approaches like sequence analysis, where variations can occur at the individual nucleotide level or collectively due to various phenomena such as recombination or deletion. Detecting these sequence differences is vital for understanding biology and medicine, but the complexity and size of genomic data require substantial classical computing power. Inspired by human visual perception and pixel representation on quantum computers, we leverage these techniques to implement pairwise sequence analysis. Our method utilizes the Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) framework, enabling comparisons at a fine granularity to single letters or amino acids within gene sequences. This novel approach enhances accuracy and resolution, surpassing traditional methods by capturing subtle genetic variations with precision. In summary, our approach offers algorithmic advantages, including reduced time complexity, improved space efficiency, and accurate sequence comparisons. The novelty lies in applying the FRQI algorithm to compare quantum images in genome sequencing, allowing for examination at the individual letter or amino acid level. This breakthrough holds promise for advancing biological data analysis and enables a more comprehensive understanding of genetic information. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Algorithms; Amino Acids; Antifibrinolytic Agents; Chromosome Mapping; Computers; Humans; Nucleotides; amino acid; antifibrinolytic agent; nucleotide; algorithm; chromosomal mapping; human","CERN","M.G. is supported by CERN through CERN Quantum Technology Initiative.

There are different reversible algorithms for quantum computation and many quantum circuits theoretically designed until now. These designs are only built from reversible gates because reversibility is a necessary logic in quantum circuits. Additionally, ternary representation can allow designing a circuit with fewer inputs and outputs, leading to a considerable decline in size or number of qutrits. Although other papers in quantum ternary reversible logic are in unbalanced representation, this paper, for the first time, considers balanced ternary advantages to achieve a more efficient design for quantum multipliers as the main component in arithmetic blocks. Six criteria are introduced to show how balanced representation increases the overall performance. In this work, two general balanced ternary adder blocks (full-adder and half-adder) and two balanced ternary partial product generators (BTPPGs) are proposed, and also a 2 × 2 and a 3 × 3 balanced ternary multipliers built from these components. The quantum costs of proposed balanced ternary multipliers enhanced 17% for a 2 × 2 multiplier and 34% for a 3 × 3 multiplier. © 2023","Quantum Computing; Quantum Ternary Gates; Reversible Logic; Sustainable Computing","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Electron multipliers; Logic gates; Quantum computers; Quantum efficiency; Building blockes; Input and outputs; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum ternary gate; Qutrits; Reversible gates; Reversible Logic; Sustainable computing; Ternary representation; Adders","","","K.

Recent work suggests that spatial noise correlations can be harnessed as a resource for noise mitigation via the use of spectator qubits to measure environmental noise. In this work we generalize this concept from spectator qubits to a spectator mode: a photonic mode which continuously measures spatially correlated classical dephasing noise and applies a continuous correction drive to frequency-tunable data qubits. Our analysis shows that by using many photon states, spectator modes can surpass many of the quantum measurement constraints that limit spectator qubit approaches. We also find that long-time data qubit dephasing can be arbitrarily suppressed, even for white noise dephasing. Further, using a squeezing (parametric) drive, the error in the spectator mode approach can exhibit Heisenberg-limited scaling in the number of photons used. We also show that spectator mode noise mitigation can be implemented completely autonomously using engineered dissipation. In this case no explicit measurement or processing of a classical measurement record is needed. Our work establishes spectator modes as a potentially powerful alternative to spectator qubits for noise mitigation. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Photons; Qubits; White noise; Continuous measurements; Data qubit; Dephasing; Environmental noise; Heisenberg; Noise correlation; Noise mitigation; Photonic modes; Quantum state; Spatial noise; Digital storage","Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-19-1-0380); Simons Foundation, SF, (669487)","This work was supported by the Army Research Office under Grant No. W911NF-19-1-0380.

While its iterative process systematically reaches the ground state energy, practical implementations of ADAPT-VQE are sensitive to local energy minima, leading to over-parameterized ansätze. We introduce the Overlap-ADAPT-VQE to grow wave-functions by maximizing their overlap with any intermediate target wave-function that already captures some electronic correlation. By avoiding building the ansatz in the energy landscape strewn with local minima, the Overlap-ADAPT-VQE produces ultra-compact ansätze suitable for high-accuracy initialization of a new ADAPT procedure. Significant advantages over ADAPT-VQE are observed for strongly correlated systems including substantial savings in circuit depth. Since this compression strategy can also be initialized with accurate Selected-Configuration Interaction (SCI) classical target wave-functions, it paves the way for chemically accurate simulations of larger systems, and strengthens the promise of decisively surpassing classical quantum chemistry through the power of quantum computing. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Ground state; Iterative methods; Quantum computers; Wave functions; Chemical systems; Classical simulation; Ground-state energies; Iterative process; Local energy minima; Quanta computers; Quantum chemical; Quantum-classical; Robust algorithm; Target waves; Quantum chemistry","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (810367, ANR-22-PETQ-0007); European Research Council, ERC","Funding text 1: This work has been funded in part by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant No. 810367), project EMC2 (J.-P.P. and Y.M.).

In this paper, we propose a new quantum image representation of RGB images with deterministic image retrieval, which is an improvement over all the similar existing representations in terms of using minimum resource. We use two entangled quantum registers constituting of total 7 qutrits to encode the color channels and their intensities. Additionally, we generalize the existing encoding methods by using both qubits and qutrits to encode the pixel positions of a rectangular image. This hybrid-qudit approach aligns well with the current progress of NISQ devices in incorporating higher dimensional quantum systems than qubits. We then describe the image encoding method using higher-order qubit-qutrit gates, and demonstrate the decomposition of these gates in terms of simpler elementary gates. We use the Google Cirq’s quantum simulator to verify the image preparation in both the ideal noise-free scenario and in presence of realistic noise modelling. We show that the complexity of the image encoding process is linear in the number of pixels.

While optical fibre communications are range-limited due to exponential losses in the absence of quantum memories and repeaters, satellites enable intercontinental quantum communications. However, the design of satellite quantum key distribution (SatQKD) systems has unique challenges over terrestrial networks. The typical approach to modelling SatQKD has been to estimate performances with a fully optimised protocol parameter space and with few payload and platform resource limitations. Here, we analyse how practical constraints affect the performance of SatQKD for the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) weak coherent pulse decoy state protocol with finite key size effects. We consider engineering limitations and trade-offs in mission design including limited in-orbit tunability, quantum random number generation rates and storage, and source intensity uncertainty.

Our work may open up an alternative approach to the simultaneous ground state cooling and quantum synchronization of multiple resonators, which has fewer parametric limitations. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ground state cooling; Optoelectromechanical system; Quantum synchronization","Cooling; Ground state; Quantum theory; Resonant circuits; Resonators; Synchronization; Ground state cooling; Lower frequencies; Mechanical; Mechanical frequency; Mechanical resonators; Optoelectromechanical systems; Quantum synchronization; Radio frequency resonators; Simultaneous cooling; Voltage modulations; Bias voltage","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12074094, 12074330, 62071412)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants No. 12074330, No. 62071412, and No. 12074094.

An emerging set of proposals seeks to use arrays of optomechanical sensors to detect weak distributed forces, for applications ranging from gravity-based subterranean imaging to dark matter searches; however, a detailed investigation into the quantum-enhancement of this approach remains outstanding. Here, we propose an array of entanglement-enhanced optomechanical sensors to improve the broadband sensitivity of distributed force sensing. By coherently operating the optomechanical sensor array and distributing squeezing to entangle the optical fields, the array of sensors has a scaling advantage over independent sensors (i.e., M→M , where M is the number of sensors) due to coherence as well as joint noise suppression due to multi-partite entanglement. As an illustration, we consider entanglement-enhancement of an optomechanical accelerometer array to search for dark matter, and elucidate the challenge of realizing a quantum advantage in this context. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Dark Matter; Gravitation; Optomechanics; Quantum entanglement; Array of sensors; Dark matter searches; Distributed forces; Force sensing; Independent sensors; Noise suppression; Optical field; Opto-mechanical sensors; Scalings; Sensors array; Galaxies","National Quantum Information Science Research Centers; Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems Center, (DE-AC02-07CH11359); National Science Foundation, NSF, (CCF-2142882); Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-18-1-2370); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (1941583, N660012014029, OIA-2040575, OIA-2134830); John Templeton Foundation, JTF, (2209473); Office of Science, SC; Northwestern University, NU","This work is supported by NSF CAREER Award CCF-2142882, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Young Faculty Award (YFA) Grant No. N660012014029, NSF Engineering Research Center for Quantum Networks Grant No. 1941583, NSF OIA-2134830 and NSF OIA-2040575, and U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, National Quantum Information Science Research Centers, Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems Center (SQMS) under the contract No. DE-AC02-07CH11359.

These tend to be hierarchical, modular and exhibit repeating patterns. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) attempts to automate neural network design through learning network architecture and achieves state-of-the-art performance. We propose a framework for representing quantum circuit architectures using techniques from NAS, which enables search space design and architecture search. We use this framework to justify the importance of circuit architecture in quantum machine learning by generating a family of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) and evaluating them on a music genre classification dataset, GTZAN. Furthermore, we employ a genetic algorithm to perform Quantum Phase Recognition (QPR) as an example of architecture search with our representation.

Herein, we developed a metallofullerene-based nano spin sensor to probe gas adsorption within porous organic frameworks. For this, spin-active metallofullerene, Sc3C2@C80, was selected and embedded into a nanopore of a pyrene-based covalent organic framework (Py-COF). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy recorded the EPR signals of Sc3C2@C80 within Py-COF after adsorbing N2, CO, CH4, CO2, C3H6, and C3H8. Results indicated that the regularly changing EPR signals of embedded Sc3C2@C80 were associated with the gas adsorption performance of Py-COF. In contrast to traditional adsorption isotherm measurements, this implantable nano spin sensor could probe gas adsorption and desorption with in situ, real-time monitoring. The proposed nano spin sensor was also employed to probe the gas adsorption performance of a metal–organic framework (MOF-177), demonstrating its versatility. The nano spin sensor is thus applicable for quantum sensing and precision measurements. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","carbon dioxide; metal organic framework; nanochain; propane; pyrene; adsorption; isotherm; porous medium; sensor; adsorption; Article; covalent bond; desorption; electron spin resonance; isotherm","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51972309, 52022098); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, YIPA CAS, (Y201910)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52022098, 51972309) and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Y201910).

Typically, these experiments are conducted at low cryogenic temperatures, utilizing spin systems embedded within a high-quality (Q-factor) superconducting cavity. Recent studies indicate that under these conditions, especially in a high-cooperativity regime with strong collective coupling between an electron spin system and a microwave cavity, multiple spin echoes can be detected. These echoes are interpreted as manifestations of coherent quantum effects. To put it simply, photons within the cavity can excite the spin system, which subsequently can stimulate the cavity, creating a feedback loop. In our research, we demonstrate that a specially designed moderate-Q cavity, paired with diamond crystals rich in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, allows us to observe such nonlinear quantum phenomena, even at ambient temperatures. Crucially, our experimental design necessitates amplifying the net number of spins for a specific, limited spin concentration. This is achieved by lowering the spins' thermodynamic temperature (as opposed to their physical temperature) to a few kelvins. Notably, we find that maintaining high cooperativity or strong coupling is not essential for these observations. The potential to observe significant microwave cavity quantum effects at room temperature could be useful for future applications, such as quantum memories and quantum sensing. © 2023 The Author(s)","EPR; ESR; Microwave cavity QED; Multiple echoes; Quantum memories","","Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute; Technion's Hellen Diller Quantum Center","This research was partially supported by the Technion's Hellen Diller Quantum Center and its Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute .

Benchmark estimations reveal that, while holding everything else constant, each spatial unit is 2.4 p.p. more likely to become a high-risk municipality with additional 10 ​000 cabled houses with NGA networks. In a multinomial discrete choice model setting, the technical novelty of this study lies in providing graphical visualization and economic interpretation of coefficients and average marginal effects as a function of the number of classes used to define the dependent variable, while ensuring the satisfaction of the IIA assumption. The positive and significant coefficients of NGA indicate that additional coverage of NGA networks increases the likelihood of municipalities becoming high-risk for increasing number of spatial units not belonging to the low-risk efficiency frontier. The significant, negative, and decreasing average marginal effects of NGA suggest that the ability to remain a low-risk municipality diminishes with increasing NGA networks coverage as the number of municipalities belonging to the low-risk efficiency frontier decreases. The analysis also confirms that the effect of NGA networks coverage on COVID-19 is statistically significant in the indirect channel. This impact persists due to the mediation of population density, which is directly influenced by NGA networks coverage. All these findings can be explained by the fact that benefits related to productive activities do not outweigh costs associated with leisure time. Hence, this research emphasizes the need for a normative discussion on the intended purpose of digital technologies built on top of NGA networks to ensure a level playing field in the post-pandemic era. © 2023 The Author","COVID-19; Discrete choice analysis; Machine learning; Next generation access; Portugal","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (DSAIPA/CS/0086/2020)","The author appreciates the efforts of all reviewers and Editor-in-Chief, whose suggestions improved the quality of the study.

Here we experimentally demonstrate three types of Chern insulators with synthetic dimensions on a programable 30-qubit-ladder superconducting processor. We directly measure the band structures of the 2D Chern insulator along synthetic dimensions with various configurations of Aubry-André-Harper chains and observe dynamical localisation of edge excitations. With these two signatures of topology, our experiments implement the bulk-edge correspondence in the synthetic 2D Chern insulator. Moreover, we simulate two different bilayer Chern insulators on the ladder-type superconducting processor. With the same and opposite periodically modulated on-site potentials for two coupled chains, we simulate topologically nontrivial edge states with zero Hall conductivity and a Chern insulator with higher Chern numbers, respectively. Our work shows the potential of using superconducting qubits for investigating different intriguing topological phases of quantum matter. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","electrical conductivity; insulation; quantum mechanics; topology; article; conductance; excitation; writing","Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation; Foundational Questions Institute, FQxI, (FQXi-IAF19-06); Asian Office of Aerospace Research and Development, AOARD, (FA2386-20-1-4069); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11904393, 11934018, 12174207, 12274142, 92065114, T2121001); Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (JPMJMS2061); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDB28000000, YJKYYQ20200041); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (Z200009); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFA0304300); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B0303030001)","We thank Hongming Weng for stimulating discussions.

Our proposal depends on collaboration between the generators and discriminator, thus, we call it quantum synergic generative learning. We present numerical evidence that the synergic approach, in some cases, compares favorably to recently proposed quantum generative adversarial learning. In addition to the results obtained with quantum simulators, we also present experimental results obtained with an actual programmable quantum computer. We investigate how a quantum computer implementing generative learning algorithm could learn the concept of a maximally-entangled state. After completing the learning process, the network is able both to recognize and to generate an entangled state. Our approach can be treated as one possible preliminary step to understanding how the concept of quantum entanglement can be learned and demonstrated by a quantum computer. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy, MŠMT; Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR, (19-19002S, CZ.02.1.01); Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (DEC-2019/34/A/ST2/00081); Univerzita Palackého v Olomouci, UP, (DSGC-2021-0026)","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Dawid Maskalaniec and Mateusz Slysz for stimulating discussions and for their contributions to numerical calculations.

According to Poisson statistics, coherent photons are not considered quantum particles due to the bunching phenomenon. Recently, a coherence approach has been applied for quantum correlations such as the Hong–Ou–Mandel (HOM) effect, Franson-type nonlocal correlation, and delayed-choice quantum eraser to understand the mysterious quantum features. In the coherence approach, the quantum correlation has been now understood as a direct result of selective measurements between product bases of phase-coherent photons. Especially in the HOM interpretation, it has been understood that a fixed sum-phase relation between paired photons is the bedrock of quantum entanglement. Here, a coherently excited HOM model is proposed, analyzed, and discussed for the fundamental physics of two-photon correlation using linear optics-based polarization-basis control. For this, polarization-frequency correlation in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer is coherently excited using synchronized acousto-optic modulators, where polarization-basis control is conducted via a selective measurement process of the heterodyne signals. Like quantum operator-based destructive interference in the HOM theory, a perfectly coherent analysis shows the same HOM effects of the paired coherent photons on a beam splitter, whereas individual output intensities are uniform. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation; Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, GIST; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (IITP 2023-2021-0-01810); Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, MSIT; Heeger Center for Advanced Materials, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, HCAM, (GRI-2023)","This research was supported by the MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program (IITP 2023-2021-0-01810) supervised by the IITP (Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation).

Within this paradigm, a quantum algorithm is expressed in terms of a set of quantum gates that are executed on the quantum hardware over time, subject to a number of constraints whose satisfaction must be guaranteed before running the circuit, to allow for feasible execution. The need to guarantee the previous feasibility condition gives rise to the Quantum Circuit Compilation Problem (QCCP). The QCCP has been demonstrated to be NP-Complete, and can be considered as a Planning and Scheduling problem. In this paper, we consider quantum compilation instances deriving from the general Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), applied to the MaxCut problem, devised to be executed on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware architectures. More specifically, in addition to the basic QCCP version, we also tackle other variants of the same problem such as the QCCP-X (QCCP with crosstalk constraints), the QCCP-V (QCCP with variable qubit state initialization), as well as the QCCP-VX that includes both previous variants. All problem variants are solved using genetic algorithms. We perform an experimental study across a conventional set of instances taken from the literature, and show that the proposed genetic algorithm, termed GAVX , outperforms previous approaches in the literature. © 2023, The Author(s).","Genetic algorithm; Makespan; Optimization; Quantum circuit compilation; Scheduling","Approximation algorithms; Logic gates; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; quantum dot; Compilation problems; Computing paradigm; Makespan; Optimisations; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum circuit compilation; Quantum Computing; Quantum gates; Scheduling; Article; computer simulation; controlled study; experimental study; genetic algorithm; process optimization; quantum mechanics; Genetic algorithms","Spanish Government, (PID2019-106263RB-I00); European Space Agency, ESA, (4000112300/14/D/MRP); Cátedra Telefónica, Universidad de Oviedo; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN; Universidad de Oviedo","Open Access funding provided thanks to the CRUE-CSIC agreement with Springer Nature.

Encrypting data using a random phase mask is a simple yet effective way to bolster the data security at the physical layer. Since the interactions of the random phases used for such encryption heavily depend on system properties like data rate, modulation format, distance, degree of phase randomness, laser properties, etc., it is important to determine the optimum operating conditions for different scenarios. In this work, assuming that the transmitter and the receiver have a secret pre-shared key, we present a theoretical study of security in such a system through mutual information analysis. Next, we determine operating conditions which ensure security for 4-PSK, 16-PSK, and 128-QAM formats through numerical simulation. Moreover, we provide an experimental demonstration of the system using 16-QAM modulation. We then use numerical simulation to verify the efficacy of the encryption and study two preventative measures for different modulation formats which will prevent an eavesdropper from obtaining any data. The results demonstrate that the system is secure against a tapping attack if an attacker has no information of the phase modulator and pre-shared key. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; computer simulation; drug efficacy; encryption; security; theoretical study","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Mitacs","We thank Ciena for the use of their WaveLogic modem.

In a quantum network, this protocol can be efficiently implemented using a single copy of a N-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state to distil a secure N-user conference key bit, whereas up to N-1 entanglement pairs are consumed in the traditional pair-wise protocol. We demonstrate the advantage provided by GHZ states in a testbed consisting of a photonic six-user quantum network, where four users can distil either a GHZ state or the required number of Bell pairs for QCKA using network routing techniques. In the asymptotic limit, we report a more than two-fold enhancement of the conference key rate when comparing the two protocols. We extrapolate our data set to show that the resource advantage for the GHZ protocol persists when taking into account finite-key effects. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Network protocols; Network security; Quantum cryptography; Conference key; Conference key agreement; Entangled state; Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state; Key bits; Multiple user; N qubits; Protocol cans; Quantum network; Routing techniques; Quantum entanglement","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/L015110/1, EP/T001011/1); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (ML4Q) EXC 2004/1 -390534769)","This work was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (Grant Nos.

A distinct class of skyrmion hosts are rare earth - transition metal (RE-TM) ferrimagnetic materials. To date, the nature and the control of basic traits of skyrmions in these materials are not fully understood. We show that for an archetypal ferrimagnetic material DyCo3 that exhibits a strong perpendicular anisotropy, the ferrimagnetic skyrmion size can be tuned by an external magnetic field. Moreover, by taking advantage of the high spatial resolution of scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and utilizing a large x-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) contrast that occurs naturally at the RE resonant edges, we resolve the nature of the magnetic domain walls of ferrimagnetic skyrmions. We demonstrate that through this method one can easily discriminate between Bloch and Néel type domain walls for each individual skyrmion. For all isolated ferrimagnetic skyrmions, we observe that the domain walls are of Néel-type. This key information is corroborated with results of micromagnetic simulations and allows us to conclude on the nature of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) which concurs to the stabilisation of skyrmions in this ferrimagnetic system. Establishing that an intrinsic DMI occurs in RE-TM materials will also be beneficial towards a deeper understanding of chiral spin texture control in ferrimagnetic materials. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Dichroism; Dysprosium compounds; Ferrimagnetism; Magnetic domains; Magnetic structure; Rare earths; Textures; Transition metals; Direct observations; Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction; External magnetic field; Ferrimagnetics; Perpendicular anisotropy; Rare earth transition metal; Research interests; Skyrmions; Spin textures; Thin-films; Domain walls","Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie, HZB, (212-10386); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (SPP2137/RA 3570); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (05K19W061)","Funding text 1: We thank the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie for the allocation of synchrotron radiation beamtime (Proposal No. 212-10386).

The complex mechanisms which govern metal-functionalization of polyoxometalates are still poorly understood. Here, we report a coupled set of light-dependent and light-independent reaction equilibria controlling the mono- and di-metal-functionalization of a prototype molecular vanadium oxide cluster. Comprehensive mechanistic analyses show that coordination of a Mg2+ ion to the species {(NMe2H2)2[VV12O32Cl]}3- results in formation of the mono-functionalized {(NMe2H2)[(MgCl)VV12O32Cl]}3- with simultaneous release of a NMe2H2+ placeholder cation. Irradiation of this species with visible light results in one-electron reduction of the vanadate, exchange of the second NMe2H2+ with Mg2+, and formation/crystallization of the di-metal-functionalized [(MgCl)2VIVVV11O32Cl]4-. Mechanistic studies show how stimuli such as light or competing cations affect the coupled equilibria. Transfer of this synthetic concept to other metal cations is also demonstrated, highlighting the versatility of the approach. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","magnesium ion; vanadic acid; vanadium pentoxide; biostimulation; cation; inorganic compound; reduction; salt; Article; binding competition; binding site; complex formation; crystallization; cyclic voltammetry; density functional theory; electron spin resonance; electron transport; electrospray mass spectrometry; irradiation; light; molecular model; nuclear magnetic resonance; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; oxidation reduction potential; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; reaction analysis; room temperature","Gutenberg Research College Mainz; Vienna University; European Research Council, ERC, (101002212); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (389183496, 390874152, 404530119, 510966757); Universität Ulm, UULM","Funding text 1: Financial support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG, project no 390874152 (S.R., C.S.), 389183496 (C.S.), 404530119 (C.S.), 510966757 (D.G.) and the ERC Consolidator Grant “SupraVox”, rant no: 101002212 (C.S.) is gratefully acknowledged.

Herein, based on the compelling identification of the two cleavable surfaces of Co3Sn2S2, we show surface kagome electronic states (SKESs) on a Sn-terminated triangular Co3Sn2S2 surface. Such SKESs are imprinted by vertical p-d electronic hybridization between the surface Sn (subsurface S) atoms and the buried Co kagome-lattice network in the Co3Sn layer under the surface. Owing to the subsequent lateral hybridization of the Sn and S atoms in a corner-sharing manner, the kagome symmetry and topological electronic properties of the Co3Sn layer is proximate to the Sn surface. The SKESs and both hybridizations were verified via qPlus non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) and density functional theory calculations. The construction of SKESs with tunable properties can be achieved by the atomic substitution of surface Sn (subsurface S) with other group III-V elements (Se or Te), which was demonstrated theoretically. This work exhibits the powerful capacity of nc-AFM in characterizing localized topological states and reveals the strategy for synthesis of large-area transition-metal-based kagome-lattice materials using conventional surface deposition techniques. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","cobalt derivative; sulfur derivative; tin derivative; transition element; atomic force microscopy; deposition; hybridization; material layer or surface; quantum mechanics; substitution; sulfur; symmetry; tin; topology; anisotropy; Article; atomic force microscopy; calculation; chemical bond; density functional theory; molecular hybridization; molecular imprinting; potential difference; substitution reaction; surface property; synthesis","Innovation Program of Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0302700); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Basic Energy Sciences, BES, (DE-FG02-99ER45747); McGill University, MGU; Natural Science Foundation of Shenzhen Municipality, (20220810161616001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11974422, 12104313, 61761166009, 61888102); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDB30000000, YSBR-003); Renmin University of China, RUC, (22XNKJ30); Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology, GDSTC, (2021QN02L820); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFA0305800, 2018YFE0202700, 2019YFA0308500, 2022YFA1204100); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","The work is supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61888102 (H.-J.G.), 61761166009 (W.J.), 11974422 (W.J.), and 12104313 (X.K.)), the National Key Research and Development Projects of China (2019YFA0308500 (H.-J.G. and L.H.), 2018YFE0202700 (W.J.), 2022YFA1204100 (H.Y. and H.Chen)and 2018YFA0305800 (L.H., Y.Z., and X.L.)), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB30000000 (W.J., L.H. and H.Chen), YSBR-003 (L.H., H.Chen and X.L.)), and the Innovation Program of Quantum Science and Technology (2021ZD0302700 (H.-J.G., H.Y., L.H and H.Chen)).

But more than qubits, transmons are multilevel nonlinear oscillators that can be used to investigate fundamental physics questions. Here, they are explored as simulators of excited state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs), which are generalizations of quantum phase transitions to excited states. We show that the spectral kissing (coalescence of pairs of energy levels) experimentally observed in the effective Hamiltonian of a driven SNAIL-transmon is an ESQPT precursor. We explore the dynamical consequences of the ESQPT, which include the exponential growth of out-of-time-ordered correlators, followed by periodic revivals, and the slow evolution of the survival probability due to localization. These signatures of ESQPT are within reach for current superconducting circuits platforms and are of interest to experiments with cold atoms and ion traps. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Correlators; Phase transitions; Quantum optics; Qubits; Engineering implementation; Excited-states; Fundamental physics; Generalisation; Multilevels; Non-linear oscillators; Quanta computers; Quantum information processing; Quantum-phase transition; Transmon qubit; Excited states","CEAFMC; MPS Simons Foundation, (678586); Universidad de Huelva High Performance Computer; National Science Foundation, NSF, (2124511, DMR-1936006); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (UNHU-15CE-2848); Secretaría de Estado de Investigacion, Desarrollo e Innovacion, I+D+i, (MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100-011033, PID2019-104002GB-C21); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (UHU-1262561); Consejería de Conocimiento, Investigación y Universidad, Junta de Andalucía","This research was supported by the NSF CCI grant (Award Number 2124511).

However, state-of-the-art continuous-variable quantum teleportation is restricted to moderate fidelities and short-distance configurations. This is due to unavoidable experimental imperfections resulting in thermal decoherence during the teleportation process. Here we present a heralded quantum teleporter able to overcome these limitations through noiseless linear amplification. As a result, we report a high fidelity of 92% for teleporting coherent states using a modest level of quantum entanglement. Our teleporter in principle allows nearly complete removal of loss induced onto the input states being transmitted through imperfect quantum channels. We further demonstrate the purification of a displaced thermal state, impossible via conventional deterministic amplification or teleportation approaches. The combination of high-fidelity coherent state teleportation alongside the purification of thermalized input states permits the transmission of quantum states over significantly long distances. These results are of both practical and fundamental significance; overcoming long-standing hurdles en route to highly-efficient continuous-variable quantum teleportation, while also shining new light on applying teleportation to purify quantum systems from thermal noise. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","communication; detection method; mobile phone; purification; article; drug efficacy; noise","Australian Research Council, ARC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12074233); Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, Australian Research Council, CQC2T, (CE110001027)","The authors acknowledge support from the Australian Research Council (ARC) via the Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology (CE110001027).

However, as these networks grow so does the strong need to reduce complexity and overheads. Polarization-based entanglement distribution networks are a promising approach due to their scalability and no need for trusted nodes. Nevertheless, they are only viable if the birefringence of all-optical distribution fibres in the network is compensated to preserve the polarization-based quantum state. The brute force approach would require a few hundred fibre polarization controllers for even a moderately sized network. Instead, we propose and investigate four different realizations of polarization compensation schemes that can be used in quantum networks. We compare them based on the type of reference signals, complexity, effort, level of disruption to network operations and performance on a four-user quantum network. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Entanglement; Polarization compensation; Quantum bit error rate; Quantum communication; Quantum networks","Bit error rate; Complex networks; Error compensation; Information theory; Polarization; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; All optical; Communications networks; Entanglement; Entanglement distribution; Optical distribution; Polarization compensation; Quantum bit error rate; Quantum network; Quantum state; Unconditional security; Quantum communication","Croatian Ministry of Science and Education; United Kingdom Research and Innovation’s; David O.

The X-ray powder diffraction and IR spectroscopy revealed that the octahedrons with Ni ion in the center remain unchanged regardless of the fluence a sample received. In contrast, proton irradiation greatly influences the hydrogen bonds in the flexible parts in which the 1,3-phenylenediamine is involved. Dc magnetic measurements revealed that several magnetic properties were modified with proton irradiation. The isothermal magnetization measured at T = 2.0 K varied with the proton dose, achieving a 50% increase in magnetization in the highest measured field µ0 H dc = 7 T or a 25% decrease in remanence. The most significant change was observed for the coercive field, which was reduced by 90% compared to the non-irradiated sample. The observed results are accounted for the increased freedom of magnetic moments rotation and the modification of intralayer exchange couplings. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Polish Minister of Education and Science, (DI2017 006047)","We thank O.

Nanoscale imaging of moiré magnets is highly desirable and serves as a prerequisite to investigate a broad range of intriguing physics underlying the interplay between topology, electronic correlations, and unconventional nanomagnetism. Here we report spin defect-based wide-field imaging of magnetic domains and spin fluctuations in twisted double trilayer (tDT) chromium triiodide CrI3. We explicitly show that intrinsic moiré domains of opposite magnetizations appear over arrays of moiré supercells in low-twist-angle tDT CrI3. In contrast, spin fluctuations measured in tDT CrI3 manifest little spatial variations on the same mesoscopic length scale due to the dominant driving force of intralayer exchange interaction. Our results enrich the current understanding of exotic magnetic phases sustained by moiré magnetism and highlight the opportunities provided by quantum spin sensors in probing microscopic spin related phenomena on two-dimensional flatland. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","chromium; magnetic field; physics; quantum mechanics; Article; magnetometry; Moire topography; nanoimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quantum mechanics; quantum optics","National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMR-174774, DMR-2046227, ECCS-2029558); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-21-1-0065, FA9550-21-1-0125, FA9550−20-1-0319); Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-22-1-0056); Alfred P.

The proposed probabilistic energy-based deep learning model trained in a generative manner facilitated by QC yields robust latent representations of molecules, while the proposed data-driven QC-based optimization framework performs guided navigation of the target chemical space by exploiting the structure–property relationships captured by the energy-based model. We demonstrate the viability of the proposed molecular design approach by generating several molecular candidates that satisfy specific property target requirements.

When holes move through an antiferromagnetic spin background, they displace the positions of spins, which induces effective frustration in the magnetic environment. However, a concrete characterization of this effect in a quantum many-body system is still an unsolved problem. Here we present a Hamiltonian reconstruction scheme that allows for a precise quantification of hole-motion-induced frustration. We access non-local correlation functions through projective measurements of the many-body state, from which effective spin-Hamiltonians can be recovered after detaching the magnetic background from dominant charge fluctuations. The scheme is applied to systems of mixed dimensionality, where holes are restricted to move in one dimension, but SU(2) superexchange is two-dimensional. We demonstrate that hole motion drives the spin background into a highly frustrated regime, which can quantitatively be described by an effective J 1–J 2-type spin model. We exemplify the applicability of the reconstruction scheme to ultracold atom experiments by recovering effective spin-Hamiltonians of experimentally obtained 1D Fermi-Hubbard snapshots. Our method can be generalized to fully 2D systems, enabling promising microscopic perspectives on the doped Hubbard model. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Antiferromagnetic materials; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Quantum theory; Spin fluctuations; Antiferromagnetic spins; Antiferromagnets; Displacers; Effective spin Hamiltonian; Magnetic environments; Many body; Nonlocal; Quantum many-body systems; Quantum phase; Unsolved problems; Hamiltonians","Optical Physics at Harvard University; National Science Foundation, NSF; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (948141); European Research Council, ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (EXC-2111—390814868)","We are thankful for valuable discussions with F.

An adequate explanation for the color requires a theoretical approach able to compute subgap excitons in periodic crystals, reliably and without free parameters—a formidable challenge. The literature often fails to disentangle two important factors: what makes excitons form and what makes them optically bright. We pick two archetypal cases as examples: NiO with green color and MnF2 with pink color, and employ two kinds of ab initio many body Green’s function theories; the first, a perturbative theory based on low-order extensions of the G W approximation, is able to explain the color in NiO, while the same theory is unable to explain why MnF2 is pink. We show its color originates from higher order spin-flip transitions that modify the optical response, which is contained in dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). We show that symmetry lowering mechanisms may determine how ‘bright’ these excitons are, but they are not fundamental to their existence. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","crystal structure; insulation; optical property; transition element; wavelength; ab initio calculation; article; theoretical study","SURF Cooperative; TGCC; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC36-08GO28308); Office of Science, SC, (BES-ERCAP0021783, DE-AC02-05CH11231); Basic Energy Sciences, BES","Funding text 1: M.I.K., A.I.L., and S.A. are supported by the ERC Synergy Grant, project 854843 FASTCORR (Ultrafast dynamics of correlated electrons in solids).

Quantum algorithms have shown promise in solving optimization problems, yet none of the current algorithms can effectively handle arbitrary constraints. We introduce a technique that uses quantum Zeno dynamics to solve optimization problems with multiple arbitrary constraints, including inequalities. We show that the dynamics of quantum optimization can be efficiently restricted to the in-constraint subspace on a fault-tolerant quantum computer via repeated projective measurements, requiring only a small number of auxiliary qubits and no post-selection. Our technique has broad applicability, which we demonstrate by incorporating it into the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and variational quantum circuits for optimization. We evaluate our method numerically on portfolio optimization problems with multiple realistic constraints and observe better solution quality and higher in-constraint probability than state-of-the-art techniques. We implement a proof-of-concept demonstration of our method on the Quantinuum H1-2 quantum processor. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Dynamics; Financial data processing; Global optimization; Quantum computers; Variational techniques; 'current; Arbitrary constraints; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Fault-tolerant; Optimization problems; Projective measurement; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum optimization; Quantum Zeno dynamics; Constrained optimization","Global Technology Applied Research center of JPMorgan; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM","The authors wish to thank Antonio Mezzacapo from IBM for his invaluable contributions to this project.

Although phononic and electronic transport underpin the physical origin of thermoelectrics, vacancy has only played a stereotyped role as a scattering center. Here we reveal the multifunctionality of vacancy in tailoring the transport properties of an emerging thermoelectric material, defective n-type ZrNiBi. The phonon kinetic process is mediated in both propagating velocity and relaxation time: vacancy-induced local soft bonds lower the phonon velocity while acoustic-optical phonon coupling, anisotropic vibrations, and point-defect scattering induced by vacancy shorten the relaxation time. Consequently, defective ZrNiBi exhibits the lowest lattice thermal conductivity among the half-Heusler family. In addition, a vacancy-induced flat band features prominently in its electronic band structure, which is not only desirable for electron-sufficient thermoelectric materials but also interesting for driving other novel physical phenomena. Finally, better thermoelectric performance is established in a ZrNiBi-based compound. Our findings not only demonstrate a promising thermoelectric material but also promote the fascinating vacancy-mediated anomalous transport properties for multidisciplinary explorations. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","reaction kinetics; scattering; thermal conductivity; transport process; velocity; article; cross coupling reaction; phonon; relaxation time; thermal conductivity; velocity; vibration","Innovation Group Project of Sichuan Province, (20CXTD0090); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-15-1-0236, FA9550-20-1-0068); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program, (2023NSFSC0970); T.L.L Temple Foundation, TLLTF; John J. and Rebecca Moores Endowment; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (247310070, 39085490, 453261231, EXC 2147, SFB 1143); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFB2203400); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project, (B20030)","Z.M.W. acknowledges financial support from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2019YFB2203400) and the “111 Project” (B20030).

We develop an entanglement mechanism between continuous variable (CV) states of definite parity and delocalized photon (discrete variable (DV) state) leading to deterministic generation of the hybrid entangled states. The mechanism is realized by means of mixing of the input states on beam splitter (BS) with arbitrary transmission and reflection coefficients followed by measurement of the number of photons in the measurement mode by photon number resolving (PNR) detector. The scheme under study allows for one to partially control hybrid entanglement by change of the transmission/reflection coefficients of the BS. There are wide domains of values which guarantee the generation of maximum hybrid entanglement.

The temporal wave vector of the system is obtained for the initial maximally entangled two-qubit state and initial vacuum state of the magnon and cavity modes. Additionally, the mathematical inequalities for obtaining the cavity–magnon steering and qubit–qubit steering are introduced. The findings reveal that steering between the magnon and cavity is asymmetric, while steering between the two qubits is symmetric in our system. Increasing the atom–field coupling improves steering from magnon to field, while reducing steering between the two qubits. Moreover, increasing magnon–field coupling enhances and elevates the lower bounds of qubit–qubit steering. Further, adding the damping rates causes deterioration of the cavity–magnon steering and qubit–qubit steering. However, the steering persistence is slightly greater when damping originates from the cavity field rather than the magnon modes based on the coupling parameters. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Al-Azhar University","","M.Y.

Here, we explore such connection by investigating hybrid cavity systems that incorporate both a ferromagnet and a topological insulator. We find that electrons in the topological surface state efficiently mediate the effective electric dipole coupling between the spin of the ferromagnet and the electric field of the cavity, in contrast with the conventional cavity magnonics theory based on magnetic dipole coupling. We refer to this coupling as topological magnon-photon interaction, estimating it one order of magnitude stronger than the conventional magnon-photon coupling, and showing that its sign can be manipulated. We discuss the potential of our proposed device to allow for scaling down and controlling the cavity system using electronics.

When the photon energy is smaller than the bandgap energy (1.46 eV) of a 20 nm Ge QD (for instance, λ = 1310 nm and 1550 nm illuminations), there is no change in the peak voltages of tunneling current spectroscopy even when the irradiation power density reaches as high as 10 µW/µm2. In contrast, a considerable shift in the first hole-tunneling current peak towards positive VG is induced (ΔVG ≈ 0.08 V at 0.33 nW/µm2 and 0.15 V at 1.4 nW/µm2) and even additional photocurrent peaks are created at higher positive VG values (ΔVG ≈ 0.2 V at 10 nW/µm2 irradiation) by illumination at λ = 850 nm (where the photon energy matches the bandgap energy of the 20 nm Ge QD). These experimental observations were further strengthened when Ge-QD SHTs were illuminated by λ = 405 nm lasers at much lower optical-power conditions. The newly-photogenerated current peaks are attributed to the contribution of exciton, biexciton, and positive trion complexes. Furthermore, the exciton binding energy can be determined by analyzing the tunneling current spectra. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","National Science and Technology Council, NSTC; National Science Council, NSC, (109-2221-E-009-022-MY3, 111-2119-M-A49-003, 112-2119-M-A49-006)","This work was supported by National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan (NSC 112-2119-M-A49-006, 111-2119-M-A49-003, and 109-2221-E-009-022-MY3).

In this scenario, we introduce constants, which we relate to the Grothendieck constant of order 3. We associate them with the white noise resistance of the prepared qubits and to the critical detection efficiency of the measurements performed. Large-scale numerical tools are used to bound the constants. This allows us to obtain new bounds on the minimum detection efficiency that a setup with 70 preparations and 70 measurement settings can tolerate. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; certification; outcome assessment; white noise","European Commission, EC; National Research, Development and Innovation Office, (2019-2.1.7-ERA-NET-2020-00003)","We thank Mátyás Barczy, Emmanuel Zambrini Cruzeiro and Armin Tavakoli for valuable discussions.

Here we demonstrate absorptive-type coherent memory based on long-lived mechanical excitations. The itinerant coherent microwave field is captured, stored, and retrieved from a mechanical memory oscillator which is pre-cooled to the ground state. The phase space distribution allows us to distinguish between coherent and thermal components and study their evolution as a function of storage time. Our device exhibits attractive functions with an energy decay time of T 1 = 15.9 s, a thermal decoherence rate of Γth = 2.85 Hz, and acquires less than one quantum noise during the τ coh = 55.7 ms storage period. We demonstrate that both the amplitude and phase information of microwave coherent states can be recovered, indicating the coherence of our memory device.

However, they face the key challenge of controlling interactions between the defect spins, since they are spatially fixed inside the host lattice. In this work, we present a dressed state approach to control the effective dipolar coupling between solid-state spins and demonstrate this scheme experimentally using two strongly-coupled nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Through Ramsey spectroscopy on the sensor spin, we detect the change of the effective dipolar field generated by the control spin prepared in different dressed states. To observe the change of interaction dynamics, we deploy spin-lock-based polarization transfer measurements between the two NV spins in different dressed states. This scheme allows us to control the distribution of interaction strengths in strongly interacting spin systems, which can be a valuable tool for generating multi-spin correlated states for quantum-enhanced sensing. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Quantum optics; Spin dynamics; Dipolar couplings; Dipolar interaction; Dressed state; Host lattice; Many body; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Quantum system; Ramsey spectroscopy; State-control; Strong interaction; Defects","Center for Nanoscale Systems, (1541959); ILJU; Integrated NSF, (EAR1647504); KIST open research program, (2E32241); University of Maryland Quantum Technology Center; National Science Foundation, NSF, (ECCS-1408075, PHY-1504610); Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF1110400, W911NF1510548); Army Research Laboratory, ARL, (W911NF-19–2–0181); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (20J01757)","The authors would like to thank Keigo Arai, Huiliang Zhang, and Hosung Seo for helpful discussions.

The photons undergo the magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering, which is a well-established tool for the cavity-assisted manipulations of magnons as well as magnon spintronics. At first, we derive the desired interaction Hamiltonian under the influence of the anti-Stokes scattering process and then proceed to analyze the dynamical evolution of quantum statistics of photons and magnons as well as their intermodal entanglement. The results show that both photons and magnons generally acquire some nonclassical features, e.g., the strong antibunching and anti-correlation. Interestingly, the system may experience the perfect photon and magnon blockade phenomena, simultaneously. Besides, the nonclassical features may be protected against the unwanted environmental effects for a relatively long time, especially, in the weak driving field regime and when the system is initiated with a small number of particles. However, it should be noted that some fast quantum-classical transitions may occur in-between. Although the unwanted dissipative effects plague the nonclassical features, we show that this system can be adopted to prepare optomagnonic entangled states. The generation of entangled states depends on the initial state of the system and the interaction regime. The intermodal photon-magnon entanglement may be generated and pronounced, especially, if the system is initialized with low intensity even Schrödinger cat state in the strong coupling regime. The cavity-assisted manipulation of magnons is a unique and flexible mechanism that allows an interesting test bed for investigating the interdisciplinary contexts involving quantum optics and spintronics. Moreover, such a hybrid optomagnonic system may be used to design both on-demand single-photon and single-magnon sources and may find potential applications in quantum information processing. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","","","E.

Firstly, we employ the block permutation encryption and diffusion confusion encryption module, which is based on dynamic multiplexing chaotic sequences, to encrypt the plaintext and obtain the ciphertext. Subsequently, the hash value of this round’s ciphertext is utilized to generate the chaotic key, produced by the multiplexing sequence of this round after mathematical processing. Then, the key is used to generate the chaotic sequence to confuse the N-th of the multiplexed sequence, and the next round of multiplexed sequence is obtained. If the current round of chaotic sequence has been completely confused, the chaotic sequence is re-generated to generate a new multiplex sequence by using the key generated by the current round key and the initial key. Finally, the above steps are repeated for the encryption of each frame of the video. Compared with the traditional permutation coding algorithm, it increases the difficulty of estimation or recognition while ensuring efficiency, and effectively improves the avalanche effect of the algorithm. Through frame by frame ciphertext closed-loop feedback, it has the ability to resist known plaintext attack and selected plaintext attack. The results show that the scheme has high security and significant diffusion characteristics, and can effectively resist various common cryptographic attacks. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; coding algorithm; diffusion; encryption; security; videorecording","Project for Zhongshan Science and Technology, (2021B2062); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2023A1515011717)","This work was supported in part by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation under Grant 2023A1515011717, and in part by Project for Zhongshan Science and Technology under Grant 2021B2062.

However, higher dimensional quantum systems constitute a promising alternative and are increasingly explored in theory and practice. Here, we explore the capabilities of multi-level quantum systems, so-called qudits, for their use in a quantum machine learning context. We formulate classification and regression problems with the data re-uploading approach and demonstrate that a quantum circuit operating on a single qudit is able to successfully learn highly non-linear decision boundaries of classification problems such as the MNIST digit recognition problem. We demonstrate that the performance strongly depends on the relation between the qudit states representing the labels and the structure of labels in the training data set. Such a bias can lead to substantial performance improvement over qubit-based circuits in cases where the labels, the qudit states, and the operators employed to encode the data are well-aligned. Furthermore, we elucidate the influence of the choice of the elementary operators and show that a squeezing operator is necessary to achieve good performances. We also show that there exists a trade-off for qudit systems between the number of circuit-generating operators in each processing layer and the total number of layers needed to achieve a given accuracy. Finally, we compare classification results from numerically exact simulations and their equivalent implementation on actual IBM quantum hardware. The findings of our work support the notion that qudit-based algorithms exhibit attractive traits and constitute a promising route to increasing the computational capabilities of quantum machine learning approaches. © 2023, The Author(s).","Data re-uploading; Parameterized quantum circuits; Quantum machine learning; Qudits","Classification (of information); Computation theory; Economic and social effects; Quantum optics; Qubits; Timing circuits; Data re-uploading; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Parameterized; Parameterized quantum circuit; Performance; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Qudit; Machine learning","Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH; Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency; HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme, (101080086—NeQST); European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency, CINEA; European Commission, EC","Funding text 1: NLW acknowledges funding from the Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH for attending the conference on Quantum Techniques in Machine Learning (QTML) 2022.

Here, we identify a topological soliton molecule formed spatially in an electronic system, a quasi 1D charge density wave of indium atomic wires. This system is composed of two coupled Peierls chains, which are endowed with a Z4 topology and three distinct, right-chiral, left-chiral, and non-chiral, solitons. Our scanning tunneling microscopy measurements identify a bound state of right- and left-chiral solitons with distinct in-gap states and net zero phase shift. Our density functional theory calculations reveal the attractive interaction of these solitons and the hybridization of their electronic states. This result initiates the study of the interaction between solitons in electronic systems, which can provide novel manybody electronic states and extra data-handling capacity beyond the given soliton topology. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","indium; hybridization; indium; scanning tunnelling microscopy; topology; ab initio calculation; Article; chirality; density functional theory; energy consumption; membrane structure; molecular hybridization; scanning tunneling microscopy; transition temperature; visual system","Institute for Basic Science, IBS, (IBS-R014-D1)","This work was supported by the Institute for Basic Science (Grant No. IBS-R014-D1).

An archetypical example is polariton, a half-light-half-matter quasi particle inheriting simultaneously the robust coherence of light and the strong interaction of matter, which plays an important role in many exotic phenomena. Here, we open up a new kind of cooperative coupling between plasmon and different excitonic complexes in WS2-silver nanocavities, namely plasmon-exciton-trion-charged biexciton four coupling states. Thanks to the large Bohr radius of up to 5 nm, the charged biexciton polariton exhibits strong saturation nonlinearity, ~30 times higher than the neutral exciton polariton. Transient absorption dynamics further reveal the ultrafast many-body interaction nature, with a timescale of <100 fs. The demonstration of biexciton polariton here combines high nonlinearity, simple processing and strong scalability, permitting access for future energy-efficient optical switching and information processing. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","absorption; energy efficiency; nonlinearity; saturation; silver; three-dimensional modeling; Article; chemical vapor deposition; controlled study; data availability; dissociation; excitation; information processing; light absorption; molecular interaction; nonlinear system; room temperature","Postgraduate Scientific Research Innovation Project of Hunan Province, (CX20220001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62075240, 62105364); National University of Defense Technology, NUDT, (ZK22-16); Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province, (2021RC2068)","The authors are grateful for financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62105364, 62075240); The Science and Technology Innovation Program of Hunan Province (2021RC2068); The Scientific Researches Foundation of the National University of Defense Technology (ZK22-16); and Postgraduate Scientific Research Innovation Project of Hunan Province (CX20220001).

Yet, there is no universal method that would simultaneously accurately account for strong electron-phonon interactions and electronic correlations. By combining methods of the variational quantum eigensolver and the variational non-Gaussian solver, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm suitable for this type of correlated systems. This hybrid method tackles systems with arbitrarily strong electron-phonon coupling without increasing the number of required qubits and quantum gates, as compared to purely electronic models. We benchmark our method by applying it to the paradigmatic Hubbard-Holstein model at half filling, and show that it correctly captures the competition between charge density wave and antiferromagnetic phases, quantitatively consistent with exact diagonalization. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Charge density; Charge density waves; Electrons; Quantum theory; Combining method; Eigensolvers; Electron phonon; Electronic correlation; Electrons and phonons; Non-Gaussian; Phonon system; Quantum-classical; Quantum-classical methods; Universal method; Electron-phonon interactions","Kenny Choo and Tao Shi; Texas Advanced Computing Center; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMR-2038011, DMR-2337930); Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-20-1-0163); International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; European Research Council, ERC; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; Universität Zürich, UZH, (FK-22-085); Horizon 2020, (ERC-StG-Neupert-757867-PARATOP)","Funding text 1: We acknowledge technical help from Vivek Dixit and Jiarui Liu and insightful discussions from Kenny Choo and Tao Shi.

Leveraging the unique properties of multiple quantum degrees of freedom, this protocol expands the channel capacity and enhances transmission efficiency. Compared to previous measurement-device-independent quantum dialogue (MDI-QD) protocols, this protocol not only further improves transmission efficiency but also enables mutual authentication between correspondents, effectively defending against the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. The utilization of a cross-Kerr medium for Bell measurements offers a 50% increase in efficiency compared to linear optical equipment.

As diamond is one of the promising materials for solid state quantum devices fabricated by ion implantation, we developed a single board diamond detector/preamplifier implantation system to serve as a testbed for implantation sites of different areas and geometry. We determined that for simple circular openings in a detector electrode, the uniformity of detection of the impinging ions increases as the area of the sites decreases. By altering the implantation site design and introducing lateral electric field, we were able to increase the area of the implantation site by an order of magnitude, without decreasing the detection uniformity. Successful detection of 140 keV copper ions that penetrate on average under 100 nm was demonstrated, over the 800 µm2 area implantation site (large enough to accommodate over 2 × 105 possible qubits), with 100% detection efficiency. The readout electronics of the implantation system were calibrated by a referent 241Am gamma source, achieving an equivalent noise charge value of 48 electrons, at room temperature, less than 1% of the energy of impinging ions. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","European Commission, EC, (101052200—EUROfusion, 824096)","The authors would like to thank Michal Pomorski for fabrication of electrodes.

While several demonstrations of such ground-state cooled systems have been achieved, in particular in sideband-resolved cavity optomechanics, for many systems overcoming the heating from the thermal bath remains a major challenge. In contrast, optomechanical systems in the sideband-unresolved limit are much easier to realize due to the relaxed requirements on their optical properties, and the possibility to use a feedback control schemes to reduce the motional energy. The achievable thermal occupation is ultimately limited by the correlation between the measurement precision and the back-action from the measurement. Here, we demonstrate measurement-based feedback cooling on a fully integrated optomechanical device fabricated using a pick-and-place method, operating in the deep sideband-unresolved limit. With the large optomechanical interaction and a low thermal decoherence rate, we achieve a minimal average phonon occupation of 0.76 when pre-cooled with liquid helium and 3.5 with liquid nitrogen. Significant sideband asymmetry for both bath temperatures verifies the quantum character of the mechanical motion. Our method and device are ideally suited for sensing applications directly operating at the quantum limit, greatly simplifying the operation of an optomechanical system in this regime. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","helium; liquid nitrogen; asymmetry; cooling; heating; helium; precision; quantum mechanics; Article; feedback system; light absorption; light intensity; low temperature; measurement precision; noise measurement; optomechanics; room temperature; spa treatment; spectroscopy","Kavli Nanolab Delft; European Research Council, ERC, (101001005); Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschap, OCW, (680-92-18-04); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Ralf Riedinger and Sungkun Hong for their valuable discussions.

However, the flexibility in design of these systems is often restricted by the properties of the integration material platforms. Here, we overcome this choice by using hybrid integration of ultra-low-loss silicon nitride waveguides with indium phosphide electro-optic modulators to produce high-performance quantum key distribution transceiver chips. Access to the best properties of both materials allows us to achieve active encoding and decoding of photonic qubits on-chip at GHz speeds and with sub-1% quantum bit error rates over long fibre distances. We demonstrate bidirectional secure bit rates of 1.82 Mbps over 10 dB channel attenuation and positive secure key rates out to 250 km of fibre.

Here we provide a rigorous derivation of decoherence within a full-fledged model of quantum spacetime, encoded by noncommutativity at the Planck scale. Specifically, we obtain a generalized time evolution of quantum systems in which pure states can evolve into mixed states. This takes the form of a Lindblad-like time evolution for the density operator when the action of time translations generator is deformed by the effects of spacetime noncommutativity. The decoherence time for the evolution of a free particle is used to show that the Planck mass is the maximum allowed mass for elementary quantum systems. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Decoherence; Density operators; Lindblad; Mixed state; Noncommutativity; Planck scale; Pure state; Quantum spacetime; Quantum system; Time evolutions","Compagnia di San Paolo, CSP; Foundational Questions Institute, FQxI, (2018-190483); Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (20179ZF5KS); Instituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, INFN","We acknowledge support from the INFN Iniziativa Specifica QUAGRAP.

Exciting recent examples are the higher-order topological phases, manifesting via localized lower-dimensional boundary states. Moreover, flat electronic bands with a non-trivial topology arise in various lattices and can hold a finite superfluid density, bounded by the Chern number C. Here we consider attractive interaction in the dice lattice that hosts flat bands with C = ± 2 and show that the induced superconducting state exhibits a second-order topological phase with mixed singlet-triplet pairing. The second-order nature of the topological superconducting phase is revealed by the zero-energy Majorana bound states at the lattice corners. Hence, the topology of the normal state dictates the nature of the Majorana localization. These findings suggest that flat bands with a higher Chern number provide feasible platforms for inducing higher-order topological superconductivity. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Chern numbers; Condensed-matter physics; Flat band; High-order; Higher-order; Lattice geometry; Localised; Majorana; Second orders; Topological phase; Topology","National Supercomputing Mission; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Basic Energy Sciences, BES; Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering, DMSE; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST; Ministry of Electronics and Information technology, Meity","This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division.

The algorithm allows to classify data into many clusters, and can easily be implemented in few-qubit Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices. The idea of the algorithm relies on reducing the clustering problem to an optimization, and then solving it via a Variational Quantum Eigensolver combined with non-orthogonal qubit states. In practice, the method uses maximally-orthogonal states of the target Hilbert space instead of the usual computational basis, allowing for a large number of clusters to be considered even with few qubits. We benchmark the algorithm with numerical simulations using real datasets, showing excellent performance even with one single qubit. Moreover, a tensor network simulation of the algorithm implements, by construction, a quantum-inspired clustering algorithm that can run on current classical hardware. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","","","R.

To meet the requirements for integrating superconducting quantum circuits, the ideal method is to grow α-Ta film on a silicon substrate compatible with industrial manufacturing. Here we report the α-Ta film sputter-grown on Si (100) with a low-loss superconducting TiNx buffer layer. The α-Ta film with a large growth temperature window has a good crystalline character. The superconducting critical transition temperature (Tc) and residual resistivity ratio (RRR) in the α-Ta film grown at 500 °C are higher than that in the α-Ta film grown at room temperature (RT).

Quantum secret sharing schemes can be developed by utilizing different features of quantum mechanics, and quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is an effective way to achieve secret sharing using single qubits. The utilization of QSDC offers certain benefits, such as low cost, high security, and great potential for implementation with current technologies. However, the purpose of QSDC is different from that of QSS, which causes some vulnerabilities, such as dishonest participant attacks. We discover two critical factors that affect the security of traditional protocols. Firstly, they skip a few steps from the QSDC protocol to the QSS protocol. Secondly, the participants have different privileges. This can lead to participants with more privileges engaging in potential attack behavior. In light of these issues, this study proposes a new multiparty QSS scheme to address these vulnerabilities.

The entangled states time evolution was studied in the presence of both classical and quantum noise. It was demonstrated that one pair of Bell's states is robust to the Gaussian fluctuations, while the another one decays. The decay law of unstable entangled states is determined by the noise correlation function. The developed general formalism was applied for analysis the dynamics of entangled states in the presence of fluctuations produced by the electron–phonon interaction. It was revealed that unstable entangled states interacting with phonon bath can demonstrate the crossover between short time exponential decay law and long time power law decay. Obtained results can be effectively exploited for quantum computation, in which it is essential to be able to retrieve information about the initial quantum state even in the presence of interaction with the environment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Entanglement; Fluctuations; Quantum computation; Quantum dots","Gaussian noise (electronic); Phonons; Quantum noise; Qubits; Semiconductor quantum dots; Bell state; Decay law; Direct calculation; Entanglement; Fluctuation; Quantum dot; Qubit entangled state; Time dependent; Two-qubit; Quantum entanglement","MSU Program of Development, (23A-SCH06-03); Foundation for the Advancement of Theoretical Physics and Mathematics","We acknowledge the support from the MSU Program of Development, Project No 23A-SCH06-03 .

In order to study the spin and entanglement properties of these electrons, one must separate them spatially via a process known as Cooper pair splitting (CPS). Here we provide the first demonstration of CPS in a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). By coupling two quantum dots to a superconductor-semiconductor hybrid region we achieve efficient Cooper pair splitting, and clearly distinguish it from other local and non-local processes. When the spin degeneracy of the dots is lifted, they can be operated as spin-filters to obtain information about the spin of the electrons forming the Cooper pair. Not only do we observe a near perfect splitting of Cooper pairs into opposite-spin electrons (i.e. conventional singlet pairing), but also into equal-spin electrons, thus achieving triplet correlations between the quantum dots. Importantly, the exceptionally large spin-orbit interaction in our 2DEGs results in a strong triplet component, comparable in amplitude to the singlet pairing. The demonstration of CPS in a scalable and flexible platform provides a credible route to study on-chip entanglement and topological superconductivity in the form of artificial Kitaev chains. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","quantum dot; copper; correlation; electron; superconductivity; two-dimensional modeling; Article; atomic layer deposition; conductance; cooper pair splitting; data extraction; electric potential; electron; gas; molecular beam epitaxy","Microsoft Quantum; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","We thank T.

Notably, however, isotopes in natural materials are homogenously distributed in space. Here, we propose a method to configure material properties by repositioning isotopes in engineered van der Waals (vdW) isotopic heterostructures. We showcase the properties of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) isotopic heterostructures in engineering confined photon-lattice waves—hyperbolic phonon polaritons. By varying the composition, stacking order, and thicknesses of h10BN and h11BN building blocks, hyperbolic phonon polaritons can be engineered into a variety of energy-momentum dispersions. These confined and tailored polaritons are promising for various nanophotonic and thermal functionalities. Due to the universality and importance of isotopes, our vdW isotope heterostructuring method can be applied to engineer the properties of a broad range of materials. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","dimeticone; isotope; boron isotope; construction material; dispersion; geotechnical property; momentum; stable isotope; Article; biomedical engineering; crystal structure; dispersion; hexagonal crystal; phonon","National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMR-2005194, DMR-2238691); Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-20-1-2474); American Cancer Society, ACS, (66229-DNI6); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-21-1-0319); Auburn University, AU","Work at Auburn University was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DMR-2238691, DMR-2005194, and ACS PRF fund 66229-DNI6.

The versatility of the metallocenes stems from their ability to stabilize a wide range of formal electron counts. To date, d-block metallocenes with an electron count of up to 20 have been synthesized and utilized in catalysis, sensing, and other fields. However, d-block metallocenes with more than formal 20-electron counts have remained elusive. The synthesis and isolation of such complexes are challenging because the metal–carbon bonds in d-block metallocenes become weaker with increasing deviation from the stable 18-electron configuration. Here, we report the synthesis, isolation, and characterization of a 21-electron cobaltocene derivative. This discovery is based on the ligand design that allows the coordination of an electron pair donor to a 19-electron cobaltocene derivative while maintaining the cobalt–carbon bonds, a previously unexplored synthetic approach. Furthermore, we elucidate the origin of the stability, redox chemistry, and spin state of the 21-electron complex. This study reveals a synthetic method, structure, chemical bonding, and properties of the 21-electron metallocene derivative that expands our conceptual understanding of d-block metallocene chemistry. We expect that this report will open up previously unexplored synthetic possibilities in d-block transition metal chemistry, including the fields of catalysis and materials chemistry. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","carbon; metallocene; transition element; catalysis; chemical bonding; ligand; organic compound; Article; catalysis; chemical binding; chemical bond; comparative study; controlled study; cyclic voltammetry; electron; electron spin resonance; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; isolation; nuclear magnetic resonance; oxidation reduction reaction; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; room temperature; synthesis; vibrating sample magnetometry; X ray diffraction","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (GE_3117-1-1); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (19H05621, 22K05134); Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, OIST; Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (21-73-10191)","Funding for this work was provided by the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (22K05134 (S.T.), 19H05621 (K.Sa.)), the German Research Foundation (DFG, GE_3117-1-1 (U.G.)), and the Russian Science Foundation (grant No. 21-73-10191 in part of the quantum topological study (S.V.K. and R.R.F.)).

So far, two independent classes of wave states in the Rabi oscillations have been revealed as spin waves and orbital waves, while a Rabi wave state simultaneously merging the spin and orbital angular momentum has remained elusive. Here we report on the experimental and theoretical observation and control of spin–orbit-coupled Rabi oscillations in the higher-order regime of light. We constitute a pseudo spin-1/2 formalism and optically synthesize a magnetization vector through light-crystal interaction. We observe simultaneous oscillations of these ingredients in weak and strong coupling regimes, which are effectively controlled by a beam-dependent synthetic magnetic field. We introduce an electrically tunable platform, allowing fine control of transition between different oscillatory modes, resulting in an emission of orbital-angular-momentum beams with tunable topological structures. Our results constitute a general framework to explore spin–orbit couplings in the higher-order regime, offering routes to manipulating the spin and orbital angular momentum in three and four dimensions. The close analogy with the Pauli equation in quantum mechanics, nonlinear optics, etc., implies that the demonstrated concept can be readily generalized to different disciplines. © 2023, Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics (CIOMP), CAS.","","Angular momentum; Magnetic fields; Nonlinear equations; Nonlinear optics; High-order; Higher-order; Magnetic-field; Orbital angular momentum; Rabi oscillations; Spin angular momentum; Spin orbits; Substantial investigations; Synthesised; Wave state; Quantum theory","Outstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation Funded Programs for Doctoral Students of Jinan University, (2021CXB005); Pearl River talent project, (2017GC010280); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11974146, 62175091); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M701436); Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project, (202201020061); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B090922006)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62175091, 11974146), the Pearl River talent project (2017GC010280), the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (2020B090922006), the Guangzhou Science and technology project (202201020061), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2021M701436), and the Outstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation Funded Programs for Doctoral Students of Jinan University (2021CXB005).

However, current quantum devices are only capable of short unstructured gate sequences followed by native measurements. We accept this limitation and turn it into a new paradigm for characterizing quantum gate-sets. A single experiment—random sequence estimation—solves a wealth of estimation problems, with all complexity moved to classical post-processing. We derive robust channel variants of shadow estimation with close-to-optimal performance guarantees and use these as a primitive for partial, compressive and full process tomography as well as the learning of Pauli noise.

Here, we apply first-principles calculations to determine the coupling of the VB− electronic spin to strain and electric fields. Our work unravels the interplay between local piezoelectric and elastic effects contributing to the final response to the electric fields. The theoretical predictions are then used to analyse optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra recorded on hBN crystals containing different densities of VB− centres. We prove that the orthorhombic zero-field splitting parameter results from local electric fields produced by surrounding charge defects. This work paves the way towards applications of VB− centres for quantitative electric field imaging and quantum sensing under pressure. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Defects; III-V semiconductors; Magnetic resonance; Atomic scale; Electronic spins; External perturbations; First principle calculations; Piezoelectric; Planar defect; Quantum sensors; Sensing layers; Spin sensors; Two-dimensional materials; Electric fields","Governmental Agency; Institute for Quantum Technologies in Occitanie; KIFÜ; Kevin Herminghuysen; Ministry of Culture and Innovation; Ohio State University Nuclear Reactor Laboratory; Quantum Information National Laboratory of Hungary, (2022-2.1.1-NL-2022-00004); Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-20-1-2474, N00014-22-1-2582); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC07-051D14517); Office of Nuclear Energy, NE; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR-21-ESRE-0025); Nemzeti Kutatási Fejlesztési és Innovációs Hivatal, NKFIH, (KKP129866)","This work was supported by the National Excellence Programme for the project of Quantum-coherent materials (NKFIH Grant no.

In this study, we used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh, with particular emphasis on identifying dominant variants and associated mutations. We used high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) to obtain DNA sequences from COVID-19 patient samples and compared these sequences to the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 reference genome using the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Our phylogenetic and mutational analyzes revealed that the majority (88%) of the samples belonged to the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25, whereas the remaining 11% were assigned to the parental lineage B.1.1. Two main mutations, D614G and P681R, were identified in the spike protein sequences of the samples. The D614G mutation, which is the most common, decreases S1 domain flexibility, whereas the P681R mutation may increase the severity of viral infections by increasing the binding affinity between the spike protein and the ACE2 receptor. We employed molecular modeling techniques, including protein modeling, molecular docking, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) geometry optimization, to build and validate three-dimensional models of the S_D614G-ACE2 and S_P681R-ACE2 complexes from the predominant strains. The description of the binding mode and intermolecular contacts of the referenced systems suggests that the P681R mutation may be associated with increased viral pathogenicity in Bangladeshi patients due to enhanced electrostatic interactions between the mutant spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor, underscoring the importance of continuous genomic surveillance in the fight against COVID -19. Finally, the binding profile of the S_D614G-ACE2 and S_P681R-ACE2 complexes offer valuable insights to deeply understand the binding site characteristics that could help to develop antiviral therapeutics that inhibit protein–protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2 receptor. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","National Institute of Laboratory Medicine and Referral Centre; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, MOST","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the encouragement and support extended by the project, which is financed by the government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.

In the case of the energy constraint, we find that under the coarsening measurement in reference and final resolution, the quantum violation of the LGI for the pure qubit is the most robust; on the other hand, the quantum violation of the LGI for the dephasing qubit is the most vulnerable, and the quantum violation of the LGI for driven qubit lies between that of pure qubit and dissipation qubit. Under the coarsening of measurement temporal reference, the quantum violation of the LGI for the pure qubit is more robust than that of the qubit with driven. Moreover, in the case of a qubit that is subjected to driving and is in the presence of dissipation and dephasing, the robustness of quantum violations of the LGI for these scenario systems will become vulnerable, with the driven intensity and the rate of spontaneous emission increasing, respectively, for coarsening measurement both in reference and in final resolution. In addition, in the energy constraint and the projective measurement, the LGI can attain its maximum violation value, 1.5, for the coherent dynamics; while for drive, dissipative and dephasing qubits, the LGI cannot attain the value of 1.5. For systems in the presence of dissipation and dephasing, we find that in the energy constraint, the robustness of the coarsening measurement in final resolution exhibits more vulnerable than that of the coarsening measurement in reference. And for systems with drive and without drive, the robustness of the coarsening measurement in temporal reference is the most robust, and the robustness of the coarsening of measurement final measurement resolution is the most vulnerable. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62201324); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2021LLZ001, ZR2022QA101, ZR2022QF065)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 62201324), and Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2022QA101, ZR2022QF065 and and ZR2021LLZ001).

Rationally engineering the favorable properties of polaritons is critically required for the rapidly growing research. Here, we demonstrate the manipulation of nonlinear polaritons with the lithographically defined potential landscapes in monolayer WS2 microcavities. The discretization of photoluminescence dispersions and spatially confined patterns indicate the deterministic on-site localization of polaritons by the artificial mesa cavities. Varying the trapping sizes, the polariton-reservoir interaction strength is enhanced by about six times through managing the polariton–exciton spatial overlap. Meanwhile, the coherence of trapped polaritons is significantly improved due to the spectral narrowing and tailored in a picosecond range. Therefore, our work not only offers a convenient approach to manipulating the nonlinearity and coherence of polaritons but also opens up possibilities for exploring many-body phenomena and developing novel polaritonic devices based on 2D materials. © 2023, Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics (CIOMP), CAS.","","Excitons; Microcavities; Optoelectronic devices; Phonons; Photons; Transition metals; Tungsten compounds; Ambient conditions; Artificial potentials; Deterministics; Discretizations; Exciton-polariton; Optoelectronics devices; Polaritons; Property; Thin semiconductor; Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD); Polariton","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12020101003, 12250710126); Tsinghua University, THU; State Key Laboratory of Low-Dimensional Quantum Physics, SKLLDQP","Q.X. gratefully acknowledges the following funding sources: National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 12020101003, and 12250710126), funding support from the State Key Laboratory of Low-Dimensional Quantum Physics of Tsinghua University and the Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program.

They can be caused by multiple factors such as the expressivity of the ansatz, excessive entanglement, the locality of observables under consideration, or even hardware noise. We propose classical splitting of parametric ansatz circuits to avoid barren plateaus. Classical splitting is realized by subdividing an N qubit ansatz into multiple ansätze that consist of O(log N) qubits. We show that such an approach allows for avoiding barren plateaus and carry out numerical experiments, and perform binary classification on classical and quantum datasets. Moreover, we propose an extension of the ansatz that is compatible with variational quantum simulations. Finally, we discuss a speed-up for gradient-based optimization and hardware implementation, robustness against noise and parallelization, making classical splitting an ideal tool for noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) applications. © 2023, The Author(s).","Ansatz; Barren; Parametric; Plateau","Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Quantum chemistry; Quantum optics; Qubits; Ansatz; Barren; Large-scales; N qubits; Parametric; Plateau; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum system; Splittings; Timing circuits","Future-proofing Scientific Applications for the Supercomputers of Tomorrow; Ministry of Science, Research and Culture of the State of Brandenburg; Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics, FAST, (COMPLEMENTARY/0916/0048, EXCELLENCE/0421/0019); HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme, (101087126); Helmholtz Association; Research and Innovation Foundation, RIF","C.T. and A.C. are supported in part by the Helmholtz Association - “Innopool Project Variational Quantum Computer Simulations (VQCS)”.

However, the native long-range interactions between the atoms complicate experimental analysis and precise theoretical understanding of these systems. Here we use new tensor network algorithms capable of including all long-range interactions to study the ground state phase diagram of Rydberg atoms in a geometrically unfrustrated square lattice array. We find a greatly altered phase diagram from earlier numerical and experimental studies, revealed by studying the phases on the bulk lattice and their analogs in experiment-sized finite arrays. We further describe a previously unknown region with a nematic phase stabilized by short-range entanglement and an order from disorder mechanism. Broadly our results yield a conceptual guide for future experiments, while our techniques provide a blueprint for converging numerical studies in other lattices. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","algorithm; experimental study; lattice dynamics; numerical model; quantum mechanics; two-dimensional modeling; algorithm; article; experimental study","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2102505, DEG-1745301); Resnick Sustainability Institute for Science, Energy and Sustainability, California Institute of Technology","Funding text 1: We thank M.

Through reservoir engineering, we show that a structured dissipation can stabilize a two-component SC while autonomously correcting the errors. The implementation of such dissipation only requires low-order nonlinear couplings among three bosonic modes or between a bosonic mode and a qutrit. While our proposed scheme is device independent, it is readily implementable with current experimental platforms such as superconducting circuits and trapped-ion systems. Compared to the stabilized cat, the stabilized SC has a much lower dominant error rate and a significantly enhanced noise bias. Furthermore, the bias-preserving operations for the SC have much lower error rates. In combination, the stabilized SC leads to substantially better logical performance when concatenating with an outer discrete-variable code. The surface-SC scheme achieves more than one order of magnitude increase in the threshold ratio between the loss rate κ 1 and the engineered dissipation rate κ 2. Under a practical noise ratio κ 1/κ 2 = 10−3, the repetition-SC scheme can reach a 10−15 logical error rate even with a small mean excitation number of 4, which already suffices for practically useful quantum algorithms. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Bosons; Codes (symbols); Error correction; Quantum theory; Qubits; Bosonic modes; Continous-variable systems; Error rate; Fault-tolerant quantum computation; Low order; Nonlinear coupling; Quantum error correction scheme; Quantum error corrections; Reservoir engineering; Two-component; Trapped ions","ARO MURI, (W911NF-16-1-0349, W911NF-21-1-0325); DoE Q-NEXT; National Science Foundation, NSF, (ERC-1941583, OMA-1936118, OMA-2137642, PHY-1748958); David and Lucile Packard Foundation, DLPF, (2020-71479); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-19-1-0399, FA9550-21-1-0209); Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-18-1-0020, W911NF-18-1-0212, W911NF-19-1-0380); Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL, (FA8649-21-P-0781); NTT Research","We thank Pei Zeng, Ramesh Bhandari, Yvonne Gao, Kyungjoo Noh for helpful discussions.

However, designing a quantum algorithm requires a deep understanding of quantum mechanics and physics procedures. This work presents a generic quantum “black box” for entropy calculation. It does not depend on the data type and can be applied to building and maintaining machine learning models. The method has two main advantages. First, it is accessible to those without preliminary knowledge of quantum computing. Second, it is based on the quantum circuit with a constant depth of three, which is equivalent to three operations the circuit would perform to achieve the same result. We implemented our method using the IBM simulator and tested it over different types of input.

We here show that a grain boundary (GB) defect can host a topological superconductor (SC), with a pair of cohabitating MZMs at its end when immersed in a parent two-dimensional gapped topological SC with the Fermi surface enclosing a nonzero momentum. The essence of our proposal lies in the magnetic-field driven hybridization of the localized MZMs at the elementary blocks of the GB defect, the single lattice dislocations, due to the MZM spin being locked to the Burgers vector. Indeed, as we show through numerical and analytical calculations, the GB topological SC with two localized MZMs emerges in a finite range of both the angle and magnitude of the external magnetic field. Our work demonstrates the possibility of defect-based platforms for quantum information technology and opens up a route for their systematic search in future. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Grain boundaries; Magnetic fields; Quantum optics; Search engines; Topology; Condensed-matter physics; Grain-boundaries; Grain-boundary defects; Hybridisation; Localised; Magnetic-field; Majorana; Nonzero momenta; Quantum Information; Two-dimensional; Superconducting materials","Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (VR 2019-04735); NordForsk","The authors acknowledge support of the Swedish Research Council (Grant No. VR 2019-04735 of V.J.).

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as crucial regulators of diverse biological processes. However, lncRNAs in ginger are not yet identified so far, and their potential roles in gingerol biosynthesis are still unknown. In this study, metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed in three main ginger cultivars (leshanhuangjiang, tonglingbaijiang, and yujiang 1 hao) in China to understand the potential roles of the specific lncRNAs in gingerol accumulation. Results: A total of 744 metabolites were monitored by metabolomics analysis, which were divided into eleven categories. Among them, the largest group phenolic acid category contained 143 metabolites, including 21 gingerol derivatives. Of which, three gingerol analogs, [8]-shogaol, [10]-gingerol, and [12]-shogaol, accumulated significantly. Moreover, 16,346 lncRNAs, including 2,513, 1,225, and 2,884 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNA genes (DELs), were identified in all three comparisons by transcriptomic analysis. Gene ontology enrichment (GO) analysis showed that the DELs mainly enriched in the secondary metabolite biosynthetic process, response to plant hormones, and phenol-containing compound metabolic process. Correlation analysis revealed that the expression levels of 11 DE gingerol biosynthesis enzyme genes (GBEGs) and 190 transcription factor genes (TF genes), such as MYB1, ERF100, WRKY40, etc. were strongly correlation coefficient with the contents of the three gingerol analogs. Furthermore, 7 and 111 upstream cis-acting lncRNAs, 1,200 and 2,225 upstream trans-acting lncRNAs corresponding to the GBEGs and TF genes were identified, respectively. Interestingly, 1,184 DELs might function as common upstream regulators to these GBEGs and TFs genes, such as LNC_008452, LNC_006109, LNC_004340, etc. Furthermore, protein–protein interaction networks (PPI) analysis indicated that three TF proteins, MYB4, MYB43, and WRKY70 might interact with four GBEG proteins (PAL1, PAL2, PAL3, and 4CL-4). Conclusion: Based on these findings, we for the first time worldwide proposed a putative regulatory cascade of lncRNAs, TFs genes, and GBEGs involved in controlling of gingerol biosynthesis. These results not only provide novel insights into the lncRNAs involved in gingerol metabolism, but also lay a foundation for future in-depth studies of the related molecular mechanism. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Ginger; Gingerol biosynthesis; Long non-coding RNAs; Metabolomics; Transcriptomics","Ginger; Metabolomics; RNA, Long Noncoding; Transcriptome; (10) gingerol; acetate coenzyme A ligase; cinnamate 4 monooxygenase; cis acting element; gingerol; long non coding RNA LNC 004340; long non coding RNA LNC 006109; long non coding RNA LNC008452; long untranslated RNA; phenol; phenol derivative; phenylalanine ammonia lyase; phytohormone; protein Myb; shogaol; trans acting factor; transcription factor; transcription factor MYB43; transcription factor WRKY70; unclassified drug; gingerol; long untranslated RNA; shogaol; transcriptome; Article; biosynthesis; China; controlled study; correlation analysis; correlation coefficient; cultivar; differential gene expression; ERF100 gene; gene expression level; gene identification; gene ontology; gene set enrichment analysis; ginger; high throughput sequencing; leshanhuangjiang; metabolite; metabolomics; MYB1 gene; nonhuman; plant gene; plant metabolism; plant response; rhizome; RNA gene; tonglingbaijiang; transcriptomics; WRKY40 gene; yujiang 1 hao; genetics; metabolomics","Chongqing Municipal Technology Innovation and Application Development Project, (cstc2019jscx-dxwtBX0028); Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences Natural Science Major Cultivation Project, (2021XM3050, P2022LS14); Wuhan Metware Biotechnology Co., Ltd.; Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, CQMEC, (KJZD-K202001304, KJZD-M202101301)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Science and Technology Project of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (grant number KJZD-K202001304 and KJZD-M202101301); the Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences Natural Science Major Cultivation Project (grant number P2022LS14); Special Grant for Chongqing Postdoctoral Researcher Research Project (grant number 2021XM3050); Chongqing Municipal Technology Innovation and Application Development Project (grant number cstc2019jscx-dxwtBX0028). ; Funding text 2: We would like to thank Editage (www.editage.cn) for English language editing.

In this work we study experimentally vortex-based superconducting memory cells. Three main results are obtained. First, we test scalability and demonstrate that the cells can be straightforwardly miniaturized to submicron sizes. Second, we emphasize the importance of conscious geometrical engineering. In the studied devices we introduce an asymmetric easy track for vortex motion and show that it enables a controllable manipulation of vortex states. Finally, we perform a detailed analysis of word and bit line operation of a 1 × 1 μm2 cell. High-endurance, non-volatile operation at zero magnetic field is reported. Remarkably, we observe that the combined word and bit line threshold current is significantly reduced compared to the bare word-line operation. This could greatly improve the selectivity of individual cell addressing in a multi-cell RAM. The achieved one square micron area is an important milestone and a significant step forward towards creation of a dense cryogenic memory. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","fuel cell; magnetic field; vortex; article; controlled study; endurance; human cell; magnetic field; memory; memory cell; vortex motion","Vetenskapsrådet, VR; Stockholms Universitet, SU","Funding text 1: The work was supported by the Swedish Research Council.

It has been difficult to obtain photorealistic (clean or clear) CT images due to various unwanted artifacts generated during the CT scanning process, along with the limitations of back-projection algorithms. Recently, an iterative optimization algorithm has been developed that uses an entire sinogram to reduce errors caused by artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new quantum algorithm for reconstructing CT images. This algorithm can be used with any type of light source as long as the projection is defined. Assuming an experimental sinogram produced by a Radon transform, to find the CT image of this sinogram, we express the CT image as a combination of qubits. After acquiring the Radon transform of the undetermined CT image, we combine the actual sinogram and the optimized qubits. The global energy optimization value used here can determine the value of qubits through a gate model quantum computer or quantum annealer. In particular, the new algorithm can also be used for cone-beam CT image reconstruction and for medical imaging. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2020M3H3A111036513); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This research was supported by the quantum computing technology development program of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Korean government (Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)) (Grant No. 2020M3H3A111036513).

The required understanding of the intricate relationship between nanoscale crystal structure and the properties of the resulting plasmonic resonances remains, however, elusive for these materials. Specifically, edge- and surface-induced plasmonic resonances, and other collective excitations, are often buried beneath the continuum of electronic transitions, making it difficult to isolate and interpret these signals using techniques such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). Here we focus on the experimentally clean energy-gain EELS region to characterise collective excitations in the topologically insulating material Bi2Te3 and correlate them with the underlying crystalline structure with nanoscale resolution. We identify with high significance the presence of a distinct energy-gain peak around −0.8eV, with spatially-resolved maps revealing that its intensity is markedly enhanced at the edge regions of the specimen. Our findings illustrate the reach of energy-gain EELS analyses to accurately map collective excitations in quantum materials, a key asset in the quest towards new tunable plasmonic devices. © 2023 The Author(s)","Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> ; Collective excitations; Electron energy-loss spectroscopy; Energy-gain peaks; Topological insulators","Bismuth compounds; Crystal structure; Dissociation; Electric insulators; Electron emission; Electron scattering; Electrons; Energy dissipation; Nanotechnology; Plasmonics; Quantum computers; Tellurium compounds; Topological insulators; Collective excitations; Electron energy-loss spectroscopies; Electrons energy; Energy gain; Energy-gain peak; Gain peaks; Plasmonic resonances; Spatially resolved; Topological insulators; Tunables; article; crystal structure; electron energy loss spectroscopy; excitation; Electron energy loss spectroscopy","ASDI; European Research Council, ERC, (805021); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","H.

This goal can be achieved through feature selection methods that endeavor to get rid of redundant and irrelevant features to ameliorate classification accuracy. This is the aim of this work where a new meta-heuristic, referred to as snake optimizer, was adopted for the purpose of boosting the performance of existing feature selection methods. This optimizer may smoothly fall into local optimal solutions, which may present weak search performance and slow convergence speeds in handling feature selection problems. On this basis, this paper presents three improved adaptive versions of this optimizer, each of which has increased search performance over the basic optimizer. This optimizer was improved using three mathematical models named exponential, power, and delayed S-shaped, to create three methods, referred to as exponential, power, and delayed S-shaped snake optimizers, respectively. These proposed versions were also matured to have more balance between exploration and exploitation aspects. Then, binary variants of these optimizers were evolved to solve feature selection problems using the k-nearest neighbor classifier. To verify the efficacy of these binary optimizers, 24 datasets were used, and then compared with other feature selection optimizers. The experimental results obviously manifested the efficiency of the proposed optimizers in realizing the optimal feature set by achieving utmost accuracy and minimal number of features in the majority of the studied datasets. The proposed binary power snake optimizer outperformed all other competitors in 13, 10, 8, 8, and 12 datasets in respect of classification accuracy, number of chosen attributes, specificity, sensitivity, and fitness scores, respectively.

When mathematically defining an entanglement measure, we should consider the distinguishability between entangled and separable states, the invariance under local transformation, the monotonicity under local operations and classical communication, and the convexity. These are reasonable requirements but may be insufficient, in particular when taking into account the usefulness of quantum states in multi-party quantum information processing. Therefore, if we want to investigate multipartite entanglement as a resource, then it can be necessary to consider the usefulness of quantum states in multi-party quantum information processing when we define a multipartite entanglement measure. In this paper, we define new multipartite entanglement measures for three-qubit systems based on the three-party teleportation capability, and show that these entanglement measures satisfy the requirements for being genuine multipartite entanglement measures. We also generalize our entanglement measures for N-qubit systems, where N≥ 4 , and discuss that these quantities may be good candidates to measure genuine multipartite entanglement. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","article; quantitative analysis","Quantum Information Science R &D Ecosystem, (2022M3H3A106307411); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (IITP-2023-2018-0-01402, NRF-2022R1C1C2006396, NRF-2022R1F1A1068197); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2022M3K2A1083890)","M.C. acknowledges support from the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea grant funded by the Korea Government (Grant No. NRF-2022M3K2A1083890), E.B. acknowledges support from the NRF of Korea Grant funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) (Grant No. NRF-2022R1C1C2006396), and S.L. acknowledges support from the NRF Grant funded by the MSIT (Grant No. NRF-2022R1F1A1068197), the MSIT, Korea, under the Information Technology Research Center support program (Grant No. IITP-2023-2018-0-01402) supervised by the Institute for Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation and the Creation of the Quantum Information Science R &D Ecosystem (Grant No. 2022M3H3A106307411) through the NRF funded by the MSIT.

KTS is thought to lie on the PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum, but reports are limited. PIK3CA encodes p110α, a catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) that plays an essential role in the PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. We aimed to demonstrate the clinical utility of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) in identifying PIK3CA mosaicism in archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from patients with KTS. Results: Participants were 9 female and 5 male patients with KTS diagnosed as capillaro-venous malformation (CVM) or capillaro-lymphatico-venous malformation (CLVM). Median age at resection was 14 years (range, 5–57 years). Median archival period before DNA extraction from FFPE tissues was 5.4 years (range, 3–7 years). NGS-based sequencing of PIK3CA achieved an amplicon mean coverage of 119,000x. PIK3CA missense mutations were found in 12 of 14 patients (85.7%; 6/8 CVM and 6/6 CLVM), with 8 patients showing the hotspot variants E542K, E545K, H1047R, and H1047L. The non-hotspot PIK3CA variants C420R, Q546K, and Q546R were identified in 4 patients. Overall, the mean variant allele frequency for identified PIK3CA variants was 6.9% (range, 1.6–17.4%). All patients with geographic capillary malformation, histopathological lymphatic malformation or macrodactyly of the foot had PIK3CA variants. No genotype–phenotype association between hotspot and non-hotspot PIK3CA variants was found. Histologically, the vessels and adipose tissues of the lesions showed phosphorylation of the proteins in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, including p-AKT, p-mTOR, and p-4EBP1. Conclusions: The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in mesenchymal tissues was activated in patients with KTS. Amplicon-based targeted NGS could identify low-level mosaicism from low-input DNA extracted from FFPE tissues, potentially providing a diagnostic option for personalized medicine with inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. © 2023, Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM).","Capillary malformations; High-throughput nucleotide sequencing; Klippel–Trenaunay Syndrome; Limb hypertrophy; Lymphatic abnormalities; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum; Segmental hypertrophy; Vascular malformations; Venous malformations","Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Female; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome; Male; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; formaldehyde; genomic DNA; initiation factor 4E binding protein 1; mammalian target of rapamycin; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate 3 kinase; protein kinase B; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate 3 kinase; PIK3CA protein, human; protein kinase B; target of rapamycin kinase; adipose tissue; adolescent; adult; age; Akt signaling; amplicon; angioosteohypertrophy syndrome; Article; Asian; blood vessel; child; clinical article; cohort analysis; congenital blood vessel malformation; controlled study; DNA extraction; excision; female; gene frequency; gene identification; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic variability; genotype phenotype correlation; high throughput sequencing; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; lymphatic malformation; macrodactyly; male; microangiopathy; middle aged; missense mutation; mosaicism; paraffin embedding; personalized medicine; PIK3CA gene; preschool child; protein domain; protein phosphorylation; retrospective study; school child; young adult; angioosteohypertrophy syndrome; genetics; high throughput sequencing","Mayumi Shitamichi; Japan Intractable Diseases Research Foundation, JIDRF, (2020B03); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP18K16974)","Funding text 1: We are grateful to all the patients for their invaluable participation.

Serotyping is the most common method used to type G. parasuis isolates. However, the high number of non-typables (NT) and low discriminatory power make serotyping problematic. In this study, 218 field clinical isolates and 15 G. parasuis reference strains were whole-genome sequenced (WGS). Multilocus sequence types (MLST), serotypes, core-genome phylogeny, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, and putative virulence gene information was extracted. Results: In silico WGS serotyping identified 11 of 15 serotypes. The most frequently detected serotypes were 7, 13, 4, and 2. MLST identified 72 sequence types (STs), of which 66 were novel. The most predominant ST was ST454. Core-genome phylogeny depicted 3 primary lineages (LI, LII, and LIII), with LIIIA sublineage isolates lacking all vtaA genes, based on the structure of the phylogenetic tree and the number of virulence genes. At least one group 1 vtaA virulence genes were observed in most isolates (97.2%), except for serotype 8 (ST299 and ST406), 15 (ST408 and ST552) and NT (ST448). A few group 1 vtaA genes were significantly associated with certain serotypes or STs. The putative virulence gene lsgB, was detected in 8.3% of the isolates which were predominantly of serotype 5/12. While most isolates carried the bcr, ksgA, and bacA genes, the following antimicrobial resistant genes were detected in lower frequency; blaZ (6.9%), tetM (3.7%), spc (3.7%), tetB (2.8%), bla-ROB-1 (1.8%), ermA (1.8%), strA (1.4%), qnrB (0.5%), and aph3''Ia (0.5%). Conclusion: This study showed the use of WGS to type G. parasuis isolates and can be considered an alternative to the more labor-intensive and traditional serotyping and standard MLST. Core-genome phylogeny provided the best strain discrimination. These findings will lead to a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology and virulence in G. parasuis that can be applied to the future development of diagnostic tools, autogenous vaccines, evaluation of antibiotic use, prevention, and disease control. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Glaesserella parasuis; Multilocus sequence typing; Phylogeny; Polyserositis; Serotyping; Swine; Whole-genome sequencing","Animals; Haemophilus parasuis; Multilocus Sequence Typing; North America; Phylogeny; Serogroup; Serotyping; Swine; serotyping; Article; bacA gene; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; bacterium identification; bacterium isolate; bacterium isolation; blaZ gene; controlled study; disease control; ermA gene; geographic distribution; Glaesserella parasuis; Gram negative bacterium; histopathology; ksgA gene; lsgB gene; multilocus sequence typing; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phylogenetic tree; pig; polymerase chain reaction; qnrB gene; sequence alignment; serotype; serotyping; single nucleotide polymorphism; spc gene; strA gene; tetB gene; tetM gene; vtaA gene; whole genome sequencing; animal; genetics; Haemophilus parasuis; North America; phylogeny; veterinary medicine","Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory","We acknowledge the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory Bacteriology section for their invaluable work carrying out the bacteriological culture of all study isolates.

QPCs also make highly sensitive electrical amplifiers with the potential to operate in the quantum-limited regime. Though the inherent operational bandwidth of QPCs can eclipse the THz regime, the impedance mismatch with the external circuitry limits the operational frequency to a few kHz. Lumped-element impedance-matching circuits are successful only up to a few hundreds of MHz in frequency. QPCs are characterised by a complex impedance consisting of quantized resistance, capacitance, and inductance elements. Characterising the complex admittance at higher frequencies and understanding the coupling of QPC to other circuit elements and electromagnetic environments will provide valuable insight into its sensing and backaction properties. In this work, we couple a QPC galvanically to a superconducting stub tuner impedance matching circuit realised in a coplanar waveguide architecture to enhance the operation frequency into the GHz regime and investigate the electrical amplification and complex admittance characteristics. The device, operating at ∼ 1.96GHz, exhibits a conductance sensitivity of 2.92×10−5(e2/h)/Hz with a bandwidth of 13MHz. Besides, the RF reflected power unambiguously reveals the complex admittance characteristics of the QPC, shining more light on the behaviour of quantum tunnel junctions at higher operational frequencies. © 2023 The Authors","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA, (DE-NA-0003525); Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST, (MoE-STARS/STARS1/363, ST/ICPS/QuST/Theme-4/2019)","Funding text 1: MT acknowledges the funding support received from DST, Govt. of India under the grand ST/ICPS/QuST/Theme-4/2019 and MoE, STARS under the grand MoE-STARS/STARS1/363.

During their progression, the assembly of these microbial communities occurs under harsh environmental conditions and variable nutrient content due to fast snow melting. To date, it is still unclear what are the ecological mechanisms governing the composition and abundance of microorganisms during the formation of snow algae blooms. In this study, we aim to examine the main ecological mechanisms governing the assembly of snow algae blooms from early stages to colorful stages blooms. Methods: The composition of the microbial communities within snow algae blooms was recorded in the West Antarctic Peninsula (Isabel Riquelme Islet) during a 35-day period using 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA metabarcoding. In addition, the contribution of different ecological processes to the assembly of the microbial community was quantified using phylogenetic bin-based null model analysis. Results: Our results showed that alpha diversity indices of the eukaryotic communities displayed a higher variation during the formation of the algae bloom compared with the bacterial community. Additionally, in a macronutrients rich environment, the content of nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, and organic carbon did not play a major role in structuring the community. The quantification of ecological processes showed that the bacterial community assembly was governed by selective processes such as homogenous selection. In contrast, stochastic processes such as dispersal limitation and drift, and to a lesser extent, homogenous selection, regulate the eukaryotic community. Conclusions: Overall, our study highlights the differences in the microbial assembly between bacteria and eukaryotes in snow algae blooms and proposes a model to integrate both assembly processes.

The developments in quantum technologies have paved the way for applications such as quantum imaging and quantum information processing, including quantum computing and quantum communications proving superior to the conventional technologies currently in use. Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors (SNSPDs) are one of the key elements in these applications and are preferred over similar devices due to their better performance parameters. The instrumentation used for characterizing single-photon detectors must be precise and reliable so that no optical event gets missed. Here, we present an optical setup based on the 2nd-order correlation measurement, developed to characterize single-photon detectors at visible to near-infrared wavelengths. Each device used in the setup has been thoroughly characterized, and their response under different operating conditions has been studied. In the setup, a few photons generated by attenuating a laser are split by a 50:50 fiber beam splitter and sent to two single-photon detectors.

In particular, we consider a hybrid system consisting of a cavity and two charged mechanical oscillators with an OPA, where the optical cavity mode is coupled with a charged mechanical oscillator via radiation pressure, and the two charged mechanical oscillators are coupled through a Coulomb interaction. We use logarithmic negativity to quantify quantum entanglement, and quantum discord to measure the quantumness correlation between the two mechanical oscillators. We characterize quantum steering using the steerability between the two mechanical oscillators. Our results show that the presence of OPA and strong Coulomb coupling enhances the quantum correlations between the two mechanical oscillators. In addition, Coulomb interactions are more prominent in quantum correlations. Besides, in the presence of OPA, the maximum amount of quantum entanglement, quantum steering, and quantum discord were achieved between the two mechanical oscillators is greater than in the absence of OPA. Moreover, a proper phase choice of the optical field driving the OPA enhances quantum correlations under suitable conditions. We obtain quantum entanglement confines quantum steering and quantum discord beyond entanglement. Furthermore, quantum entanglement, quantum steering, and quantum discord decrease rapidly with increasing temperature as a result of decoherence. In addition, quantum discord persists at higher temperature values, although the quantum entanglement between the systems also vanishes completely. Our proposed scheme enhances quantum correlation and proves robust against fluctuations in the bath environment. We believe that the present scheme of quantum correlation provides a promising platform for the realization of continuous variable quantum information processing. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","","","T.G.

Photonic coupled cavity arrays are a promising alternative platform for realizing such simulators, due to their potential for scalability, small size, and high-temperature operability. However, programmability and nonlinearity in photonic cavities remain outstanding challenges. Here, using a silicon photonic coupled cavity array made up of 8 high quality factor (Q up to ~7.1×104) resonators and equipped with specially designed thermo-optic island heaters for independent control of cavities, we demonstrate a programmable photonic cavity array in the telecom regime, implementing tight-binding Hamiltonians with access to the full eigenenergy spectrum. We report a ~ 50 % reduction in the thermal crosstalk between neighboring sites of the cavity array compared to traditional heaters, and then present a control scheme to program the cavity array to a given tight-binding Hamiltonian.

While conventional low-T c superconductors are mainly employed, high-T c cuprates could offer enhanced temperature and magnetic field operating ranges. Here, we report the realization of YBa 2Cu 3O 7-δ superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators, and demonstrate a continuous evolution from a lossy undercoupled regime, to a lossless overcoupled regime by adjusting the device geometry, in good agreement with circuit model theory. A high-quality factor resonator was then used to perform electron spin resonance measurements on a molecular spin ensemble across a temperature range spanning two decades. We observe spin-cavity hybridization indicating coherent coupling between the microwave field and the spins in a highly cooperative regime. The temperature dependence of the Rabi splitting and the spin relaxation time point toward an antiferromagnetic coupling of the spins below 2 K. Our findings indicate that high-Tc superconducting resonators hold great promise for the development of functional circuits. Additionally, they suggest novel approaches for achieving hybrid quantum systems based on high-T c superconductors and for conducting electron spin resonance measurements over a wide range of magnetic fields and temperatures. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","","French RENATECH network; Région Ile-de-France","The authors thank L. de’ Medici and G.

A recent construction developed in 2021 has sparked the field of financial portfolio optimization through the Quantum Walk Optimization Algorithm (QWOA). In this study, we investigated the complexity and efficiency of quantum optimization algorithms with a special interest in QWOA. The objective is to minimize investment risk by having a good combination of assets in the portfolio. We also focused on reducing the number of iterations while attaining a high-quality resolution through contraction of the solution space to ease computations. The concept of QWOA was extended by constructing a newly outperforming scheme known as the “Quantum Mix Optimization Algorithm (QMOA).” QMOA algorithm codes were provided for the implementation and simulation of numerical results. In addition, the efficiency of QMOA, which is better than the existing QCO algorithms, was discussed. For instance, the least QWOA number of computations required to execute the initial state equation was p > 2, whereas this value was p ≥ 2 in the proposed QMOA. © 2023 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.","Combinatorial optimization; Induced tadpole graph; Lattice; Qubits; Trajectory","","","","J.

The study explores both the linear and nonlinear regimes of torque induction. In the linear regime, where the intensity of the vortex beams is weaker than that of the control field, effective control over the induced torque is demonstrated by adjusting parameters such as magnetic field strength, control field intensity, detuning, and dephasing terms between relevant atomic levels. The analysis highlights the significant contribution of the Zeeman shift-induced magnetic field, which enhances the torque and exhibits a distinct sharp peak. Furthermore, higher-order contributions to the induced torque are discussed as the intensity of the probe fields approaches that of the control field, resulting in further enhancement of the induced torque. These findings offer opportunities for precise control over the rotational motion of atoms within the system, with potential applications in precision measurement, quantum information processing, and quantum control. © 2023, The Author(s).","","article; magnetic field; motion; torque","","","A.

In this work, we introduce the inductively shunted transmon, a weakly flux-tunable superconducting qubit that offers charge offset protection for all levels and a 20-fold reduction in flux dispersion compared to the state-of-the-art resulting in a constant coherence over a full flux quantum. The parabolic confinement provided by the inductive shunt as well as the linearity of the geometric superinductor facilitates a high-power readout that resolves quantum jumps with a fidelity and QND-ness of >90% and without the need for a Josephson parametric amplifier. Moreover, the device reveals quantum tunneling physics between the two prepared fluxon ground states with a measured average decay time of up to 3.5 h. In the future, fast time-domain control of the transition matrix elements could offer a new path forward to also achieve full qubit control in the decay-protected fluxon basis. © 2023, The Author(s).","","quantum dot; dispersion; instrumentation; physics; wavelength; Article; comparative study; dispersion; noise; nonhuman; physics; reduction (chemistry)","Institute of Science and Technology Austria, ISTA; Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (BeyondC F7105); NOMIS Stiftung","The authors thank J.

In this work, we explore the potential of quantum computing to solve a simplified version of protein folding. More precisely, we numerically investigate the performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in sampling low-energy conformations of short peptides. We start by benchmarking the algorithm on an even simpler problem: sampling self-avoiding walks. Motivated by promising results, we then apply the algorithm to a more complete version of protein folding, including a simplified physical potential. In this case, we find less promising results: deep quantum circuits are required to achieve accurate results, and the performance of QAOA can be matched by random sampling up to a small overhead. Overall, these results cast serious doubt on the ability of QAOA to address the protein folding problem in the near term, even in an extremely simplified setting. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Optimization; Peptides; Quantum computers; Approximate optimization; Conformational samplings; Low-energy conformations; Optimization algorithms; Performance; Protein foldings; Quantum Computing; Research efforts; Self avoiding walk; Simple++; Protein folding","Google, (EP/S005021/1); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (817581); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/S021582/1); European Research Council, ERC","Funding text 1: This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No. 817581) and was supported by the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Delivering Quantum Technologies, grant ref.

However, the resilience of system topology to external perturbations makes it challenging experimentally to investigate transitions between different phases. In this study, we demonstrate the transitions of a Chern number from 0 to 3, synthesized in an electronic-nuclear spin system associated with the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond. The Chern number is characterized by the number of degeneracies enclosed in a control Hamiltonian parameter sphere. Topological transitions between different phases are realized by varying the radius and offset of the sphere such that the Chern number changes. We show that the measured topological phase diagram is consistent with numerical calculations and can also be mapped onto an interacting three-qubit system. The NV system may also allow access to even higher Chern numbers, which could be applied to exploring exotic topology or topological quantum information. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Quantum optics; Topology; Chern numbers; External perturbations; Hamiltonian parameters; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Nuclear spin system; Physical systems; Synthesised; System topology; Topological phase; Tunabilities; Spin dynamics","ILJU; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1541959); Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-11-1-0400, W911NF-15-1-0548, W911NF-19-2-0181); Army Research Laboratory, ARL; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JPJSBP120238803); Korea Institute of Science and Technology, KIST, (2E32241); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2023K2A9A2A08000191); Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology, PRESTO, (JPMJPR20B1)","The authors would like to thank A.

However, using standard diffraction-limited optical systems, the transverse size of the trap is lower bounded by the optical wavelength, limiting the application range of optical tweezers. Here we report trapping of single ultracold atom in an optical trap that can be continuously tuned from a standard Airy focus to a subwavelength hotspot smaller than the usual Abbe’s diffraction limit. The hotspot was generated using the effect of superoscillations, by the precise interference of multiple free-space coherent waves. We argue that superoscillatory trapping and continuous potential tuning offer not only a way to generate compact and tenable ensembles of trapped atoms for quantum simulators but will also be useful in single molecule quantum chemistry and the study of cooperative atom-photon interactions within subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Atoms; Diffraction; Molecules; Quantum chemistry; Application range; Diffraction limited; Hotspots; Optical trap; Optical wavelength; Single-atoms; Single-particle; Sub-wavelength; Transverse sizes; Ultracold atoms; Optical tweezers","Institut Fresnel; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/T02643X/1); Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE, (MOE2016-T3-1006, RG160/19); Nanyang Technological University, NTU; Centre for Quantum Technologies, CQT, (R-710-002-016271)","The authors thank Eng Aik Chan for his early contribution to the experimental setup and Edward T.F.

In these nonperturbative regimes, a qubit–resonator system has an entangled quantum vacuum with a nonzero average photon number in the resonator, where the photons are virtual and cannot be directly detected. The vacuum field, however, is able to induce the symmetry breaking of a dispersively coupled probe qubit. We experimentally observe the parity symmetry breaking of an ancillary Xmon artificial atom induced by the field of a lumped-element superconducting resonator deep-strongly coupled with a flux qubit. This result opens a way to experimentally explore the novel quantum-vacuum effects emerging in the deep-strong coupling regime. © 2023, The Author(s).","","experimental study; physical phenomena; probe; sensor; symmetry; article; parity; vacuum","ICSC; Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation; PNRR MUR, (PE0000023-NQSTI); SiUCs, (731473); Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF1910065); Foundational Questions Institute, FQxI, (FQXi-IAF19-06); Asian Office of Aerospace Research and Development, AOARD, (FA2386-20-1-4069); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (22H04937); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11934010, 62074091, 92265202, U2230402); Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (JPMJMS2061); Tsinghua University, THU; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFA1405200)","This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2022YFA1405200), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 92265202, No. 11934010, No. 62074091, and No. U2230402), Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program.

For instance, rare quantum tunneling two-level systems (TLS) govern the physics of glasses at very low temperature. Due to their extremely low density, it is very hard to directly identify them in computer simulations. We introduce a machine learning approach to efficiently explore the potential energy landscape of glass models and identify desired classes of defects. We focus in particular on TLS and we design an algorithm that is able to rapidly predict the quantum splitting between any two amorphous configurations produced by classical simulations. This in turn allows us to shift the computational effort towards the collection and identification of a larger number of TLS, rather than the useless characterization of non-tunneling defects which are much more abundant. Finally, we interpret our machine learning model to understand how TLS are identified and characterized, thus giving direct physical insight into their microscopic nature. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Cold Temperature; Glass; Machine Learning; Temperature; Thermodynamics; glass; defect; glass; machine learning; potential energy; tunneling; Article; computer simulation; energy; glass transition temperature; liquid; low temperature; machine learning; molecular dynamics; physics; plasticity; prediction; chemistry; cold; machine learning; temperature; thermodynamics","Herchel Smith Fund; Region Ile de France, (ANR-10-EQPX-29-01); Simons Foundation, SF, (454933, 454951, 454955); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (723955); Leverhulme Trust, (VP1-2019-029); European Research Council, ERC; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR; Sidney Sussex College, University of Cambridge","We thank E.

We hereby propose a CMOS compatible silicon-based sensor that operates at (3.5–10 μm) within the mid infrared range. The silicon material is doped to the level that shifts its plasmonic resonance to 3 μm wavelength. The sensor device comprises an in-line rectangular microcavity and a stub microcavity resonator. The resonance frequencies/wavelengths of the two resonators were studied with different design dimensions. When the two resonators are designed to resonate at close frequencies, the interesting Fano resonance with its distinct and sharp line shape is excited due to the interference between the two resonance profiles. Fano resonance is useful for highly sensitive measurements due to its abrupt intensity changing profile. The sensor is studied and analyzed using Finite Difference Element and 2D Finite Difference Time Domain methods. The sensor's performance is characterized by its high sensitivity of 6000 nm/RIU, FOM of 353, and limited insertion loss of 0.45 dB around 6.5 μm operation wavelength. Furthermore, we develop the sensor for simultaneously detecting formaldehyde CH2O and nitrous oxide N2O gases from their strong absorption bands at 3.6 μm and 4.46 μm wavelengths, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","","","M.A. Swillam; Department of Physics, School of Science and Engineering, The American University in Cairo, Cairo, 11835, Egypt; email: m.swillam@aucegypt.edu","","Nature Research","20452322","","","37516742","English","Sci.

In this work, we present a general framework for preparing ground states of many-body systems by combining the measurement-feedback control process (MFCP) with machine learning techniques. Specifically, we employ Bayesian optimization (BO) to enhance the efficiency of determining the measurement and feedback operators within the MFCP. As an illustration, we study the ground state preparation of the one-dimensional Bose–Hubbard model. Through BO, we are able to identify optimal parameters that can effectively drive the system towards low-energy states with a high probability across various quantum trajectories.

However, whether this URT dysbiosis associates with the viral species (in other words, is viral type-specific) is unclear. Results: Here, we recruited 735 outpatients with upper respiratory symptoms, identified the infectious virus types in 349 participants using multiplex RT-PCR, and profiled their upper respiratory microbiome using the 16S ribosomal RNA gene and metagenomic gene sequencing. Microbial and viral data were subsequently used as inputs for multivariate analysis aimed at revealing viral type-specific disruption of the upper respiratory microbiota. We found that the oropharyngeal microbiota shaped by influenza A virus (FluA), influenza B virus (FluB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human rhinovirus (HRV) infections exhibited three distinct patterns of dysbiosis, and Veillonella was identified as a prominent biomarker for any type of respiratory viral infections. Influenza virus infections are significantly correlated with increased oropharynx microbiota diversity and enrichment of functional metabolic pathways such as L-arginine biosynthesis and tetracycline resistance gene tetW. We used the GRiD algorithm and found the predicted growth rate of common respiratory pathogens was increased upon influenza virus infection, while commensal bacteria, such as Streptococcus infantis and Streptococcus mitis, may act as a colonization resistance to the overgrowth of these pathogens. Conclusions: We found that respiratory viral infections are linked with viral type-specific disruption of the upper respiratory microbiota, particularly, influenza infections uniquely associated with increased microbial diversity and growth rates of specific pathogens in URT. These findings are essential for clarifying the differences and dynamics of respiratory microbiota in healthy participants and acute respiratory viral infections, which contribute to elucidating the pathogenesis of viral-host-bacterial interactions to provide insights into future studies on effective prevention and treatment of respiratory tract infections.

In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing era, this is a significant challenge given quantum resources are scarce and typically only low-depth quantum circuits can be implemented on physical devices. We present a genetic algorithm for state preparation (GASP) which generates relatively low-depth quantum circuits for initialising a quantum computer in a specified quantum state. The method uses a basis set of Rx , Ry , Rz , and CNOT gates and a genetic algorithm to systematically generate circuits to synthesize the target state to the required fidelity. GASP can produce more efficient circuits of a given accuracy with lower depth and gate counts than other methods. This variability of the required accuracy facilitates overall higher accuracy on implementation, as error accumulation in high-depth circuits can be avoided. We directly compare the method to the state initialisation technique based on an exact synthesis technique by implemented in IBM Qiskit simulated with noise and implemented on physical IBM Quantum devices. Results achieved by GASP outperform Qiskit’s exact general circuit synthesis method on a variety of states such as Gaussian states and W-states, and consistently show the method reduces the number of gates required for the quantum circuits to generate these quantum states to the required accuracy. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; University of Melbourne, UNIMELB","This research was supported by the University of Melbourne through the establishment of the IBM Quantum Network Hub at the University.

Firstly, the total Hamiltonian of the circuit is derived, and the dynamic equation of the motion contributed is examined using the Heisenberg-Langevin equation. Using the nonlinear Hamiltonian, some components are attached to the intrinsic internal circuit of InP HEMT to address the circuit characteristics fully. The components attached are arisen due to the nonlinearity effects. As a result, the theoretical calculations show that the states generated in the circuit are mixed, and no pure state is produced. Accordingly, the modified circuit generates the two-mode squeezed thermal state, which means one can focus on calculating the Gaussian quantum discord to evaluate quantum correlation. It is also found that the nonlinearity factors (addressed as the nonlinear components in the circuit) can intensely influence the squeezed thermal state by which the quantum discord is changed. Finally, as the primary point, it is concluded that although it is possible to enhance the quantum correlation between modes by engineering the nonlinear components; however, attaining quantum discord greater than unity, entangled microwave photons, seems a challenging task since InP HEMT operates at 4.2 K. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","","","A.

Only for a few idealized scenarios, there are analytic results for the optimal measurement set for QST. E.g., in a setting of non-degenerate measurements, an optimal minimal set of measurement operators for QST has eigenbases which are mutually unbiased. However, in other set-ups, dependent on the rank of the projection operators and the size of the quantum system, the optimal choice of measurements for efficient QST needs to be numerically approximated. We have generalized this problem by introducing the framework of customized efficient QST. Here we extend customized QST and look for the optimal measurement set for QST in the case where some of the quantum gates applied in the measurement process are noisy. To achieve this, we use two distinct noise models: first, the depolarizing channel, and second, over- and under-rotation in single-qubit and to two-qubit gates (for further information, please see Methods). We demonstrate the benefit of using entangling gates for the efficient QST measurement schemes for two qubits at realistic noise levels, by comparing the fidelity of reconstruction of our optimized QST measurement set to the state-of-the-art scheme using only product bases. © 2023, The Author(s).","High-dimensional optimization problem; Noise; Quantum computing; Quantum gates; Quantum tomography","Quantum channel; Quantum optics; Qubits; Tomography; High-dimensional optimization; High-dimensional optimization problem; Measurement sets; Noise; Optimal measurements; Optimization problems; Quantum Computing; Quantum gates; Quantum state tomography; Quantum tomography; Logic gates","Bulgarian National Science Fund, BNSF, (KP-06-M 32/1); Universität Konstanz","This work was partially supported by the Zukunftskolleg (University of Konstanz) and the Bulgarian National Science Fund under the contract No KP-06-M 32/1.

They are widely used to determine links for capacity enhancement, link closures to schedule maintenance, identify new road or transit links and more generally network enhancements under resource constraints. As changes in network capacities result in a redistribution of demand on the network, resulting in changes in the congestion patterns, TNDP is generally modelled as a bi-level problem, which is known to be NP-hard. Meta-heuristic methods, such as Tabu Search Method are relied upon to solve these problems, which have been demonstrated to achieve near optimality in reasonable time. The advent of quantum computing has afforded an opportunity to solve these problems faster. We formulate the TNDP problem as a bi-level problem, with the upper level formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem that is solved using quantum annealing on a D-Wave quantum computer. We compare the results with Tabu Search. We find that quantum annealing provides significant computational benefit.

In this work we implement a digital simulation of the discrete time quantum dynamics of a spin- 12 XXZ spin chain on a noisy near-term quantum device, and we extract the high temperature transport exponent at the isotropic point. We simulate the temporal decay of the relevant spin correlation function at high temperature using a pseudo-random state generated by a random circuit that is specifically tailored to the ibmq-montreal 27 qubit device. The resulting output is a spin excitation on a homogeneous background on a 21 qubit chain on the device. From the subsequent discrete time dynamics on the device we are able to extract an anomalous super-diffusive exponent consistent with the conjectured Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling at the isotropic point.

The proposed QUBO formulation was conceived to be employed in quantum annealing—a quantum computing paradigm useful for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Quantum annealing is expected to provide better and/or faster solutions to optimization problems when compared to the ones provided by classical computers. With the problem at stake, better solutions result in lower energy losses, and faster solutions contribute to the same outcome given the future need for frequent reconfiguration of distribution networks to accommodate highly volatile demand, as anticipated by recent low-carbon solutions. The paper presents the results obtained through a hybrid quantum-classical solver for a standard 33-node test network and compares them with the ones obtained from classical solvers. Our main conclusion is that quantum annealing has potential to show advantage in the near future in terms of solution quality and time-to-solution, as quantum annealers and hybrid solvers continue to improve their performance. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/50008/2020, UIDB/50021/2020); European Social Fund, ESF, (SFRH/BD/143402/2019)","This work was supported by Portuguese national funds through Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) with references UIDB/50021/2020 and UIDB/50008/2020.

One approach is to keep supplementary computations in the CPU, and use the QPU only for the core of the problem. In this work, we address the complexity of quantum algorithms of arbitrary quantum state initialization. QPUs do not outperform classical machines with existing precise initialization algorithms. Hence, many studies propose an approximate but robust quantum state initialization. Cutting a quantum state into a product of (almost) independent partitions with the help of CPU reduces the number of two-qubit gates, and correspondingly minimizes the loss of state fidelity in the quantum part of the algorithm. To find the least entangled qubits, current methods compute the singular value decomposition (SVD) for each qubit separately using the CPU. In this paper, we optimize CPU usage and memory resource bottlenecks. We consider Tucker tensor decomposition as an alternative to the CPU-based SVD in a single low-entangled qubit detection task without loss of solution quality. An iterative implementation of Tucker tensor decomposition replaces explicit applications of SVD as proposed in Araujo et al. (2021). This improvement gives both a theoretical and practical time complexity reduction for the circuit-preparation part of quantum algorithms working with vector data. We propose two implementations of our method; both of them outperform the SVD in time and memory for systems of at least ten qubits. We achieve an order faster implementation and two orders less memory usage for a system of 15 qubits. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","NISQ; Quantum state preparation; Tensor decomposition; Tucker decomposition","Computational complexity; Iterative methods; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Qubits; Tensors; 'current; Entangled qubits; NISQ; Processing units; Quantum algorithms; Quantum state; Quantum state preparation; Tensor approximation; Tensor decomposition; Tucker decompositions; Singular value decomposition","","","P.

With the development of quantum computing in recent years, quantum machine learning has shown great potential in a wide range of areas. This paper proposes a hybrid quantum computing based carbon price forecasting framework using an improved quantum machine learning model. The proposed linear-layer-enhanced Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (L-QLSTM) model employs the linear layers before and after the variational quantum circuits of Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM), to extract features, reduce the number of quantum bits and amplify the quantum advantages. The parameter sharing method of the linear layer and the strongly entangled controlled-Z quantum circuit of the variational layer are applied to reduce the parameters and improve the learning performance respectively. We test and evaluate the L-QLSTM based on the practical data of European Union Emission Trading from 2017 to 2020. Results show that the proposed L-QLSTM method can greatly improve the learning accuracy compared to the QLSTM method. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon price forecasting; Hybrid quantum computing; Quantum long short-term memory; Quantum machine learning; Variational quantum circuit","Carbon; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Investments; Long short-term memory; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Timing circuits; Carbon price; Carbon price forecasting; Hybrid quantum computing; Machine-learning; Price forecasting; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum long short-term memory; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Variational quantum circuit; Brain","Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42105145, 71931003, 72061147004, 72171206, 72192805); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2023A1515011438)","This research work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 71931003, 72061147004, 72171206, 72192805, 42105145; Guangdong Province Natural Science Foundation (No. 2023A1515011438); Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society.

These elements are expensive, bulky, consume substantial power, and often rely on free-space I/O channels, all of which pose scaling challenges. To support many-ion systems like trapped-ion quantum computers or miniaturized deployable devices like clocks and sensors, these elements must ultimately be microfabricated, ideally monolithically with the trap to avoid losses associated with optical coupling between physically separate components. In this work we design, fabricate, and test an optical modulator capable of monolithic integration with a surface-electrode ion trap. These devices consist of piezo-optomechanical photonic integrated circuits configured as multi-stage Mach-Zehnder modulators that are used to control the intensity of light delivered to a single trapped ion on a separate chip. We use quantum tomography employing hundreds of multi-gate sequences to enhance the sensitivity of the fidelity to the types and magnitudes of gate errors relevant to quantum computing and better characterize the performance of the modulators, ultimately measuring single qubit gate fidelities that exceed 99.7%. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Light modulation; Light modulators; Optical signal processing; Quantum optics; Qubits; Tomography; Free spaces; High-fidelity; Ion qubits; Ion-atom; Neutral atoms; Phase frequency; Photonic modulators; Power; Scalings; Trapped ion; Trapped ions","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA, (DE-NA0003525); Advanced Scientific Computing Research, ASCR","We thank Kevin Young and Stefan Seritan for their contributions to developing the physical model GST method and Brian McFarland for help with the standard GST analysis.

Key features such as its non-invasive nature and the ability to process information on nuclear spins by versatile quantum control designs with electromagnetic fields, have made NMR to become a powerful technique for sensing systems from atomic and molecular scales with spectroscopy to millimeters in imaging. This brief overview provides quantum sensing tools with which we are contributing from Latin America, by combining quantum dynamical control and estimation strategies with NMR methods to probe physical, chemical, and biological processes. It introduces the basic and key concepts on how controlled spin-sensors can monitor the correlation dynamics of their environment, and selectively and optimally infer its relevant parameters. Then these concepts are illustrated with state-of-the-art implementations for characterizing (i) biological tissue microstructure with diffusion weighting imaging, (ii) quantum information dynamics and scrambling in out-of-equilibrium systems with solid-state NMR quantum simulations, and (iii) molecular structures by selective estimation of spin–spin couplings and online learning control designs with experimental proposals. We expect these concepts will motivate the development of quantum dynamical control of spin sensors to monitor systems in a variety of fields, and in particular to exploit the non-invasive strength of NMR, e.g. in biomedical diagnosis. © 2023 The Author(s)","Diffusion weighted imaging; Dynamics of quantum information; Online learning quantum designs; Quantum decoherence; Quantum sensing","","","","G.A.

The interplay between these two fast-growing fields gives rise to a new research frontier of quantum machine learning. In this work, we report an experimental demonstration of training deep quantum neural networks via the backpropagation algorithm with a six-qubit programmable superconducting processor. We experimentally perform the forward process of the backpropagation algorithm and classically simulate the backward process. In particular, we show that three-layer deep quantum neural networks can be trained efficiently to learn two-qubit quantum channels with a mean fidelity up to 96.0% and the ground state energy of molecular hydrogen with an accuracy up to 93.3% compared to the theoretical value. In addition, six-layer deep quantum neural networks can be trained in a similar fashion to achieve a mean fidelity up to 94.8% for learning single-qubit quantum channels. Our experimental results indicate that the number of coherent qubits required to maintain does not scale with the depth of the deep quantum neural network, thus providing a valuable guide for quantum machine learning applications with both near-term and future quantum devices. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Algorithms; Computing Methodologies; Hydrogen; Neural Networks, Computer; Quantum Theory; hydrogen; quantum dot; algorithm; hydrogen; machine learning; quantum mechanics; research work; accuracy; Article; artificial neural network; back propagation; deep neural network; energy; ground state energy; learning; machine learning; quantum chemistry; simulation training; theoretical study; training; algorithm; computer analysis; quantum theory","Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies, (AHY130200); Institute for Guo Qiang; Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11874235, 11874342, 11922411, 11925404, 12061131011, 12075128, 92165209, T2225008); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2019GQG1024, BX2021167); Tsinghua University, THU; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFA0304303); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B0303030001)","We thank Wenjie Jiang for the helpful discussions.

Conversely, unintended coupling to phonons degrades qubit performance and can lead to correlated errors in superconducting qubit systems. Regardless of whether phonons play an enabling or deleterious role, they do not typically admit control over their spectral properties, nor the possibility of engineering their dissipation to be used as a resource. Here we show that coupling a superconducting qubit to a bath of piezoelectric surface acoustic wave phonons enables a novel platform for investigating open quantum systems. By shaping the loss spectrum of the qubit via the bath of lossy surface phonons, we demonstrate preparation and dynamical stabilization of superposition states through the combined effects of drive and dissipation. These experiments highlight the versatility of engineered phononic dissipation and advance the understanding of mechanical losses in superconducting qubit systems. © 2023, The Author(s).","","quantum dot; acoustic wave; engineering; performance assessment; spectral analysis; stabilization; vibration; wavelength; Article; cross coupling reaction; dispersion; phonon; spectroscopy","National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMR-2003815, ECCS-2142846); University of Washington, UW, (PHY-1752844); Midwestern State University, MSU","We thank M.I.

Common quantum gates found in these systems are: phase shift, displacement, and squeezing gates. These gates are all unitary and reversible. Outside of quantum systems, coherent states also plays a significant role in coherent optical communications with speeds of hundreds of gigabits per second. Secure optical communications is generally implemented at the data layer with classical symmetric encryption such as Advanced Standard Encryption or AES. This inevitably allows any wiretapping to capture the transmitted data either in the plaintext mode or in the encrypted ciphertext mode in the optical infrastructure. The recent and rapid developments in Quantum computing further lift up the need for quantum secure communications in the optical infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel quantum encryption in the coherent optical domain utilizing a displacement operator and implementing with IQ-MZM optical modules, called Quantum Encryption in Phase Space or QEPS. The communication peers share a secret used to seed cryptographic pseudo random number generators to produce a synchronized random number at both the transmitter and receiver. The synchronized random numbers are used to establish displacement operators to encrypt the coherent states at the transmission and decrypt the cipher coherent states at the receiver. Therefore, malicious parties tapping along the fibre line would not extract the message in transit from optical domain due to a high Bit Error Rate or BER. The optimal displacement operator is split into a standard 16-QAM and a random phase shift operator to enhance the transmission security. We analysis the transmission security with the wiretap channel model for semantic security. We have simulated the QEPS encryption and decryption for two data modulation schemes: QPSK and 16-QAM over 80 km for transmission speeds of 56 Gbps for QPSK and 112 Gbps for 16-QAM. © 2023, The Author(s).","Coherent Detection; Coherent State; Digital Signal Processing or DSP; Displacement Operator; IQ-MZM; Phase Shift Operator; QKD; QPP; QPSK; Quadrature Amplitude Modulation or QAM; Quantum Communication; Quantum Decryption; Quantum Encryption; Symmetric cryptography; Symmetric encryption","Bit error rate; Number theory; Optical communication; Quadrature amplitude modulation; Quadrature phase shift keying; Quantum communication; Quantum cryptography; Quantum optics; Random number generation; Semantics; Coherent detection; Coherent state; Digital signal processing or DSP; Displacement operators; IQ-MZM; Phase shift operator; QKD; QPP; Quadrature amplitude modulation or QAM; Quantum decryption; Quantum encryption; Shift operators; Symmetric cryptography; Symmetric encryption; Digital signal processing","","","R.

Recent work has established guarantees for in-distribution generalization of quantum neural networks (QNNs), where training and testing data are drawn from the same data distribution. However, there are currently no results on out-of-distribution generalization in QML, where we require a trained model to perform well even on data drawn from a different distribution to the training distribution. Here, we prove out-of-distribution generalization for the task of learning an unknown unitary. In particular, we show that one can learn the action of a unitary on entangled states having trained only product states. Since product states can be prepared using only single-qubit gates, this advances the prospects of learning quantum dynamics on near term quantum hardware, and further opens up new methods for both the classical and quantum compilation of quantum circuits. © 2023, The Author(s).","","quantum dot; artificial neural network; data interpretation; hardware; machine learning; training; Article; artificial neural network; controlled study; decomposition; learning theory; prediction error; quantum neural network; transfer of learning","Department of Energy Computational Science, (DE-SC0020347); German Academic Scholarship Foundation; PlanQK; Sandoz Family Foundation-Monique de Meuron program for Academic Promotion; TUM Graduate School at the Technical University of Munich; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Advanced Scientific Computing Research, ASCR; Google; Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD, (20210116DR, 20230049DR); Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; Adhesives and Sealant Council, ASC; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz, BMWK; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, DAAD; Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes","We thank Marco Cerezo for helpful conversations.

Currently, selection for resilience is considered a critical step in improving the sustainability of livestock systems. Environmental variance (V E), the within-individual variance of a trait, has been successfully used as a proxy for animal resilience. Selection for reduced V E could effectively shift gut microbiome composition; reshape the inflammatory response, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels; and drive animal resilience. This study aimed to determine the gut microbiome composition underlying the V E of litter size (LS), for which we performed a metagenomic analysis in two rabbit populations divergently selected for low (n = 36) and high (n = 34) V E of LS. Partial least square-discriminant analysis and alpha- and beta-diversity were computed to determine the differences in gut microbiome composition among the rabbit populations. Results: We identified 116 KEGG IDs, 164 COG IDs, and 32 species with differences in abundance between the two rabbit populations studied. These variables achieved a classification performance of the V E rabbit populations of over than 80%. Compared to the high V E population, the low V E (resilient) population was characterized by an underrepresentation of Megasphaera sp., Acetatifactor muris, Bacteroidetes rodentium, Ruminococcus bromii, Bacteroidetes togonis, and Eggerthella sp. and greater abundances of Alistipes shahii, Alistipes putredinis, Odoribacter splanchnicus, Limosilactobacillus fermentum, and Sutterella, among others. Differences in abundance were also found in pathways related to biofilm formation, quorum sensing, glutamate, and amino acid aromatic metabolism. All these results suggest differences in gut immunity modulation, closely related to resilience. Conclusions: This is the first study to show that selection for V E of LS can shift the gut microbiome composition. The results revealed differences in microbiome composition related to gut immunity modulation, which could contribute to the differences in resilience among rabbit populations. The selection-driven shifts in gut microbiome composition should make a substantial contribution to the remarkable genetic response observed in the V E rabbit populations.

However, compared with the corresponding dynamical gates, the robustness of implemented nonadiabatic geometric gates based on the conventional single-loop geometric scheme still has the same order of magnitude due to the requirement of strict multi-segment geometric controls, and the inherent geometric fault-tolerance characteristic is not fully explored. Here, we present an effective geometric scheme combined with a general dynamical-corrected technique, with which the super-robust nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates can be constructed over the conventional single-loop geometric and two-loop composite-pulse geometric strategies, in terms of resisting the systematic error, i.e., σx error. In addition, combined with the decoherence-free subspace (DFS) coding, the resulting geometric gates can also effectively suppress the σz error caused by the collective dephasing. Notably, our protocol is a general one with simple experimental setups, which can be potentially implemented in different quantum systems, such as Rydberg atoms, trapped ions and superconducting qubits. These results indicate that our scheme represents a promising way to explore large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2023, Higher Education Press.","dynamical-corrected gates; fault-tolerant quantum computation; geometric phases","","Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory, (2020B1212060066); High-Level Talent Scientific Research Starting foundation, (2020rcjj14); Outstanding Young Talents in College of Anhui Province, (gxyq2022059); Scientific Research Foundation of Hunan Provincial Education Department, (KJ2021A0649); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12275090); Anhui Provincial Department of Education, (2021cyxy046); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2018B030326001)","This work was supported by the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (Grant No. 2018B030326001), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 12275090), Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory (Grant No. 2020B1212060066), the Quality Engineering Project of the Education Department of Anhui Province (No.2021cyxy046), the key Scientific Research Foundation of Anhui Provincial Education Department (KJ2021A0649), Outstanding Young Talents in College of Anhui Province (Grant No. gxyq2022059), and the High-Level Talent Scientific Research Starting foundation (Grant No. 2020rcjj14).

On the other hand, it is well known that a classical superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) is analogous to the optical double-slit experiment. Here we report experiments and present a model describing a superconducting analogue to the diffraction grating, namely an array of superconducting islands positioned on a topological insulator film Bi0.8Sb1.2Te3. In the limit of an extremely weak field, of the order of one vortex per the entire array, such devices exhibit a critical current peak that is much sharper than the analogous peak of an ordinary SQUID. Therefore, such arrays can be used as sensitive absolute magnetic field sensors. A key finding is that the device acts as a superconducting diode, controlled by magnetic field. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Antimony compounds; Bismuth compounds; Diffraction; Diffraction gratings; Electric insulators; Magnetic fields; Molluscs; Shellfish; Topological insulators; Topology; Diffraction effects; Diode effects; Double-slit experiment; Insulator films; Interference devices; Interference effects; Optical-; Spectroscopic resolution; Superconducting arrays; Topological insulators; SQUIDs","HQAN; NSF OMA-2016136 Quantum Leap Institute for Hybrid Quantum Architectures and Networks; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMR-2104757); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (862660/QUANTUM E-LEAPS)","The work was supported in part by the NSF DMR-2104757 and by the NSF OMA-2016136 Quantum Leap Institute for Hybrid Quantum Architectures and Networks (HQAN).

Accordingly, quantum computers have been predominantly regarded as competitors to only the most accurate and costly classical methods for treating electron correlation. However, here we tighten bounds showing that certain first-quantized quantum algorithms enable exact time evolution of electronic systems with exponentially less space and polynomially fewer operations in basis set size than conventional real-time time-dependent Hartree–Fock and density functional theory. Although the need to sample observables in the quantum algorithm reduces the speedup, we show that one can estimate all elements of the k-particle reduced density matrix with a number of samples scaling only polylogarithmically in basis set size. We also introduce a more efficient quantum algorithm for first-quantized mean-field state preparation that is likely cheaper than the cost of time evolution. We conclude that quantum speedup is most pronounced for finite-temperature simulations and suggest several practically important electron dynamics problems with potential quantum advantage. © 2023, The Author(s).","","algorithm; electron; quantum mechanics; real time; simulation; time dependent behavior; algorithm; article; density functional theory; simulation","National Science Foundation, NSF, (PHY-1748958); Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, KITP; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA, (DE-NA0003525); Sandia National Laboratories, SNL; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP190102633, DP210101367)","The authors thank Alina Kononov, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan, Robin Kothari, Alicia Magann, Fionn Malone, Jarrod McClean, Thomas O’Brien, Nicholas Rubin, Henry Schurkus, Rolando Somma, and Yuan Su for helpful discussions.

However, the biological features of the feline small intestine following T. gondii infection are poorly understood. We investigated the changes in the expression of RNAs (including mRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs) in the small intestinal epithelia of cats following T. gondii infection to improve our understanding of the life cycle of T. gondii and cat responses to T. gondii infection. Methods: Fifteen cats were randomly assigned to five groups, and the infection groups were inoculated with 600 tissue cysts of the T. gondii Pru strain by gavage. The small intestinal epithelia of cats were collected at 6, 10, 14, and 30 days post infection (DPI). Using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we investigated the changes in RNA expression. The expression levels of differentially expressed (DE) genes and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) identified by RNA-seq were validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Differential expression was determined using the DESeq R package. Results: In total, 207 annotated lncRNAs, 20,552 novel lncRNAs, 3342 novel circRNAs and 19,409 mRNAs were identified. Among these, 70 to 344 DE mRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs were detected, and the post-cleavage binding sites between 725 ncRNAs and 2082 miRNAs were predicted. Using the co-location method, we predicted that a total of 235 lncRNAs target 1044 protein-coding genes, while the results of co-expression analysis revealed that 174 lncRNAs target 2097 mRNAs. Pathway enrichment analyses of the genes targeted by ncRNAs suggested that most ncRNAs were significantly enriched in immune or diseases-related pathways. NcRNA regulatory networks revealed that a single ncRNA could be directly or indirectly regulated by multiple genes or ncRNAs that could influence the immune response of cats. Co-expression analysis showed that 242 circRNAs, mainly involved in immune responses, were significantly associated with T. gondii infection. In contrast, 1352 protein coding RNAs, mainly involved in nucleic acid process/repair pathways or oocyte development pathways, were negatively associated with T. gondii infection. Conclusions: This study is the first to reveal the expression profiles of circRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNAs in the cat small intestine following T. gondii infection and will facilitate the elucidation of the role of ncRNAs in the pathogenesis of T. gondii infection in its definitive host, thereby facilitating the development of novel intervention strategies against T. gondii infection in humans and animals.

We identify the minimum noiseless sampling frequency and depth p required for a quantum device to outperform classical algorithms. There is potential for quantum advantage on hundreds of qubits and moderate depth with a sampling frequency of 10 kHz. We observe, however, that classical heuristic solvers are capable of producing high-quality approximate solutions in linear time complexity. In order to match this quality for large graph sizes N, a quantum device must support depth p > 11. Additionally, multi-shot QAOA is not efficient on large graphs, indicating that QAOA p ≤ 11 does not scale with N. These results limit achieving quantum advantage for QAOA MaxCut on 3-regular graphs. Other problems, such as different graphs, weighted MaxCut, and 3-SAT, may be better suited for achieving quantum advantage on near-term quantum devices. © 2023, UChicago Argonne, LLC, Operator of Argonne National Laboratory.","","Optimization; Quantum theory; Approximate optimization; Frequency threshold; Large graphs; Max-cut; Optimization algorithms; Performance; Quantum device; Regular graphs; Sampling frequencies; State of the art; Graphic methods","National Quantum Information Science Research Centers; U.S. Department of Defense, DOD; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; Office of Science, SC, (DE-AC02-06CH11357)","Funding text 1: This research was developed with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is used for the preventive treatment of pregnant women (IPTp), while SP plus amodiaquine (SP-AQ) is recommended for children under five in seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC). This study aimed to assess the proportions of mutations in the P. falciparum multidrug-resistance 1 (Pfmdr1), P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt), P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr), and P. falciparum dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps), genes from isolates collected during household surveys in Burkina Faso. Methods: Dried blood spots from Plasmodium falciparum-positive cases at three sites (Orodara, Gaoua, and Banfora) collected during the peak of transmission were analysed for mutations in Pfcrt (codons 72–76, 93, 97, 145, 218, 343, 350 and 353), Pfmdr-1 (codons 86, 184, 1034, 1042 and 1246) dhfr (codons 51, 59, 108, 164) and dhps (at codons 431, 436, 437, 540, 581, 613) genes using deep sequencing of multiplexed Polymerase chaine reaction (PCR) amplicons. Results: Of the 377 samples analysed, 346 (91.7%), 369 (97.9%), 368 (97.6%), and 374 (99.2%) were successfully sequenced for Pfcrt, Pfmdr-1, dhfr, and dhps, respectively. Most of the samples had a Pfcrt wild-type allele (89.3%). The 76T mutation was below 10%. The most frequent Pfmdr-1 mutation was detected at codon 184 (Y > F, 30.9%). The single mutant genotype (NFSND) predominated (66.7%), followed by the wild-type genotype (NYSND, 30.4%). The highest dhfr mutations were observed at codon 59R (69.8%), followed by codons 51I (66.6%) and 108 N (14.7%). The double mutant genotype (ACIRSI) predominated (52.4%). For mutation in the dhps gene, the highest frequency was observed at codon 437 K (89.3%), followed by codons 436 A (61.2%), and 613 S (14.4%). The double mutant genotype (IAKKAA) and the single mutant genotype (ISKKAA) were predominant (37.7% and 37.2%, respectively). The most frequent dhfr/dhps haplotypes were the triple mutant ACIRSI/IAKKAA (23%), the wild-type ACNCSI/ISKKAA (19%) and the double mutant ACIRSI/ISKKAA (14%). A septuple mutant ACIRNI/VAKKGA was observed in 2 isolates from Gaoua (0.5%). Conclusion: The efficacy of ACT partner drugs and drugs used in IPTp and SMC does not appear to be affected by the low proportion of highly resistant mutants observed in this study. Continued monitoring, including molecular surveillance, is critical for decision-making on effective treatment policy in Burkina Faso. © 2023, The Author(s).","ACT; Burkina Faso; Dhfr; Dhps; Malaria; Pfcrt; Pfmdr-1; Plasmodium falciparum; Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine","Antimalarials; Burkina Faso; Child; Codon; Drug Combinations; Drug Resistance; Female; Humans; Malaria; Malaria, Falciparum; Mutation; Plasmodium falciparum; Pregnancy; Pyrimethamine; Sulfadoxine; Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase; dihydrofolate reductase; dihydropteroate synthase; antimalarial agent; dihydrofolate reductase; pyrimethamine; sulfadoxine; allele; amplicon; antimalarial drug resistance; Article; Burkina Faso; child; codon; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease transmission; dried blood spot testing; endemic disease; female; gene; gene frequency; gene mutation; genetic association; genotype; haplotype; human; major clinical study; male; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; Pfcrt gene; pfdhfr gene; pfdhps gene; Pfmdr1 gene; Plasmodium falciparum; preschool child; sex difference; drug combination; drug resistance; genetics; malaria; malaria falciparum; mutation; Plasmodium falciparum; pregnancy","CNRFP; Institut Pasteur of Paris; Université de Strasbourg","This research received no external funding.

Multiple dark windows similar to electromagnetic induction transparency (EIT) are observed in quantum noise fluctuation curve. The effects of pumping light on both suppression of quantum noise and controlling the widths of dark windows are carefully analyzed, and the saturation point of the pumping light for nonlinear crystal conversion is obtained. We find that the noise suppression effect is very sensitive to the pumping light power. The degree of noise suppression can be up to 13.9 dB when the pumping light power is 0.65βth. Moreover, a phase-sensitive modulation scheme is demonstrated, which well fills the gap that multi-channel quantum noise suppression is difficult to realize at the quadrature amplitude of squeezed field.

For the simulation, the wavelength used is 1550 nm. This reversible logic gate optimizes the power requirement and have a non-dissipative operation. PWE and FDTD methods are used for the simulation process. The novelty of the proposed research work is that the implementation of the Fredkin gate is organized only by the constructive/destructive interferences of the light.

The AdaBoost algorithm is a well-known classical boosting algorithm for weak learners with binary hypotheses. Recently, Arunachalam and Maity presented the first quantum boosting algorithm by quantizing AdaBoost. Their algorithm, which we refer to as QAdaBoost hereafter, is a quantum adaptation of AdaBoost and only works for the binary hypothesis case. QAdaBoost is quadratically faster than AdaBoost in terms of the VC dimension of the hypothesis class of the weak learner. However, QAdaBoost is polynomially worse in the bias of the weak learner. In this work, we address an open question by Izdebski et al. on the existence of boosting algorithms for quantum weak learners with non-binary hypotheses. We answer this question in the affirmative by developing the QRealBoost algorithm motivated by the classical RealBoost algorithm. The main technical challenge was to provide provable guarantees for convergence, generalization bounds, and quantum speedup, given that quantum subroutines are noisy and probabilistic. We prove that QRealBoost retains the quadratic speedup of QAdaBoost over AdaBoost and further achieves a polynomial speedup over QAdaBoost in terms of both the bias of the learner and the time taken by the learner to learn the target concept class. Finally, we perform empirical evaluations on QRealBoost and report encouraging observations on quantum simulators by benchmarking the convergence performance of QRealBoost against QAdaBoost, AdaBoost, RealBoost, and SmoothBoost on a subset of the MNIST dataset and Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Boosting; Quantum computing","Benchmarking; Learning systems; Quantum computers; Binary hypothesis; Boosting; Boosting algorithm; Domain partitioning; Ensemble learning; Learning frameworks; Learning methods; PAC learning; Quantum Computing; Weak learner; Adaptive boosting","","","S.

As quantum chips scale up, the number of Josephson junctions on sapphire increases. Thus, both the uniformity and stability of the junctions are crucial to quantum devices, such as scalable superconducting quantum computer circuit, and quantum-limited amplifiers. By optimizing the fabrication process, especially, the conductive layer during the electron beam lithography process, Al/AlOx/Al junctions of sizes ranging from 0.0169 to 0.04 µm2 on sapphire substrates were prepared. The relative standard deviation of room temperature resistances (R N) – σRN/〈RN〉 of these junctions is better than 1.7% on 15 mm × 15 mm chips, and better than 2.66% on 2 inch wafers, which is the highest uniformity on sapphire substrates has been reported. The junctions are robust and stable in resistances as temperature changes. The resistances increase by the ratio of 9.73% relative to R N as the temperature ramp down to 4 K, and restore their initial values in the reverse process as the temperature ramps back to room temperature. After being stored in a nitrogen cabinet for 100 days, the resistance of the junctions changed by1.16% on average. The demonstration of uniform and stable Josephson junctions in large area paves the way for the fabrication of superconducting chip of hundreds of qubits on sapphire substrates. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","Start-up foundation of Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (Y9AAD110); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, YIPA CAS, (2019319)","K.

Nonetheless, when such a fermionic system is in a pure state, it is subject to additional restrictions known as the generalized Pauli constraints (GPCs). Here we verify experimentally the violation of the GPCs for an open quantum system using data from a superconducting-qubit quantum computer. We prepare states of systems with three-to-seven qubits directly on the quantum device and measure the one-fermion reduced density matrix (1-RDM) from which we can test the GPCs. We find that the GPCs of the 1-RDM are sufficiently sensitive to detect the openness of the 3-to-7 qubit systems in the presence of a single-qubit environment. Results confirm experimentally that the openness of a many-fermion quantum system can be decoded from only a knowledge of the 1-RDM with potential applications from quantum computing and sensing to noise-assisted energy transfer. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Quantum optics; Qubits; Fermionic systems; Fundamental structures; Open quantum systems; Pauli exclusion principle; Pure state; Quanta computers; Quantum device; Reduced-density matrix; State of system; Superconducting qubits; Energy transfer","NSF QuBBE Quantum Leap Challenge Institute; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CHE-2035876, CHE-2155082, OMA-2121044); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Basic Energy Sciences, BES, (DE-SC0019215, DGE-1746045)","Funding text 1: D.A.M. gratefully acknowledges NSF QuBBE Quantum Leap Challenge Institute (NSF OMA-2121044), the U.S. National Science Foundation Grants No. CHE-2155082 and CHE-2035876, and the Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Grant DE-SC0019215.

Here, we introduce a mechanism stabilizing a one-dimensional quantum many-body phase exploiting an emergent Z2 -symmetry based on a simple geometrical modification, i.e. a site that couples to all lattice sites. We illustrate this mechanism by constructing the solution of the full quantum many-body problem of hardcore bosons on a wheel geometry, which are known to form Bose-Einstein condensates. The robustness of the condensate against interactions is shown numerically by adding nearest-neighbor interactions, which typically destroy Bose-Einstein condensates. We discuss further applications such as geometrically inducing finite-momentum condensates. Since our solution strategy is based on a generic mapping, our findings are applicable in a broader context, in which a particular state should be protected, by introducing an additional center site. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Statistical mechanics; Bose-Einstein condensates; Bose-Einstein-condensation; External perturbations; External temperature; Geometrical modification; Hard-core bosons; Many body; One-dimensional; Quantum state; Simple++; Bose-Einstein condensation","Paderborn Center for Parallel Computing; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (758935); European Research Council, ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (277974659); Munich Center for Quantum Science and Technology, MCQST","Funding text 1: We thank F.

BA.5 has become the dominant strain worldwide. Additionally, BA.2.75 is significantly increasing in some countries. Exploring their receptor binding and interspecies transmission risk is urgently needed. Herein, we examine the binding capacities of human and other 28 animal ACE2 orthologs covering nine orders towards S proteins of these sub-variants. The binding affinities between hACE2 and these sub-variants remain in the range as that of previous variants of concerns (VOCs) or interests (VOIs). Notably, R493Q reverse mutation enhances the bindings towards ACE2s from humans and many animals closely related to human life, suggesting an increased risk of cross-species transmission. Structures of S/hACE2 or RBD/hACE2 complexes for these sub-variants and BA.2 S binding to ACE2 of mouse, rat or golden hamster are determined to reveal the molecular basis for receptor binding and broader interspecies recognition. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; Animals; COVID-19; Cricetinae; Humans; Mesocricetus; Mice; Mutation; Rats; SARS-CoV-2; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; chemical binding; disease transmission; mutation; protein; severe acute respiratory syndrome; animal experiment; animal model; article; binding affinity; controlled study; genetic susceptibility; human; male; molecular recognition; mouse; nonhuman; orthology; rat; receptor binding; revertant; Syrian hamster; zoonotic transmission; animal; coronavirus disease 2019; genetics; hamster; Mesocricetus; mutation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","Cryo-EM Center; PMI-IMCAS Public Technology Service Center; Shanxi Academy of Advanced Research and Innovation; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (92169208); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XD29010202); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2022T150688); China National Tobacco Corporation, CNTC, (110202102034); China Academy of Space Technology, CAST, (2021QNRC001); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFC2301401, 2023YFC3041500)","Funding text 1: We are grateful to the PMI-IMCAS Public Technology Service Center for its support on the FACS assay.

We present a version based on single particle discrete-time quantum walk to realize multi-qubit computation tasks. The scalability of the scheme is demonstrated by using a set of walk operations on a closed lattice form to implement the universal set of quantum gates on multi-qubit system. We also present a set of experimentally realizable walk operations that can implement Grover’s algorithm, quantum Fourier transformation and quantum phase estimation algorithms. An elementary implementation of error detection and correction is also presented. Analysis of space and time complexity of the scheme highlights the advantages of quantum walk based model for quantum computation on systems where implementation of quantum walk evolution operations is an inherent feature of the system. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems, (DST/ICPS/QuST/Theme-1/2019/1); Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी, (SB/S2/RJN-192/2014)","CMC would like to thank Department of Science and Technology, Government of India for the Ramanujan Fellowship Grant No.: SB/S2/RJN-192/2014.

Traditional QSM protocols require multi-partite entanglement, which limits its near-term implementation due to technological constraints. This paper proposes a QSM scheme that employs Bell pairs to provide unconditional security while offering precision scaling beyond the standard quantum limit. We provide a detailed comparative performance analysis of our proposal under multiple attacks. We found that the employed controlled encoding strategy is far better than the parallel encoding of multi-partite entangled states with regard to the secrecy of the parameter. We also identify and characterize an intrinsic trade-off relationship between the maximum achievable precision and security under the limited availability of resources. The dynamic scalability of the proposed protocol makes it suitable for large-scale network sensing scenarios. © 2023, The Author(s).","","article; security","Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (IITP-2023-2021-0-02046); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2019R1A2C2007037, NRF-2022R1A4A3033401)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (NRF-2019R1A2C2007037, NRF-2022R1A4A3033401) and by the MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program (IITP-2023-2021-0-02046) supervised by the IITP (Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation).

However, current approaches with qubits suffer from limited connectivity. We propose an implementation for quantum reservoir that obtains a large number of densely connected neurons by using parametrically coupled quantum oscillators instead of physically coupled qubits. We analyze a specific hardware implementation based on superconducting circuits: with just two coupled quantum oscillators, we create a quantum reservoir comprising up to 81 neurons. We obtain state-of-the-art accuracy of 99% on benchmark tasks that otherwise require at least 24 classical oscillators to be solved. Our results give the coupling and dissipation requirements in the system and show how they affect the performance of the quantum reservoir. Beyond quantum reservoir computing, the use of parametrically coupled bosonic modes holds promise for realizing large quantum neural network architectures, with billions of neurons implemented with only 10 coupled quantum oscillators. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Network architecture; Neural networks; Oscillators (electronic); Qubits; 'current; Coupled qubits; Hardware implementations; Input datas; Learning tasks; Quantum neural networks; Quantum oscillators; Reservoir Computing; Specific hardware; Superconducting circuit; Neurons","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Basic Energy Sciences, BES, (DE-SC0019273); European Commission, EC; European Research Council, ERC, (101076898)","This research was supported by the Quantum Materials for Energy Efficient Neuromorphic Computing (Q-MEEN-C), an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES), under Award DE-SC0019273, by the Paris Ȋle-de-France Region in the framework of DIM SIRTEQ and by European Union (ERC, qDynnet, 101076898).

While electronic wave functions can be represented using a product of fermionic unitary operators, the best ansatz for strongly correlated electronic systems is far from clear. In this contribution, we construct universal wave functions from gate-efficient, spin symmetry-preserving fermionic operators by introducing an algorithm that globally optimises the wave function in the discrete ansatz design and continuous parameter spaces. Our approach maximises the accuracy that can be obtained with near-term quantum circuits and provides a practical route for designing ansätze in the future. Numerical simulations for strongly correlated molecules, including water and molecular nitrogen, and the condensed-matter Hubbard model, demonstrate the improved accuracy of gate-efficient quantum circuits for simulating strongly correlated chemistry. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Global optimization; Quantum computers; Quantum efficiency; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Correlated electronic systems; Electronic simulation; Electronic wave functions; Exponentials; Global optimisation; Quanta computers; Quantum circuit; Scalings; Spin symmetry; Unitary operators; Wave functions","EPSRC Hub in Quantum Computing and Simulation, (EP/T001062/1); New College, Oxford; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC","The authors gratefully acknowledge the use of the University of Oxford Advanced Research Computing (ARC) facility in carrying out this work. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22558 H.G.A.B. was supported by New College, Oxford through the Astor Junior Research Fellowship.

The formulas of average von Neumann entropy with and without particle number constraints have been recently obtained, whereas the main results of this work are the exact yet explicit formulas of variances for both cases. For the latter case of no particle number constraint, the results resolve a recent conjecture on the corresponding variance. Different than the existing methods in computing variances over other generic state models, proving the results of this work relies on a new simplification framework. The framework consists of a set of new tools in simplifying finite summations of what we refer to as dummy summation and re-summation techniques.

In the quasi-ballistic regime of our high-mobility sample, we report conductance quantization steps in units of e2/h for a wide range of carrier concentrations. Magnetic field measurements show that as the field is raised, higher conductance plateaus move to accurate quantized values and then shift to lower conductance values while the e2/h plateau remains locked. Based on microscopic atomistic tight-binding theory, we show that in this material, valley and spin degeneracies result in 2 e2/h conductance steps for noninteracting holes, suggesting that symmetry-breaking mechanisms such as valley polarization dominate the transport properties of such quantum structures. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Carrier concentration; Carrier mobility; Monolayers; Transition metals; Ballistic regime; Conductance quantization; High mobility; Magnetic fields measurements; Many-body interactions; One-dimensional channels; Quantum device; Quasi-ballistic; Single layer; Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD); Quantum chemistry","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN- 2019-05714, STPG-521420); National Research Council Canada, NRC; Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (2021/43/D/ST3/01989); Narodowa Agencja Wymiany Akademickiej, NAWA, (PPI/APM/2019/1/00085/U/00001); Alliance de recherche numérique du Canada, l’Alliance","We would like to thank Dr. Andrew Sachrajda for the fruitful discussions.

Nees (R. procumbens) extract and to make a preliminary investigation of its anti-nephritis mechanism. Methods: A prediction network was built that describes the relationship between R. procumbens and CGN. Then, the potential targets for R. procumbens against CGN were imported into the DAVID database for Gene Ontology (GO) biological annotation analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated rat mesangial cell HBZY-1 model in vitro was used to examine the anti-inflammatory activity of R. procumbens extract. RNA-seq was utilized to investigate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched signaling pathways between groups. Finally, qPCR was used for the validation analysis of the experimental results. Results: The results of network pharmacology showed that R. procumbens exerts its therapeutic effect on CGN through the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, PI3K-Akt, IL-17 signaling pathway, and so on. R. procumbens n-butanol extract (J-NE) can effectively relieve inflammation in HBZY-1. The results of KEGG pathway enrichment suggest that J-NE attenuated CGN was associated with the IL-17 signaling pathway, and the results of RNA-seq were consistent with network pharmacology. Targets enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway, including Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7 (CCL7), Lipocalin 2 (LCN2), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), and Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), have been identified as crucial targets attenuating CGN by J-NE. Conclusion: R. procumbens is a promising pharmacological candidate for the treatment of CGN in the present era. © 2023, The Author(s).","Chronic glomerulonephritis; Mechanism; Network pharmacology; RNA-seq; Rostellularia procumbens (L.)

In particular, those based on colour centres in diamond have demonstrated high sensitivity to magnetic field through exploiting the field-dependent emission of fluorescence under coherent control using microwaves. Given the highly biocompatible nature of diamond, sensing from biological samples is a key interdisciplinary application. In particular, the microscopic-scale study of living systems can be possible through recording of temperature and biomagnetic field. In this work, we use such a quantum sensor to demonstrate such microscopic-scale recording of electrical activity from neurons in fragile living brain tissue. By recording weak magnetic field induced by ionic currents in mouse corpus callosum axons, we accurately recover signals from neuronal action potential propagation while demonstrating in situ pharmacology. Our sensor allows recording of the electrical activity in neural circuits, disruption of which can shed light on the mechanisms of disease emergence. Unlike existing techniques for recording activity, which can require potentially damaging direct interaction, our sensing is entirely passive and remote from the sample. Our results open a promising new avenue for the microscopic recording of neuronal signals, offering the eventual prospect of microscopic imaging of electrical activity in the living mammalian brain. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Animals; Brain; Diamond; Fluorescence; Magnetic Fields; Mammals; Mice; Neurons; diamond; animal; brain; fluorescence; magnetic field; mammal; mouse; nerve cell; physiology","European Research Council, ERC, (SyG 856432); Danmarks Grundforskningsfond, DNRF, (DNRF142); Lundbeck Foundation, (R186); Det Sundhedsvidenskabelige Fakultet, Københavns Universitet, SUND, KU; Novo Nordisk Fonden, NNF, (NNF17OC0028086, NNF21OC0066526); Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond, DFF, (0135-00142B, NNF20OC0061673)","This work was funded by the Novo Nordisk foundation through the synergy grant bioQ (Grant Number: NNF17OC0028086), the NNF Challenge Grant BIO-MAG (NNF21OC0066526) and the Center for Macroscale Quantum States (bigQ) funded by the Danish National Research Foundation (Grant number:DNRF142).

In this paper, we study abundant density structures and corresponding dynamics of phase-separated binary Bose–Einstein condensates with phase-imprinted single vortex or vortex dipole. By adjusting the ratio between the inter-species and intra-species interactions, and the locations of the phase singularities, the typical density profiles such as ball-shell structures, crescent-gibbous structures, Matryoshka-like structures, sector-sector structures and sandwich-type structures appear, and the phase diagrams are obtained. The dynamics of these structures exhibit diverse properties, including the penetration of vortex dipoles, emergence of halfvortex dipoles, co-rotation of sectors, and oscillation between sectors. The pinning effects induced by a potential defect are also discussed, which is useful for controlling and manipulating individual quantum states.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2023, Higher Education Press.","angular momentum; Bose–Einstein condensates; energy competition; phase separation","","Natural Science of Shaanxi Province, (2017KCT-12, 2017ZDJC-32); Shaanxi Fundamental Science Research Project for Mathematics and Physics, (22JSQ041, 22JSZ005); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11934015, 12175180, 12247103, 12247186); Northwest University, NWU; Education Department of Shaanxi Province, (22JK0581); Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province, (2023-JC-QN-0054)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant Nos. 12175180, 11934015, 12247103, and 12247186, the Major Basic Research Program of Natural Science of Shaanxi Province under grant Nos. 2017KCT-12 and 2017ZDJC-32, the Scientific Research Program Funded by Education Department of Shaanxi Provincial Government under grant No. 22JK0581, the Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi under grant No. 2023-JC-QN-0054, and Shaanxi Fundamental Science Research Project for Mathematics and Physics under grant Nos. 22JSZ005 and 22JSQ041.

Although several pathogens have been isolated and extensively studied, the complete infectome of the respiratory complex consists of a more extensive range unrecognised species. Here, we used total RNA sequencing (i.e., metatranscriptomics) of nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs collected from animals with and without BRD from two cattle feedlots in Australia. Results: A high abundance of bovine nidovirus, influenza D, bovine rhinitis A and bovine coronavirus was found in the samples. Additionally, we obtained the complete or near-complete genome of bovine rhinitis B, enterovirus E1, bovine viral diarrhea virus (sub-genotypes 1a and 1c) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus, and partial sequences of other viruses. A new species of paramyxovirus was also identified. Overall, the most abundant RNA virus, was the bovine nidovirus. Characterisation of bacterial species from the transcriptome revealed a high abundance and diversity of Mollicutes in BRD cases and unaffected control animals. Of the non-Mollicutes species, Histophilus somni was detected, whereas there was a low abundance of Mannheimia haemolytica. Conclusion: This study highlights the use of untargeted sequencing approaches to study the unrecognised range of microorganisms present in healthy or diseased animals and the need to study previously uncultured viral species that may have an important role in cattle respiratory disease.

Fusing data from multiple modalities can enhance accuracy but requires substantial computing power. Theoretically, quantum computers can rapidly process large volumes of high-dimensional medical data. Despite accelerated developments in quantum computing, research on quantum machine learning (QML) for multimodal data processing remains limited. Considering these factors, this paper presents a quantum neural network-based multimodal fusion system for intelligent diagnosis (QNMF) that can process multimodal medical data transmitted by IoMT devices, fuse data from different modalities, and improve the performance of intelligent diagnosis. This system employs a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) to efficiently extract features from medical images. These QCNN-based features are then fused with other modality features (such as blood test results or breast cell slices), and used to train an effective variational quantum classifier (VQC) for intelligent diagnosis. The experimental results demonstrate that a QCNN can effectively extract image data features. Furthermore, QNMF achieved an accuracy of 97.07% and 97.61% on breast cancer diagnosis and Covid-19 diagnosis experiments, respectively. In addition, the QNMF exhibits strong quantum noise robustness. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Internet of medical things; Multimodal fusion; Quantum neural network; Smart healthcare","Big data; Data handling; Data mining; Diagnosis; Electric power transmission; Medical imaging; Quantum noise; Convolutional neural network; Fusion systems; Intelligent diagnosis; Internet of medical thing; Medical data; Multi-modal fusion; Network-based; Quantum neural networks; Research areas; Smart healthcare; Convolutional neural networks","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61373131, 62071240); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, PAPD","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61373131 , 62071240 ), PAPD and CICAEET funds.","P.

However, the lengthy longitudinal relaxation of the nuclear spins significantly extends the total experimental time, especially at high and ultra-high magnetic field strengths. Although longitudinal relaxation-enhanced techniques have sped up data acquisition, their application has been limited by the chemical shift dispersion. Here we combined an evolutionary algorithm and artificial intelligence to design 1H and 15N radio frequency (RF) pulses with variable phase and amplitude that cover significantly broader bandwidths and allow for rapid data acquisition. We re-engineered the basic transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy experiment and showed that the RF shapes enhance the spectral sensitivity of well-folded proteins up to 180 kDa molecular weight.

The model employs qubit entanglement to simulate interactions between genes, resulting in competitive performance and promising potential for further exploration. We applied our quantum GRN modeling approach to single-cell transcriptomic data from human lymphoblastoid cells, focusing on a small set of genes involved in innate immunity regulation. Our quantum circuit model successfully predicted the presence and absence of regulatory interactions between genes, while also estimating the strength of these interactions. We argue that the application of quantum computing in biology has the potential to provide a better understanding of single-cell GRNs by more effectively approaching the relationship between fully interconnected genes compared to conventional statistical methods such as correlation and regression.

This work reports a chemical reaction with extreme rotational excitation of a reactant and its kinetic characterization. We investigate the chemical reactivity for the hydrogen abstraction reaction SiO+ + H2 → SiOH+ + H in an ion trap. The SiO+ cations are prepared in a narrow rotational state distribution, including super-rotor states with rotational quantum number (j) as high as 170, using a broad-band optical pumping method. We show that the super-rotor states of SiO+ substantially enhance the reaction rate, a trend reproduced by complementary theoretical studies. We reveal the mechanism for the rotational enhancement of the reactivity to be a strong coupling of the SiO+ rotational mode with the reaction coordinate at the transition state on the dominant dynamical pathway. © 2023, The Author(s).","","cation; hydrogen; cation; chemical reaction; hydrogen; pumping; Article; chemical reaction; conformational transition; cross coupling reaction; excitation; kinetics; reaction analysis; theoretical study","National Science Foundation, NSF, (PHY-1806861); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-17-1-0352); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (22073073); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, (2021JM-311, FA9550-22-1-0350)","Development of dissociative analysis techniques were funded by NSF Grant No. PHY-1806861, and super rotor pumping techniques and chemistry analysis were supported by AFOSR Grant No. FA9550-17-1-0352.

Here, we achieve a breakthrough based on a configurable circular-polarization-dependent optoelectronic silent state created by the superposition of two photoresponses with enantiomerically opposite ellipticity dependences. The zero photocurrent and the significantly suppressed noise of the optoelectronic silent state singularly enhance the circular polarization extinction ratio (CPER) and the sensitivity to light ellipticity perturbation. The CPER of our device approaches infinity by the traditional definition. The newly established CPER taking noise into account is 3–4 orders of magnitude higher than those of ordinary integrated circular polarization detectors, and it remains high in an expanded wavelength range. The noise equivalent light ellipticity difference goes below 0.009° Hz−1/2 at modulation frequencies above 1000 Hz by a light power of 281 μW. This scheme brings a leap in developing monolithic ultracompact circular polarization detectors. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Filter-less; Light ellipticity; Light power; Modulation frequencies; Monolithics; Orders of magnitude; Photoresponses; Polarization extinction ratio; Suppressed noise; Wavelength ranges; Circular polarization","Key Deployment Projects of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, (ZDRW-XH-2021-7-1); ShanghaiTech University Quantum Device Lab; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12174036, 61975223, 61991442, 91850208); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (20181214); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (2019SHZDZX01); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFA0306200, 2022YFA1404602); Program of Shanghai Academic Research Leader, (22XD1424400)","The authors acknowledge the support of the ShanghaiTech University Quantum Device Lab (SQDL), and the support of Zheng Fan and Zhaoxin Zhu from SQDL on fabrication.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)—intrinsically porous crystals—with π-conjugated triphenylene-based ligands show high electrical conductivities. Forming nanosheets of such conductive MOFs should enable their use in electronic devices. Although highly conductive MOF nanosheets have been created at the air/liquid interface, direct control of their continuity, morphology, thickness, crystallinity, and orientation directly influencing device performance remains as an issue to be addressed. Here, we present detailed insights into the formation process of electrically conductive MOF nanosheets composed of 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene (HITP) and Ni2+ ions (HITP-Ni-NS) at the air/liquid interface. The morphological and structural features of HITP-Ni-NS strongly depend on the standing time—the time without any external actions involved, but leaving the interface undisturbed after setting the ligand solution onto the metal-ion solution. We find that the fundamental features of HITP-Ni-NS are determined by the standing time with conductivity sensitively influenced by such pre-determined HITP-Ni-NS characteristics. These findings will lead towards the establishment of a rational strategy for creating MOF nanosheets at the air/liquid interface with desired properties, thereby accelerating their use in diverse potential applications. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Air/liquid interfaces; Electrically conductive; Langmuir–Blodgett films; Metal–organic frameworks; Nanosheets; Oriented bottom-up growth","Conductive films; Crystallinity; Langmuir Blodgett films; Ligands; Metal ions; Phase interfaces; ligand; metal organic framework; nanosheet; water; Air liquid interfaces; Bottom up; Electrically conductive; Formation process; High electrical conductivity; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Oriented bottom-up growth; Porous crystals; Triphenylenes; Two-dimensional growth; absorption; absorption spectroscopy; air; aqueous solution; Article; compression; conductance; controlled study; crystal; crystal structure; deprotonation; electric conductivity; evaporation; Fourier transform; liquid; qualitative analysis; stoichiometry; surface area; surface property; thickness; time; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; Nanosheets","Masuya Kinen Kenkyu Shinko foundation, (22NR0036, NPS17064); Mazda Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP16H05968, JP16K13610, JP19H05715, JP20H02551, JP21J13884); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP19H05715 (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Area: Aquatic Functional Materials), JP16H05968, JP16K13610, JP20H02551, and JP21J13884 (Research Fellowship for Young Scientists), the Mazda foundation and the Masuya Kinen Kenkyu Shinko foundation, Japan.

For short interatomic separations and limited signal-to-noise ratio, this task becomes increasingly challenging. Common methods rapidly decline in performance as the lattice spacing is decreased below half the imaging resolution. Here, we present an algorithm based on deep convolutional neural networks to reconstruct the site-resolved lattice occupation with high fidelity. The algorithm can be directly trained in an unsupervised fashion with experimental fluorescence images and allows for a fast reconstruction of large images containing several thousand lattice sites. We benchmark its performance using a quantum gas microscope with cesium atoms that utilizes short-spaced optical lattices with lattice constant 383.5 nm and a typical Rayleigh resolution of 850 nm. We obtain promising reconstruction fidelities ≳ 96% across all fillings based on a statistical analysis. We anticipate this algorithm to enable novel experiments with shorter lattice spacing, boost the readout fidelity and speed of lower-resolution imaging systems, and furthermore find application in related experiments such as trapped ions. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Benchmarking; Deep neural networks; Gases; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Learning algorithms; Signal to noise ratio; Trapped ions; Convolutional neural network; Fast reconstruction; Fluorescence image; High-fidelity; Imaging resolutions; Interatomic separation; Lattice spacing; Performance; Quantum gas; Single sites; Optical lattices","Bavarian excellence network ENB; German Academic Scholarship Foundation; Marianne-Plehn-Program; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (897142); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (277974659, EXC-2111 - 390814868); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (13N15895 FermiQP); Hector Fellow Academy; Munich Center for Quantum Science and Technology, MCQST, (390814868, EXC-2111)","The authors would like to thank Christian Schweizer for their contributions to the early stages of this experiment and Annabelle Bohrdt for helpful discussions on machine learning architectures.

To this end we realize the quantum version of the linear-zigzag structural transition for arrays of up to five ground state-cooled ions held in a linear Paul trap and we demonstrate several of the control requirements towards entangled-state interferometry near the critical point. Using in situ spectroscopy we probe the energy level structure and occupation of the soft mode associated with the structural transition, and show a stable critical point and majority ground state occupation crossing the transition. We resolve biases arising from trap electrode asymmetries that change the nature of the transition, show that they can be suppressed by varying the ion number, and demonstrate control of the transition bias using optical dipole forces. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Phase transitions; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Trapped ions; Control requirements; Entangled state; Linear Paul Trap; Physical systems; Quantum state; Quantum system; Quantum-phase transition; Spectroscopic characterization; Structural transitions; Trapped ion; Ground state","Canada Foundation for Innovation Leaders Opportunity Fund; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12004430); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2023JJ10052); Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province, (2022RC1194)","We thank Haggai Landa for helpful discussions.

An important property of some open quantum systems is the existence of decoherence-free subspaces. A quantum state from a decoherence-free subspace will evolve unitarily. However, there is no procedural and optimal method for constructing a decoherence-free subspace. In this paper, we develop tools for constructing decoherence-free stabilizer codes for open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. This is done by pursuing an extension of the stabilizer formalism beyond the celebrated group structure of Pauli error operators. We then show how to utilize decoherence-free stabilizer codes in quantum metrology in order to attain the Heisenberg limit scaling with low computational complexity. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Excipients; Records; excipient; information processing","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (862644)","The authors acknowledge the funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, under grant agreement QUARTET No 862644.

However, the widely used servo has only one or two channels, and its massive use makes the control system complicated and difficult to manage. To address this issue, we develop, manufacture and characterize a compact eight-channel digital servo with a control bandwidth of over 1 MHz which is embedded on a single FPGA. To show the performance of our homemade digital servo, we demonstrate three typical laser-related active stabilizations in the AMO experiments. An external cavity diode laser (ECDL) is frequency locked to an ultra-stable optical reference cavity, resulting in a linewidth of 65 kHz. Suppression of the intensity noise of laser light over 150 kHz is achieved by using an acoustic-optic modulator. An actively stabilized Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a nine meters long air arm shows an optical path fluctuation of less than 6 nm. Due to its versatile applicability and excellent scalability, we believe that this configuration will be widely used in AMO, especially in optics and laser-related experiments. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Atomic, molecular and optical physics; Digital PID controller; Interferometer locking; Laser frequency stabilization; Laser intensity noise suppression; PDH","Atomic physics; Frequency stability; Interferometers; Locks (fasteners); Stabilization; Active stabilization; Atomic, molecular and optical physic; Digital PID controllers; Intensity-noise suppression; Interferometer locking; Laser frequency stabilization; Laser intensity noise; Laser intensity noise suppression; Optical physics; PDH; Three term control systems","Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0301200); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11804330, 11821404); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (WK2470000038)","This work was supported by the Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology (Grant No. 2021ZD0301200 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 11804330 and 11821404 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( WK2470000038 ).","J.

Recently, QEs in two-dimensional semiconductors have attracted great interest as promising quantum light sources. However, whether those QEs are characterized by the same valley physics as delocalized valley excitons is still under debate. Moreover, the potential applications of such QEs still need to be explored. Here we show experimental evidence of valley symmetry breaking for neutral QEs in WSe2 monolayer by interacting with chiral plasmonic nanocavities. The anomalous magneto-optical behaviour of the coupled QEs suggests that the polarization state of emitted photon is modulated by the chiral nanocavity instead of the valley-dependent optical selection rules. Calculations of cavity quantum electrodynamics further show the absence of intrinsic valley polarization. The cavity-dependent circularly polarized single-photon output also offers a strategy for future applications in chiral quantum optics. © 2023, The Author(s).","","angular momentum; electrodynamics; physics; polarization; quantum mechanics; symmetry; valley; article; calculation; chirality; photon; polarization; quantum optics","Strategic Priority Research Program, (XDB28000000); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11721404, 11934019, 12174437, 12204020, 62025507, 62175254, 92250301); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2022M710234); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFA1400700)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2021YFA1400700), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants Nos. 62025507, 11934019, 92250301, 11721404, 62175254, 12174437, and 12204020), the Strategic Priority Research Program (Grant No. XDB28000000) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2022M710234).

In this scenario, it is important to reduce the amount of quantum communication between the client and the server. A possible approach is to transform the desired computation into a compressed version that acts on a smaller number of qubits, thereby reducing the amount of data exchanged between the client and the server. Here we propose quantum autoencoders for quantum gates (QAEGate) as a method for compressing quantum computations. We illustrate it in concrete scenarios of single-round and multi-round communication and validate it through numerical experiments. A bonus of our method is it does not reveal any information about the server’s computation other than the information present in the output. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Quantum autoencoders; Quantum cloud computing; Quantum gate","Electronic data interchange; Learning systems; Logic gates; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Auto encoders; Cloud-computing; Numerical experiments; Quantum autoencoder; Quantum cloud computing; Quantum data; Quantum gates; Cloud computing","The Quantum Information Structure of Spacetime; John Templeton Foundation, JTF, (62312); Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, ISED; Government of Canada; Croucher Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61872318); Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (17300918, 17307520, SRFS2021-7S02); Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science, MRIS","This work was supported by funding from the Hong Kong Research Grant Council through grants no. 17300918 and no. 17307520, through the Senior Research Fellowship Scheme SRFS2021-7S02, the Croucher Foundation, and by the John Templeton Foundation through grant 62312, The Quantum Information Structure of Spacetime (qiss.fr).

In this work, we investigate the practical advantage of quantum machine learning in ghost imaging by overcoming the limitations of classical methods in blind object identification and imaging. We propose two hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithms and a physical-inspired patch strategy to allow distributed quantum learning with parallel variational circuits. In light of the algorithm, we conduct experiments for imaging-free object identification and blind ghost imaging under different physical sampling rates. We further quantitatively analyze the advantage through the lens of information geometry and generalization capability. The numerical results showcase that quantum machine learning can restore high-quality images but classical machine learning fails. The advantage of identification rate are up to 10% via fair comparison with the classical machine learning methods.

By periodically modulating the resonant frequencies of qubits, we engineer a synthetic gauge field to mimic the generalized Hofstadter Hamiltonian. A spectroscopic method is used to demonstrate the Hofstadter butterfly from the time evolutions of experimental observables. We numerically simulate the dynamics of the system with realistic parameters, and the results show a butterfly spectrum clearly.

While quantum batteries has been investigated largely theoretical, recent research indicates that it may be possible to implement such a device using existing technologies. The environment plays an important role in the charging of quantum batteries. If a strong coupling exists between the environment and the battery, then battery can be charged properly. It has also been demonstrated that quantum battery can be charged even in weak coupling regime just by choosing a suitable initial state for battery and charger. In this study, we investigate the charging process of open quantum batteries mediated by a common dissipative environment. We will consider a wireless-like charging scenario, where there is no external power and direct interaction between charger and battery. Moreover, we consider the case in which the battery and charger move inside the environment with a particular speed. Our results demonstrate that the movement of the quantum battery inside the environment has a negative effect on the performance of the quantum batteries during the charging process. It is also shown that the non-Markovian environment has a positive effect on improving battery performance. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Electric Power Supplies; Movement; Physics; Technology; article; velocity; movement (physiology); physics; power supply; technology","","","S.

In this study, we propose a quantum mechanical model of adaptive mutation based on the implications of the theory of open quantum systems. We survey a new framework that explain how random point mutations can be stabilized and directed to be adapted with the stresses introduced by the environments according to the microscopic rules dictated by constraints of quantum mechanics. We consider a pair of entangled qubits consist of DNA and mRNA pair, each coupled to a distinct reservoir for analyzing the spreed of entanglement using time-dependent perturbation theory. The reservoirs are physical demonstrations of the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm and surrounding environments of mRNA and DNA, respectively. Our predictions confirm the role of the environmental-assisted quantum progression of adaptive mutations. Computing the concurrence as a measure that determines to what extent the bipartite DNA-mRNA can be correlated through entanglement, is given. Preventing the entanglement loss is crucial for controlling unfavorable point mutations under environmental influences. We explore which physical parameters may affect the preservation of entanglement between DNA and mRNA pair systems, despite the destructive role of interaction with the environments. © 2023, The Author(s).","","DNA; Mutation; Point Mutation; RNA; RNA, Messenger; DNA; messenger RNA; RNA; genetics; mutation; point mutation","","","F.

Routing problem variants considered include graph type, directionally varying weights, number of parties involved in routing, among others. We put emphasis on the explanation of how to convert such problems into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. QUBO is one of two equivalent natural paradigms for quantum annealing devices, the other being the Ising Model. We also expand upon a previously discovered algorithm for solving the Chinese Postman Problem on a closed undirected graph to decrease the number of constraints and variables used in the problem. Optimal annealing parameter settings and constraint weight values are discussed based on results from implementation on the D-Wave 2000Q and Advantage.

These algorithms are based on Fourier transforms and share their time-complexity. This limits highly-resolved measurement data to be processed at high speeds which would be advantageous for modern production feed lines. In this publication, we present the development and implementation of the RMA on a quantum computer that scales favourably compared to the time complexity of the classical RMA. We compare reconstruction results of simulated and measured data of the classical and quantum RMA. Hereby, the quantum RMA is run on a quantum simulator backend as well as on IBM’s Q System One quantum computer.

Einstein’s theory of space and time allows for spacetime singularities and Van Hove singularities arise in condensed matter physics, while intensity, phase and polarization singularities pervade wave physics. Within dissipative systems governed by matrices, singularities occur at the exceptional points in parameter space whereby some eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce simultaneously. However, the nature of exceptional points arising in quantum systems described within an open quantum systems approach has been much less studied. Here we consider a quantum oscillator driven parametrically and subject to loss. This squeezed system exhibits an exceptional point in the dynamical equations describing its first and second moments, which acts as a borderland between two phases with distinctive physical consequences. In particular, we discuss how the populations, correlations, squeezed quadratures and optical spectra crucially depend on being above or below the exceptional point. We also remark upon the presence of a dissipative phase transition at a critical point, which is associated with the closing of the Liouvillian gap. Our results invite the experimental probing of quantum resonators under two-photon driving, and perhaps a reappraisal of exceptional and critical points within dissipative quantum systems more generally. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Accidental Injuries; Asthma; Humans; Phase Transition; Photons; Physical Examination; accidental injury; asthma; human; phase transition; photon; physical examination","Royal Society, (RGS/R1 /211220, URF/R1/201158); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (465469/2014-0)","CAD is supported by the Royal Society via a University Research Fellowship (URF/R1/201158) and a Royal Society Research Grant (RGS/R1 /211220).

While self-testing in bipartite Bell scenarios has been thoroughly studied, self-testing in the more complex multipartite Bell scenarios remains largely unexplored. We present a simple and broadly applicable self-testing scheme for N-partite correlation Bell inequalities with two binary outcome observables per party. To showcase the versatility of our proof technique, we obtain self-testing statements for the MABK and WWWŻB family of linear Bell inequalities and Uffink’s family of quadratic Bell inequalities. In particular, we show that the N-partite MABK and Uffink’s quadratic Bell inequalities self-test the GHZ state and anti-commuting observables for each party. While the former uniquely specifies the state, the latter allows for an arbitrary relative phase. To demonstrate the operational relevance of the relative phase, we introduce Uffink’s complex-valued N partite Bell expression, whose extremal values self-test the GHZ states and uniquely specify the relative phase. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Bell's inequality; Complex-valued; GHZ-state; N-partite; Quantum device; Relative phasis; Self test; Self-testing; Simple++; Testing schemes; Bells","NCN SONATA-BIS, (2017/26/E/ST2/01008); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; Narodowe Centrum Badań i Rozwoju, NCBR, (2/2020); Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP","We would like to thank Anubhav Chaturvedi, Nicolás Gigena, and Marek Żukowski for insightful discussions.

Similarly to banknotes, they should be easy to use, unique, tamper-resistant and untraceable, but additionally withstand digital attackers and data breaches. Current technology substitutes customers’ sensitive data by randomized tokens, and secures the payment’s uniqueness with a cryptographic function, called a cryptogram. However, computationally powerful attacks violate the security of these functions. Quantum technology comes with the potential to protect even against infinite computational power. Here, we show how quantum light can secure daily digital payments by generating inherently unforgeable quantum cryptograms. We implement the scheme over an urban optical fiber link, and show its robustness to noise and loss-dependent attacks. Unlike previously proposed protocols, our solution does not depend on long-term quantum storage or trusted agents and authenticated channels. It is practical with near-term technology and may herald an era of quantum-enabled security. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Optical Fibers; Technology; Trust; glass fiber; light effect; noise; optical method; quantum mechanics; Article; correlation function; cryptocurrency; digital payment; economic aspect; encryption; global positioning system; interpersonal communication; polarization; quantum mechanics; technology; trust","Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science, and Research; BeyondC; European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation program, (101114043, 820474, 899368); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-21- 1-0355); Österreichische Nationalstiftung für Forschung, Technologie und Entwicklung; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (801110); Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (F7113); Christian Doppler Forschungsgesellschaft, CDG; Bundesministerium für Digitalisierung und Wirtschaftsstandort, BMDW; Bundesministerium für Bildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung, BMBWF","P.S., J.K., E.S., M.-C.R., T.G., M.B., and P.W. acknowledge funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation program under Grant Agreement No. 101114043 (QSNP) and No. 899368 (EPIQUS), along with the Quantum Flagship under grant No. 820474 (UNIQORN).

The ultimate limit of this sensitivity is dictated by the quantum Cramér–Rao bound. On the other hand, the quantum speed limit bounds the speed of dynamics of any quantum process. We show that the speed limit of quantum dynamics sets a fundamental bound on the minimum attainable phase estimation error through the quantum Cramér–Rao bound, relating the precision directly to the underlying dynamics of the system. In particular, various metrologically important states are considered, and their dynamical speeds are analyzed.

However, the lack of large-area superconducting IC has hindered the development of scalable practical systems. Herein, we describe a novel approach to interconnect 16 high-resolution deep UV (DUV EX4, 248 nm lithography) full reticle circuits to fabricate an extremely large (88 mm × 88 mm) area superconducting integrated circuit (ELASIC). The fabrication process starts by interconnecting four high-resolution DUV EX4 (22 mm × 22 mm) full reticles using a single large-field (44 mm × 44 mm) I-line (365 nm lithography) reticle, followed by I-line reticle stitching at the boundaries of 44 mm × 44 mm fields to fabricate the complete ELASIC field (88 mm × 88 mm). The ELASIC demonstrated a 2X–12X reduction in circuit features and maintained high-stitched line superconducting critical currents. We examined quantum flux parametron circuits to demonstrate the viability of common active components used for data buffering and transmission. Considering that no stitching requirement for high-resolution EX4 DUV reticles is employed, the present fabrication process has the potential to advance the scaling of superconducting qubits and other tri-layer junction-based devices. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering; U.S. Air Force, USAF, (FA8702-15-D-0001)","This material is based on work supported by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering under Air Force Contract No. FA8702-15-D-0001.

Fault tolerance and universality are also realizable by preparing appropriate resource quantum states and electro-optical feedforward that is altered based on measurement results. While linear feedforward has been realized and become a common experimental technique, nonlinear feedforward was unrealized until now. In this paper, we demonstrate that a fast and flexible nonlinear feedforward realizes the essential measurement required for fault-tolerant and universal quantum computation. Using non-Gaussian ancillary states, we observed 10% reduction of the measurement excess noise relative to classical vacuum ancilla. © 2023, The Author(s).","","computer; detection method; measurement method; reduction; article; noise; vacuum","Forefront Physics and Mathematics Program; HORIZON Research and Innovation Actions, (101080173, 21-13265X); Nichia Corporation; Canadian Space Agency, CSA; European Commission, EC, (951737); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (18H05207, 21J11615); Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR; Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (JPMJMS2064); Research Foundation for Opto-Science and Technology, REFOST; Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, Australian Research Council, CQC2T, (22-08772S, CE170100012); University of Tokyo Foundation, UTF","Funding text 1: This work was partly supported by Japan Science and Technology Agency (Moonshot R&D) Grant No. JPMJMS2064, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI Grant No. 18H05207 and No. 21J11615, the UTokyo Foundation, and donations from Nichia Corporation.

The system comprises a superconducting flux qubit (FQ) and a quarter-wavelength coplanar waveguide resonator (λ/ 4 CPWR) that are coupled inductively through a shared edge that contains a Josephson junction to achieve the DSC regime. Spectroscopy is performed around the frequency of the fundamental mode of the CPWR, and the spectrum is fitted by the single-mode quantum Rabi Hamiltonian to obtain the system parameters. Since the qubit is also coupled to a large number of higher modes in the resonator, the single-mode fitting does not provide the bare qubit energy but a value that incorporates the renormalization from all the other modes. We derive theoretical formulas for the Lamb shift in the multimode resonator system. As shown in previous studies, there is a cut-off frequency ωcutoff for the coupling between the FQ and the modes in the CPWR, where the coupling grows as ωn for ωn/ ωcutoff≪ 1 and decreases as 1/ωn for ωn/ ωcutoff≫ 1 . Here ωn is the frequency of the nth mode. The cut-off effect occurs because the qubit acts as an obstacle for the current in the resonator, which suppresses the current of the modes above ωcutoff at the location of the qubit and results in a reduced coupling strength. Using our observed spectrum and theoretical formulas, we estimate that the Lamb shift from the fundamental mode is 82.3% and the total Lamb shift from all the modes is 96.5%. This result illustrates that the coupling to the large number of modes in a CPWR yields an extremely large Lamb shift but does not suppress the qubit energy to zero, which would happen in the absence of a high-frequency cut-off. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Humans; Seizures; human; seizure","Japan Science and Technology Agency Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology, (JPMJCR1775)","The authors would like to thank Adrian Parra-Rodriguez for the useful discussions.

However, more developments are still needed for better preparation of isolated few-spin systems. In this work, we demonstrate a highly nonlinear spin-discriminating (HNSD) method for isolating an arbitrary few-level manifold out of a larger total number of spin ground states in fermionic alkaline-earth atoms. With this method, we realize large and tunable energy shifts for unwanted spin states while inducing negligible shifts for the spin states of interest, which leads to a highly isolated few-spin system under minimal perturbation. Furthermore, the isolated few-spin system exhibits a long lifetime on the hundred-millisecond scale. Using the HNSD method, we demonstrate a characteristic Rabi oscillation between the two states of an isolated two-spin Fermi gas. Our method has wide applicability for realizing long-lived two-spin or high-spin quantum systems based on alkaline-earth fermions.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2023, Higher Education Press.","a.c.

Botanical supplements are known to be vulnerable to contamination and adulteration, and emerging technologies show promise to improve their quality control. Methods: Untargeted and semi-targeted metabolomics based on UHPLC-QTOF-ESI+MS techniques, UV spectrometry, and DNA metabarcoding using Illumina MiSeq were used to authenticate eighteen milk thistle botanical formulations (teas, capsules, tablets, emulsion). Results: Untargeted metabolomics separated 217 molecules and by multivariate analysis the discrimination between the different preparations was established. The semi-targeted metabolomics focused on 63 phytochemicals, mainly silymarin flavonolignans and flavonoids, that may be considered as putative biomarkers of authenticity. All formulations contained molecules from silymarin complexes at different levels. The quantitative evaluation of silybins was done using in parallel UV spectrometry and UHPLC-QTOF-ESI+MS and their correlations were compared. DNA metabarcoding detected milk thistle in eleven out of sixteen retained preparations, whereas two others had incomplete evidence of milk thistle despite metabolomics validating specific metabolites, e.g., silymarin complex, identified and quantified in all samples. Meanwhile, the DNA metabarcoding provided insights into the total species composition allowing the interpretation of the results in a broad context. Conclusion: Our study emphasizes that combining spectroscopic, chromatographic, and genetic techniques bring complementary information to guarantee the quality of the botanical formulations. © 2023, The Author(s).","Authentication; Commercial products; DNA metabarcoding; Metabolomics; Milk thistle; Quality; Silybum marianum (L.)

With the advent of physical quantum computers, it has become possible to apply quantum machine learning algorithms to translate theoretical research into practical solutions. Previous studies have shown the advantages of quantum algorithms on artificially generated datasets, and initial experiments with small binary classification problems have yielded comparable outcomes to classical algorithms. However, it is essential to investigate the potential quantum advantage using real-world data. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to propose the utilization of quantum systems to classify neuron morphologies, thereby enhancing our understanding of the performance of automatic multiclass neuron classification using quantum kernel methods. We examined the influence of feature engineering on classification accuracy and found that quantum kernel methods achieved similar performance to classical methods, with certain advantages observed in various configurations. © 2023, The Author(s).","","article; kernel method; machine learning; nerve cell","","","X.

At present, the prognostic prediction in advanced oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) is based on the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system, and the most used imaging modality in these patients is magnetic resonance image (MRI). With the aim to improve the prediction, we developed an MRI-based radiomic signature as a prognostic marker for overall survival (OS) in OCSCC patients and compared it with published gene expression signatures for prognosis of OS in head and neck cancer patients, replicated herein on our OCSCC dataset. Methods: For each patient, 1072 radiomic features were extracted from T1 and T2-weighted MRI (T1w and T2w). Features selection was performed, and an optimal set of five of them was used to fit a Cox proportional hazard regression model for OS. The radiomic signature was developed on a multi-centric locally advanced OCSCC retrospective dataset (n = 123) and validated on a prospective cohort (n = 108). Results: The performance of the signature was evaluated in terms of C-index (0.68 (IQR 0.66–0.70)), hazard ratio (HR 2.64 (95% CI 1.62–4.31)), and high/low risk group stratification (log-rank p < 0.001, Kaplan-Meier curves). When tested on a multi-centric prospective cohort (n = 108), the signature had a C-index of 0.62 (IQR 0.58–0.64) and outperformed the clinical and pathologic TNM stage and six out of seven gene expression prognostic signatures. In addition, the significant difference of the radiomic signature between stages III and IVa/b in patients receiving surgery suggests a potential association of MRI features with the pathologic stage. Conclusions: Overall, the present study suggests that MRI signatures, containing non-invasive and cost-effective remarkable information, could be exploited as prognostic tools. © 2023, The Author(s).","Head and neck cancer; Magnetic resonance imaging; Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma; Overall survival; Radiogenomics; Radiomics; Survival models","adult; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical trial (topic); cohort analysis; female; gene expression; genomics; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; image analysis; image segmentation; Kaplan Meier method; major clinical study; male; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; overall survival; prospective study; radiogenomics; radiomics; regression model; risk assessment; RNA extraction; survival analysis; T1 weighted imaging; T2 weighted imaging","","","A.

We present a shell-model quantum circuit design strategy to find nuclear ground states by exploiting an adaptive variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. Our circuit implementation is in excellent agreement with classical shell-model simulations for a dozen of light and medium-mass nuclei, including neon and calcium isotopes. We quantify the circuit depth, width and number of gates to encode realistic shell-model wavefunctions. Our strategy also addresses explicitly energy measurements and the required number of circuits to perform them. Our simulated circuits approach the benchmark results exponentially with a polynomial scaling in quantum resources for each nucleus. This work paves the way for quantum computing shell-model studies across the nuclear chart and our quantum resource quantification may be used in configuration-interaction calculations of other fermionic systems. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation of the Spanish Government; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (951911); Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Manchester, FSE, (CEX2019-000918-M, MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033); European Commission, EC, (PID2020-118758GB-I00, RYC-2017-22781, RYC2018-026072)","A.M.R. thanks J.

However, their application to the fast generation of multi-partite quantum gates is still not optimized. Here we propose the reverse-engineering approach to design the longitudinal coupling between a set of qubits coupled to several field modes, for achieving a fast generation of multi-partite quantum gates in photonic or qubit-based architecture. We show that the enhancing generation time is at the nanosecond scale that does not scale with the number of system components. In addition, our protocol does not suffer noticeable detrimental effects due to the dissipative dynamics. Finally, the possible implementation is discussed with the state-of-the-art circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Electrodynamics; Logic gates; Quantum electronics; Timing circuits; Adiabatic criterion; Adiabaticity; Control task; Generation time; IMPROVE-A; Longitudinal coupling; Quantum control; Quantum gates; State generations; Superconducting circuit; Qubits","Financiamiento Basal para Centros Científicos y Tecnológicos de Excelencia, (AFB220001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12075145); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (13N16149); Eusko Jaurlaritza, (IT1470-22, MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, PID2021-126273NB-I00); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (101113946 OpenSuperQPlus100, 2019SHZDZX01-ZX04, 899368, HORIZON-CL4-2022-QUANTUM-01-SGA); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (KK-2021/00070, PID2021-126694NB-C21)","F.A.C.L. thanks to A.

A common approach to this task is to harness recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, while their predictions are quite accurate, their learning process is complex and, thus, time and energy consuming. Here, we propose to extend the concept of RRNs by including continuous-variable quantum resources in it and to use a quantum-enhanced RNN to overcome these obstacles. The design of the continuous-variable quantum RNN (CV-QRNN) is rooted in the continuous-variable quantum computing paradigm. By performing extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the quantum network is capable of learning-time dependence of several types of temporal data and that it converges to the optimal weights in fewer epochs than a classical network. Furthermore, for a small number of trainable parameters, it can achieve lower losses than its classical counterpart. CV-QRNN can be implemented using commercially available quantum-photonic hardware. © 2023, The Author(s).","Continuous variables; Quantum advantage; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum photonics; Time series","Learning systems; Quantum computers; Recurrent neural networks; Continuous variables; Human activities; Machine-learning; Quantum advantage; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum photonics; Time series prediction; Times series; Time series","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (101017733, 2021/03/Y/ST2/00177, 956071); Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (2019/34/E/ST2/00273)","M.S. and M.St. were supported by the National Science Centre “Sonata Bis” project No. 2019/34/E/ST2/00273.

For emitters with a spin-preserving optical transition, spin readout can be achieved by driving the transition with a laser and detecting the emitted photons. The speed and fidelity of this approach is typically limited by low photon collection rates and measurement back-action. Here we use an open microcavity to enhance the optical readout signal from a semiconductor quantum dot spin state, largely overcoming these limitations. We achieve single-shot readout of an electron spin in only 3 nanoseconds with a fidelity of (95.2 ± 0.7)%, and observe quantum jumps using repeated single-shot measurements. Owing to the speed of our readout, errors resulting from measurement-induced back-action have minimal impact. Our work reduces the spin readout-time well below both the achievable spin relaxation and dephasing times in semiconductor quantum dots, opening up new possibilities for their use in quantum technologies. © 2023, The Author(s).","","quantum dot; electron; laser method; quantum mechanics; signal processing; Article; electron; leisure; Monte Carlo method; photon; velocity","","","M.R.

Here, the environment is dynamically downfolded on the correlated subspace. It is captured via renormalization of one and two quasiparticle interaction terms which are evaluated using many-body perturbation theory. We outline the strategy on how to take the dynamical effects into account by going beyond the static limit approximation. Further, we introduce an efficient stochastic implementation that enables treating the host environment with a large number of electrons at a minimal computational cost. For a small explicitly correlated subspace, the dynamical effects are critical. We demonstrate the methodology by reproducing optical excitations in the negatively charged NV center defect in diamond, that agree with experimental results. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Computation theory; Perturbation techniques; Quantum theory; Dynamical effects; Host mediums; Interaction term; Localised; Many body perturbation theory; Quantum state; Renormalization; Static limits; Stochastic implementation; Two-quasiparticle; Stochastic systems","Center for Scientific Computing; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS-1725797, DMR-1720256); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC, (BES-ERCAP0020089, DE-AC02-05CH11231, TG-CHE180051); Advanced Scientific Computing Research, ASCR, (DE-SC0022198); University of California, Santa Barbara, UCSB, (2139319); Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Harvard University, MRSEC; California NanoSystems Institute, CNSI","Funding text 1: The calculations were also performed as part of the XSEDE computational Project No. TG-CHE180051.
