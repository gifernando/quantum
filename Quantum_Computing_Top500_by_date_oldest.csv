The most striking example is the factoring problem. It has recently been shown that computers that exploit quantum features could factor large composite integers. This task is believed to be out of reach of classical computers as soon as the number of digits in the number to factor exceeds a certain limit. The additional power of quantum computers comes from the possibility of employing a superposition of states, of following many distinct computation paths and of producing a final output that depends on the interference of all of them. This ‘quantum parallelism’ outstrips by far any parallelism that can be thought of in classical computation and is responsible for the ‘exponential’ speed-up of computation. Experimentally, however, it will be extremely difficult to ‘decouple’ a quantum computer from its environment. Noise fluctuations due to the outside world, no matter how little, are sufficient to drastically reduce the performance of these new computing devices. To control the nefarious effects of this environmental noise, one needs to implement efficient error-correcting techniques. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","","","Landauer R., IBM J.

Another method establishes identical keys at two distant locations without transferring any information at all. This is performed using the nonlocal properties of two-photon interferometers. Another approach transmits the key in the form of single photons and relies on the quantum-mechanical uncertainty principle to prevent the possibility of eavesdropping.","","Communication channels (information theory); Computer networks; Errors; Interferometers; Interferometry; Optical variables measurement; Personal computers; Photons; Polarization; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Security of data; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum measurement; Cryptography","","","","","","","","","","Optical Soc of America","","","","","","10476938","","OPPHE","","English","Opt Photonics News","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029276834"

Such devices can efficiently perform classes of computation (e.g. factorisation) which are believed to be intractable on any classical computer. This makes it highly desirable to construct such devices. In this paper, we address the last remaining theoretical obstacle to such a construction, namely the problem of stability or error correction. This problem is more substantial in quantum computation than in classical computation because of the delicate nature of the interference phenomena on which quantum computation depends. We present a new, purely quantum mechanical method of error correction, which has no classical analogue, but can serve to stabilise coherent quantum computations. Like the classical methods, it utilises redundancy, but it does not depend on measuring intermediate results of the computation. © 1994 IEEE.","","Error correction; Quantum theory; Classical methods; Coherent quantum superposition; Computational task; Interference phenomena; Intermediate results; Quantum mechanical effects; Quantum mechanical method; Quantum computers","","","","","","","Berstein E., Vazirani U., Quantum complexity theory, Proc. 25th ACMSymp. on the Theory of Computation, pp. 11-20, (1993); Deutsch D., Quantum theory the church-turing principle and the universal quantum computer, Proc.

Shor (1994) has shown that quantum computers (computers which can operate simultaneously on a quantum superposition of inputs) permit efficient (i.e. polynomial-time) solutions of problems for which no efficient classical-mechanical solution is known. This has led to renewed interest in the question of whether or not quantum computers can be physically realized. One kind of quantum computer, quantum cellular automata, can be described by relatively simple Hamiltonians that resemble the Hamiltonians of spin systems. In this paper, we report a quantum cellular automaton which, though not itself computation-universal, forms an essential part of any quantum cellular automaton which is synchronized using Feynman's technique. This quantum cellular automaton has as its Hamiltonian the one-dimensional XY Hamiltonian, which is exactly solvable. Furthermore, there is experimental evidence from low-temperature measurements of the heat capacity and electric susceptibility that the Hamiltonian of the quantum cellular automaton is realized in nature by the rare-earth compound praseodymium ethyl sulfate near 1 K. © 1994 IEEE.","","Cellular automata; Low temperature effects; One dimensional; Polynomial approximation; Praseodymium compounds; Quantum theory; Qubits; Rare earths; Specific heat; Sulfur compounds; Temperature; Temperature measurement; Electric susceptibility; Ethyl sulfate; Experimental evidence; Low-temperature measurements; Polynomial-time; Quantum Cellular automata; Quantum superpositions; Spin systems; Hamiltonians","","","","","","","Benioff Paul A., The computer as a physical system: A microscopic quantum mechanical hamiltonian model of computers as represented by turing machines, Journal of Statistical Mechanics, 22, pp. 563-591, (1980); Benioff P.A., Quantum mechanical hamiltonian models of computers, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 480, pp. 475-486, (1986); Bennett C.H., Thermodynamics of computation, International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 21, pp. 905-940, (1982); Michael B., A Computational Role for the One-dimensional XY Model, (1993); Michael B., Universal computation in few-body automata, Complex Systems, 7, pp. 221-239, (1993); David D., Quantum theory, the Church-Turing principle and the universal quanturn computer, Proceedings of the Royal Academy of London A, 400, pp. 97-117, (1985); Feynman Richard P., Quantum mechanical computers, Foundations of Physics, 16, (1986); Folinsbee J.T., Harrison J.P., Mc-Coll D.B., Taylor D.R., Specific heat, electric susceptibility and thermal conductivity of praseodymium ethyl sulphate: A one-dimensional electric dipolar XY system, Journal of Physics C, 10, pp. 743-759, (1977); Harrison J.P., Hessler Jan P., Taylor D.R., One-and three-dimensional antifer-romagnetic ordering in PrCl3, Physical Review B, 14, pp. 2979-2982, (1976); Landauer R., Is quantum mechanics useful?, Proceedings of the Royal Society London A, (1994); Lieb E.H., Shultz T., Mattis D.C., Two soluble models of an antiferromagnetic chain, Annals of Physics (N.Y.), 16, pp. 407-466, (1961); Norman M., Quantum computation, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 480, pp. 487-497, (1986); Norman M., Parallel quantum computation, Complexity, Entropy and the Physics of Information, pp. 301-318, (1990); Mattis D.C., Theory of Magnetism, 1, (1985); Shor P., Algorithms for quantum computation: Discrete log and factoring, Proceedings of the 26th Annual ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing, 35, pp. 1-14, (1994); Unruh W.G., Maintaining coherence in quantum computers, Physical Review Letters, (1994)","M.

But these ideas have not found much support in biology or psychology until now. However, modern system theory dealing with complex self-referential systems might cast a new light upon this question. Since quantum mechanical observables cannot be applied directly to complex systems, a categorical analysis of those systems is necessary. After discussing some general features of quantum theory a phenomenological non-classical model to describe highly complex systems in developed. It is argued that structure and function can be seen as complementary categories of complex systems which lead to the formulation of uncertainty relations. Furthermore non-locality is regarded as a crucial criterion for the underlying non-classical structure of complex systems. The outcome of a psychological experiment is reported which is suggestive of non-local correlations within man-machine interaction. The results of this experiment support the model that a self-referential complex system may be able to select certain noise fluctuations from a causally separated system via non-local correlations if a feedback-loop generates an “organizational closure” of the “observer” and the “observed”.

The generalized logic can represent both combinatorial and sequential circuits, and also demonstrates interesting properties suggestive of both classical and quantum physics, including superposition, interference,and quantum coherence. A solution is given to the ""Square Root of NOT"" problem, a function not realizable with isolated classical circuits,and it is shown how this circuit may also be interpreted to represent the equivalent quantum computer circuit.

The distribution functions at the boundaries of the double barrier structure are evaluated, taking into account both tunneling and phonon scattering processes. It si found that velocity overshoot occurs in a region of 50 nm within the double barrier region, with a peak velocity of about 8×107 cm/sec occurring immediately after injection. The velocity falls rapidly to 7-8×106 cm/sec over a distance of 50 nm. Due to the high energy of carriers injected from the quantum well and the presence of high electric fields, the extent of the velocity overshoot in the drift region of QWITT diodes is limited. © 1991 IEEE.","Boltzmann equation; Electron devices; Frequency; Microelectronics; Microwave devices; Quantum computing; Quantum mechanics; Resonant tunneling devices; Semiconductor diodes; Steady-state","Boltzmann equation; Computation theory; Distribution functions; Electric fields; Electron devices; Microelectronics; Microwave devices; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Resonant tunneling; Resonant tunneling diodes; Schrodinger equation; Semiconductor devices; Semiconductor quantum wells; Velocity; Boltzmann transport equation; Double barrier quantum wells; Frequency; Quantum Computing; Quantum well injection transit; Resonant tunneling device; Schrodinger equation model; Steady state; Semiconductor diodes","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","International Electron Devices Meeting, IEDM 1991","8 December 1991 through 11 December 1991","Washington","117544","01631918","0780302435","TDIMD","","English","Tech.

Sound is propagated through the m.c.m. moving along the microtubules and microfilaments and the molecular bridges uniting them which serve as elementary switches. The m.c.m. unites the input ionic channels decoding synaptic information into sound signals with the output ionic channels of the membrane of the neurone which are controlled by the sound signals processed by the cytoskeleton net. Thus, the output of the system depends on the input controlled by synaptic activity and the construction and state of the intraneuronal computing medium. It is assumed that sound waves spreading through the different computing media solve different physical tasks. The construction of the computing part of the cytoskeleton accoridng to this hypothesis differs in different neurones thanks to the production of special proteins with the aid of the DNA-RNA-protein transducer of the molecular layers. The influence of the existence of limiting quantum computers on the bases of physics and mathematics and, in particular, the need to replace the physical principle of relativity by the principle of optimality for complex tasts, in the solution of which the influence of computation on the task is crucial, is discussed. © 1991.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00063509","","","","English","Biophysics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-45149138461"

Seed germination provides an analogy that helps to elicit the control and information processing capabilities of enzymatic networks. Like a seed, the enzyme takes a particular action (complexes with a specific substrate and catalyzes a specific reaction) when a specific set of milieu influences is satisfied. The context sensitivity, specificity and speed are enormously enhanced by the parallelism inherent in the electronic wave function (i.e. by the superposition of electronic states). This parallelism is converted to speedup through electronic-conformational interactions. The quantum speedup effect allows biological 'switches' to have qualitatively greater pattern recognition capabilities than electronic switches. Consequently the information processing and control capabilities of biomolecular systems exceed the capabilities obtainable from classical models and exceed the intuitive expectations that have developed through the study of such models. © 1992.","Biomolecular information processing; Enzyme catalysis; Molecular computing; Quantum computing; Self-assembly","Automatic Data Processing; Catalysis; Computer Simulation; Electrochemistry; Enzymes; Models, Biological; Molecular Biology; Neural Networks (Computer); Seeds; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; conference paper; enzyme mechanism; germination; information processing; priority journal","","Enzymes, ","","","U.S. National Science Foundation, (ECS-9109860)","This research was supported in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant ECS-9109860).","Beratan, Onuchic, Betts, Bowler, Gray, Electron-tunneling pathways in ruthenated proteins, J.

These models include quantum Turing machines and quantum circuits. In this paper we define another quantum computational model, one-dimensional quantum cellular automata, and demonstrate that any quantum Turing machine can be efficiently simulated by a one-dimensional quantum cellular automaton with constant slowdown. This can be accomplished by consideration of a restricted class of one-dimensional quantum cellular automata called one-dimensional partitioned quantum cellular automata. We also show that any one-dimensional partitioned quantum cellular automaton can be simulated by a quantum Turing machine with linear slowdown, but the problem of efficiently simulating an arbitrary one-dimensional quantum cellular automaton with a quantum Turing machine is left open. From this discussion, some interesting facts concerning these models are easily deduced.","","Computational methods; Computer circuits; Computer simulation; Mathematical models; Quantum theory; Turing machines; One dimensional quantum cellular automata; Quantum circuits; Quantum computers; Automata theory","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE","Proceedings of the 1995 IEEE 36th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","23 October 1995 through 25 October 1995","Milwaukee, WI, USA","44186","02725428","","ASFPD","","English","Annu Symp Found Comput Sci Proc","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029541042"

The array includes a circuit for modular exponentiation with several subcomponents (such as controlled multipliers and adders) that are described in terms of elementary Toffoli gates. We present a simple analysis of the impact of losses and decoherence on the performance of this quantum factoring circuit. For that purpose, we simulate a quantum computer that is running the program to factor N=15 while interacting with a dissipative environment. As a consequence of this interaction, randomly selected quantum bits (qubits) may spontaneously decay. Using the results of our numerical simulations, we analyze the efficiency of some simple error correction techniques. © 1996 The American Physical Society.","","Algorithms; Computation theory; Computer simulation; Error correction; Fourier transforms; Logic gates; Polynomials; Decoherence; Exponentiation; Factoring circuits; Quantum computer; Quantum gates; Shor's algorithms; Toffoli gates; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Lloyd S., Sci.

We show that any cryptosystem based on what we refer to as a ‘hidden linear form’ can be broken in quantum polynomial time. Our results imply that the discrete log problem is doable in quantum polynomial time over any group including Galois fields and elliptic curves.

By using a dual-rail quantum-bit representation as a simple form of error correction, our machine can tolerate some amount of decoherence and still give the correct result with high probability. The design that we employ also demonstrates a signature for quantum parallelism which unambiguously distinguishes the desired quantum behavior from the merely classical. The experimental demonstration of our proposal using quantum optical components calls for the development of several key technologies common to single photonics. © 1995 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Shor P., Proceedings of the 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, (1994); Schumacher B.; Zurek W.H., Preferred States, Predictability, Classicality and the Environment-Induced Decoherence, Progress of Theoretical Physics, 89, (1993); Landauer R., J.

These tests include local hidden variables theories, pre- and postselection, QND measurements and quantum computing, and tests of quantum mechanics itself against, e.g., the so-called causal communication constraint. We show how to produce nonlocal states of the electromagnetic field which are located in several cavities and are highly entangled. We first discuss a two-cavity state, one of the four Bell basis states for this system, in which both cavities are in a one-photon state or both are in the vacuum state. We then discuss a straightforward generalization to a similar n-cavity state. These states can be produced by sending apropnately prepared atoms through the cavities. As applications we present a test of quantum mechanics against the causal communication constraint using the two-cavity state and a test of the pre- and postselection quantum mechanics using the three-cavity state.","","","","","","","","","Bell J.S., Physics, 1, (1964); Greenberger D., Horne M., Zeilinger A., Bells' Theorem, Quantum Theory, and Conceptions of the Universe, (1989); Tsirelson B.S., Lett.

In fact, P. W. Shor showed that a quantum computer can find discrete logarithms and factor integers in polynomial time with bounded error probability. No polynomial time algorithms to find them using ordinary computers are known. In this paper, we show that the cycles in some kinds of periodic functions, e. g. , functions proposed as pseudo-random generators, can be found in polynomial time with bounded error probability on a quantum Turing machine. In general, it is known that ordinary computers take exponential time to find the cycles in periodic functions.","Cycle; Periodic function; Pseudo-random generator; Quantum luring machine; Shor's quantum algorithm","Algorithms; Computers; Errors; Finite automata; Functions; Matrix algebra; Polynomials; Probability; Set theory; Turing machines; Bounded error probability; Cycle problem; Periodic functions; Pseudorandom generators; Quantum computers; Quantum tuning machine; Shor's quantum algorithm; State transition function; Computational complexity","","","","","","","Alexi W., Chor B., Goldreich O., Schnorr C.P., RSA and Rabin functions: Certain parts are as hard as the whole,, SIAM J.

We show that the Toffoli gate, which is the universal gate for all classical reversible computation, can be implemented using a particular sequence of exactly five two-bit gates. An arbitrary three-bit unitary gate, which can be used to build up any arbitrary quantum computation, can be implemented exactly with six two-bit gates. The ease of implementation of any particular quantum operation is dependent upon a very nonclassical feature of the operation, its exact quantum phase factor. © 1994 IEEE.","","Computation theory; Logic gates; Quantum theory; Qubits; Numerical results; Quantum operations; Quantum phase; Reversible computations; Toffoli gates; Two-bit gates; Unitary gates; Universal gates; Computer circuits","","","","","Jiangsu National Natural Science Foundation, (BK2005082); State Key Fundamental Research and Development Program, (2002CB412307)","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Guoxiang Wang for helping in operation of the Diving PAM.

For jellium, Ceperley and Alder demonstrated, in the ′80s, by quantum computer simulation, that the Wigner electron crystal formed when the mean interelectronic spacing rs was ˜80–100 Bohr radii. The electron crystal is (a) an insulator, (b) magnetic, probably with long‐range Néel‐type antiferromagnetism, (c) phononlike in its low‐lying non‐current‐carrying excited states, and (d) defective at elevated temperatures, with hopping conduction likely to occur. Durkan, Elliott, and March pointed out, again some 30 years after Wigner, that, under suitable conditions, Wigner electron crystallization could be aided by appropriate application of magnetic fields. These workers considered n‐type InSb in a magnetic field, and stressed the importance of observing Bragg reflections in X‐ray or neutron experiments. While their considerations were immediately relevant to 3‐dimensional Wigner electron crystals, advances in semiconductor technology have now led Andrei et al. to use a high‐quality GaAs/GaAlAs heterojunction to study 2‐dimensional Wigner crystallization, as induced by application of a magnetic field. Here, after a brief review of these experiments, some discussion is given of the melting curve of a 2‐dimensional Wigner crystal in a magnetic field.

In particular, we have extended a SC formalism developed for atomic and molecular scatterings to allow for the presence of a long-range Coulomb potential. The SC Regge poles and residues are compared with quantum results of Takemasa and Tamura [Phys. Rev. C 18, 1282 (1978)], who numerically integrated the radial Schrödinger equation. The SC computations show that Takemasa and Tamura missed ten poles. Using a modified version of the quantum computer code regge, due to Takemasa, Tamura, and Wolter [Comput. Phys. Commun. 18, 427 (1979)] we have located five of these poles-the remaining poles have residues of modulus <10-8. For low values of the Regge pole quantum number, n, the SC and quantum pole positions are in close agreement, with larger differences for the residues. As n increases, the SC results become less accurate. However at high values of n, the quantum results also lose accuracy due to numerical instabilities in the regge code. It is demonstrated that the choice of Coulomb interaction-charged sphere or pure Coulomb-can significantly effect the properties of the Regge pole positions and residues. © 1993 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Nussenzveig H.M., Diffraction Effects in Semiclassical Scattering, (1992); Newton R.G., The Complex j Plane, (1964); de Alfaro V., Regge T., Potential Scattering, (1965); Brink D.M., Semiclassical Methods for Nucleus-Nucleus Scattering, (1985); Child M.S., Semiclassical Mechanics with Molecular Applications, (1991); McVoy K.W., Phys.

Our purpose is to explore the fundamental limits and constraints imposed on computation by Nature through the laws of physics and the mathematics of computational complexity. Inasmuch as information storage and transmission are an integral part of computation, their physical bounds are considered. The computer is viewed both physically and mathematically as a dynamical system, and is depicted in terms of the basic Turing machine paradigm. Three fundamental classes of the Turing machine are defined; the deterministic, stochastic and quantum Turing machines. Hamiltonian models and physical realizations of quantum computing are described. Quantum computers can perform some tasks which have no classical analogue, but they cannot compute functions that are non-computable by classical means. Some classically intractable problems can be solved with quantum computers. © (1994) 2017 SPIE.","","Dynamical systems; Machinery; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Stochastic systems; Hamiltonian models; Integral part; Laws of physics; Physical realization; Quantum Computing; Quantum mechanical computations; Quantum turing machine; Turing machines","","","","","","","Feynman R.P., The Character of Physical Law, (1965); Turing A.M., Proc.

The total system is considered to be a prototype of quantum computer systems where physical quantum states are employed as logic states of information processing.

The semantic logic of such systems can be exhibited in replacing the differential equations by digital cellular automata. K. Zuse proposed such a method for representing physical systems by a computing space. I show that the digital wave equation exhibits waves by digital particles with interference effects. The logical table of the wave equation shows the conservation of the parity related to exclusive OR. The Fractal Machine proposed by the author deals with a cellular automata based on incursion, an inclusive recursion, with exclusive OR. In this machine, the superimposition of states is related to the Deutsch quantum computer. Finally, it is shown that the exclusive OR can be modelled by a fractal non-linear equation and a new method to design digital equations is proposed to create McCulloch and Pitts formal neurons. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1996.","","Cellular automata; Fractals; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Semantics; System theory; Wave equations; Exclusive-OR; Formal systems; Interference effects; Modelling tools; Physical systems; Recursions; Research and development; Computer circuits","","","","","","","Delahaye J.P., Les ordinateurs quantiques, pp. 100-104, (1995); Deutsch D., Quantum Theory, the Church-Turing Principles and the Universal Quantum computer, Proc.

It is not clear that this is still true if quantum mechanics is taken into account. Feynman seems to have been the first to ask what effect the non-local properties of quantum mechanics have on computation [7, 8]. He gave arguments as to why these properties might make it intrinsically computationally expensive to simulate quantum mechanics on a classical (Von Neumann) computer. He also asked the converse question: whether these properties permit more powerful computation. Several researchers have since developed models for quantum mechanical computers and investigated their computational properties.

Encouraging agreement is obtained in the low-to-moderate relative velocity range, without the use of adjustable parameters. At very high velocities the comparison indicates the occurrence of some vibrational nonadiabaticity. Calculations are presently in progress to see if this nonadiabaticity equals that expected from a companion paper on analytical mechanics of certain collisions. Applications are also made to several topics: relations between classical and quantum computer calculations of cross sections, between activation energy and the recently reported threshold energy of reaction (D+H2→DH+H), and tests of activated-complex theory.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00219606","","","","English","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0011768340"

This is done by exploiting the same aspects of problem structure as used by classical backtrack methods to avoid unproductive search choices. This quantum algorithm is much more likely to find solutions than the simple direct use of quantum parallelism. Furthermore, empirical evaluation on small problems shows this quantum algorithm displays the same phase transition behavior, and at the same location, as seen in many previously studied classical search methods. Specifically, difficult problem instances are concentrated near the abrupt change from underconstrained to overconstrained problems.","","Combinatorial mathematics; Computational complexity; Computers; Constraint theory; Combinatorial search; Quantum algorithm; Quantum computers; Algorithms","","","","","","","Barenco A., Deutsch D., Ekert A., Conditional quantum dynamics and logic gates, Physical Review Letters, 74, pp. 4083-4086, (1995); Benioff P., Quantum mechanical hamiltonian models of Turing machines, J.

However, advances in quantum physics have stimulated interest in its potential impact on such technology. This article is a reasonably introductory review of three aspects of quantum information processing, cryptography, computation, and teleportation. In order to give a level of self-containment, I serve up hors d'oeuvres on the relevant parts of quantum physics and the sorts of quantum systems which might form the building blocks for quantum processors. Quantum cryptography utilizes states of individual quantum systems for the transfer of conventional classical bits of information. The impossibility of measuring quantum systems without disturbing them guarantees the detection of eavesdropping and hence secure information transfer is possible. In a sense, teleportation is the inverse of cryptography, using more robust classical bits to faithfully transfer a quantum state through a noisy environment. Quantum computation utilizes the evolving quantum state of a complex system, which consists of many interacting individuals. If such a machine could be built, it would be capable of solving some problems which are intractable on any conventional computer; I illustrate this with Shor's quantum factoring algorithm. I give some details of the current experimental achievements, proposals, and prospects for the future and of the patents granted to date. © 1996 IEEE.","","Computational complexity; Cryptography; Data processing; Large scale systems; Quantum theory; Quantum cryptography; Quantum information processing; Teleportation; Information technology","","","","","","","Dirac P.A.M., The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, 4th Ed., (1978); Landau L.D., Lifshitz E.M., Quantum Mechanics (Nonrelativistic Theory), 3rd Ed., (1987); Feynman R.P., Leighton R.B., Sands M., The Feynman Lectures on Physics, 3, (1965); The Ghost in the Atom., (1986); Rae A.I.M., Quantum Physics: Illusion or Reality?, (1991); Omnes R., The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics., (1994); Wheeler J.A., Zurek Eds W.H., Quantum Theory and Measurement., (1983); Special issue on single charge tunnelling, Z.

In a phase mode system, device operation depends on the existence of many stable states differing from each other by integer multiples of 2π in the phase plane. As an example, we propose a simple model of a complete phase mode computing system in the present paper, and discuss the basic computer elements and the instructions in this system. The total system is considered to be a prototype of quantum computer systems where physical quantum states are employed as logic states for information processing. © 1991 IEEE","","Logic Circuits; Superconducting Devices--Josephson Junctions; Josephson Logic; Phase Mode Computer Systems; Computers, Digital","","","","","","","Anacker W., Josephson computer technology: An IBM research project, IBM J.

Resonant and dispersive atom-field interactions provide ways to realize quantum states swapping and conditional quantum dynamics. They can be used to produce non local correlations and complex, tailored, entangled quantum states in many particle systems. Fundamental test of quantum mechanics are now within the reach of cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments. Complex quantum states are also at the heart of the recently proposed techniques for quantum information processing or quantum computing, a field boiling with excitement. Although cavity QED techniques allow the realization of some basic components, such as quantum logic gates, they also provide experimental insights into the decoherence processes, which doom any attempt to realize a large scale quantum information processing machine. In the light of recent experiments performed in our laboratory, we discuss realistic perspectives and impossibilities in this field.","","Data processing; Electrodynamics; Millimeter wave devices; Quantum theory; Superconducting devices; Circular Rydberg atoms; Quantum computing; Quantum dynamics; Quantum entanglement; Quantum information processing; Quantum states swapping; Cavity resonators","","","","","","","","","","","Europe Physical Society; Quantum Electronics & Optics Division; IEEE/LEOS; Optical Society of America; European Optical Society","Proceedings of the 1996 European Quantum Electronics Conference, EQEC'96","8 September 1996 through 13 September 1996","Hamburg, Ger","45464","","","00167","","English","Tech Dig Eur Quantum Electron Conf","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029727555"

Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russian Federation","Study of intraneuronal information processing by injection of cAMP has established that the intraneuronal computer is not the usual biochemical system. cAMP is a substance synthesized within the neurone in response to synaptic influences. It is shown that injection of this substance produces a generator potential which appears before the generation of nerve impulses both during the spontaneous activity of the neurone and in the presence of synaptic influences. A hypothesis is proposed that cAMP interacts with the microtubules along which a mechanical signal spreads and the absence of known sources of free energy suggests that for the generation of this signal the heat released by the metabolic processes occurring in the vicinity of the microtubules is used. The unusual energetics of such a process is confirmed experimentally: uncouplers increase the effect of cAMP while metabolism inhibitors suppress it. This gives an indication in support of the previously advanced hypothesis that in live cells the molecular computer assembles a hypersonic quantum computer and controls its work. Three main principles have been proposed for the science uniting physics, mathematics and biology; the principle cf causality affirming that the cause always precedes the effect since the cause of regular events are the solutions of the controlling systems-quantum computers; the principle of the least price of action for control which as an approximation gives the quantum mechanics; and the principle of optimality which disregarding the influence of computation is reduced to the relativity principle. © 1991.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00063509","","","","English","Biophysics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0343058497"

They center around the notion of computability. In this paper we propose a new definition of computability which lays the foundations for a theory of cybernetic and intelligent machines in which the classical limits imposed by discrete algorithmic procedures are offset by the use of continuous operators on unlimited data. This data is supplied to the machine in a totally parallel mode, as a field or wave. This theory of machines draws its concepts from category theory, Lie algebras, and general systems theory. It permits the incorporation of intelligent control into the design of the machine as a virtual element. The incorporated control can be realized in many (machine) configurations of which we give three: a) a quantum mechanical realization appropriate to a possible understanding of the quantum computer and other models of the physical microworld, b) a stochastic realization based on Kolmogorov-Gabor theory leading to a possible understanding of generalised models of the physical or thermodynamic macroworld, and lastly c) a classical mechanical realization appropriate to the study of a new class of robots. Particular applications at a fundamental level are cited in geometry, mathematics, biology, acoustics, aeronautics, quantum mechanics, general relativity and. Markov chains. The proposed theory therefore opens a new way towards understanding the processes that underlie intelligence. © 1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Based on this, Hamiltonian evolution of processes with associated step operators T is investigated here. The main limitation of this paper is to processes which evolve quantum ballistically, i.e., motion restricted to a collection of nonintersecting or distinct paths on an arbitrary basis. The main goal of this paper is proof of a theorem which gives necessary and sufficient conditions that T must satisfy so that there exists a Hamiltonian description of quantum ballistic evolution for the process, namely, that T is a partial isometry and is orthogonality preserving and stable on some basis. Simple examples of quantum ballistic evolution for quantum Turing machines with one and with more than one type of elementary step are discussed. It is seen that for nondeterministic machines the basis set can be quite complex with much entanglement present. It is also proven that, given a step operator T for an arbitrary deterministic quantum Turing machine, it is decidable if T is stable and orthogonality preserving, and if quantum ballistic evolution is possible. The proof fails if T is a step operator for a nondeterministic machine. It is an open question if such a decision procedure exists for nondeterministic machines. This problem does not occur in classical mechanics. Also the definition of quantum Turing machines used here is compared with that used by other authors. © 1996 The American Physical Society.","","Ballistics; Computer simulation; Convergence of numerical methods; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Mathematical operators; Mathematical transformations; Hamiltonian; Orthogonality; Partial isometry; Quantum ballistic evolution; Quantum computers; Quantum Turing machines; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Landauer R., IBM J.

This Hamiltonian generates a dynamical evolution which mimics a sequence of elementary logical steps. This can be achieved if each logical step is locally reversible (global reversibility is insufficient). Computational errors due to noise can be corrected by means of redundancy. In particular, reversible error-correcting codes can be embedded in the Hamiltonian itself. An estimate is given for the minimum amount of entropy which must be dissipated at a given noise level and tolerated error rate. © 1985 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Bennett C.H., Landauer R., Sci.

This quantum example oracle is a natural extension of the traditional PAC example oracle, and it immediately follows that all PAC-learnable function classes are learnable in the quantum model, Furthermore, we obtain positive quantum learning results for classes that are not known to be PAC learnable. Specifically, we show that DNF is efficiently learnable with respect to the uniform distribution by a quantum algorithm using a quantum example oracle. While it was already known that DNF is uniform-leaxnable using a membership oracle, we prove that a quantum example oracle with respect to uniform is less powerful than a membership oracle. We also generalize the notion of classification noise to the quantum setting and show that the quantum DNF algorithm learns even in the presence of such noise. This result contrasts with a recent negative result for DNF in the statistical query model of learning from noisy data. © 1995 ACM.","","Computation theory; Learning systems; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Efficient learning; Natural extension; Quantum algorithms; Quantum learning; Quantum modeling; Quantum setting; Statistical query models; Uniform distribution; Quantum efficiency","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","Funding text 1: †Dept. of Mathematics and Computer Science, Duquesne University, 600 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15282-1754 (jackson@mathcs.duq.edu).

It is not clear whether this is still true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. Several researchers, starting with David Deutsch, have developed models for quantum mechanical computers and have investigated their computational properties. This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems.

The major dichotomy is between evolvability and programmability. Brain models, to be tenable, must pass an extended Turing test in which the capacity to self organize through the Darwinian mechanism of variation and selection is a key element. Programmable machines that simulate the type of structure-function relations that allow evolution to occur are, however, too inefficient in their use of resources for problem solving to support cognitive abilities comparable to those of biological organisms. Furthermore, real evolutionary systems are open in that it is always possible for them to tap previously unexploited physical interactions for computing. Nevertheless, computer simulation provides a powerful tool for studying brain function; and non-programmable designs that exploit the high efficiency, high adaptability domain of computing are in principle possible. © 1989.","Brain models; Evolution; Molecular computing; Quantum computing","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Comparative Study; Computer Simulation; Computers; Evolution; Human; Models, Neurological; Software; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; algorithm; artificial intelligence; biological model; brain; comparative study; computer; computer program; computer simulation; evolution; human; physiology; review","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (IRI 87-02600)","This paper is dedicated to the memory of my father, Earl Conrad.

In arriving at a positive answer, we had to posit a nondeterministic defuzzifying rule. We suggest here that such a rule may be useful in fuzzy operations, especially fuzzy control. It is often possible to construct an optical quantum computer which directly implements nondeterministic defuzzification by quantum indeterminacy. Thus our attempt to use fuzzy logic to understand quantum mechanics leads to a system which uses quantum mechanics to implement fuzzy logic. © 1992 Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

This leads to a discussion of error correction in a quantum communication channel or a quantum computer. Methods of error correction in the quantum regime are presented, and their limitations assessed. A quantum channel can recover from arbitrary decoherence of x qubits if K bits of quantum information are encoded using n quantum bits, where K/n can be greater than 1 -2H(2x/n), but must be less than 1 -2H(x/n). This implies exponential reduction of decoherence with only a polynomial increase in the computing resources required. Therefore quantum computation can be made free of errors in the presence of physically realistic levels of decoherence. The methods also allow isolation of quantum communication from noise and evesdropping (quantum privacy amplification). © 1996 The Royal Society.","","","","","","","","","Barenco A., A universal two-bit gate for quantum computation, Proc.

The wave function of such a quantum computer could consist of a superposition of many com-putations carried out simultaneously; this kind of parallelism could be exploited to make some important computational problems, like the prime factoring of large integers, tractable. However, building such a quantum computer would place undreamed of demands on the experimental realization of highly quantum-coherent systems; present-day experimental capabilities in atomic physics and other fields permit only the most rudimentary implementation of quantum computation.","","Algorithms; Atomic physics; Computation theory; Computational complexity; Computers; Formal logic; Logic gates; Natural sciences computing; Polynomials; Probability; Quantum computation; Quantum computers; Quantum logic; Quantum wave function; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Feynman R.P., Opt.

Factors of an L-digit number can be found in ∼L2 time [compared to ∼exp(L1/3) time] by a quantum computer, which simultaneously follows all paths corresponding to distinct classical inputs, obtaining the solution from the coherent quantum interference of the alternatives. Here it is shown how the decoherence process degrades the interference pattern that emerges from the quantum factoring algorithm. For a quantum computer performing logical operations, an exponential decay of quantum coherence is inevitable. However, even in the presence of exponential decoherence, quantum computation can be useful as long as a sufficiently low decoherence rate can be achieved to allow meaningful results to be extracted from the calculation.","","Algorithms; Computers; Fourier transforms; Number theory; Polynomials; Probability; Quantum theory; Relaxation processes; Decoherence; Factoring; Prime factors; Quantum computers; Digital arithmetic","","","","","","","Graham R., Knuth D.E., Patashnik O., Concrete Mathematics, (1994); Lenstra S.A.K., Lenstra H.W., Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science, A, pp. 673-715, (1990); Pratt V.R., SIAM J.

Maxa Borna 9, Poland","The standard formalism of quantum theory is enhanced and definite meaning is given to the concepts of experiment, measurement and event. Within this approach one obtains a uniquely defined piecewise deterministic algorithm generating quantum jumps, classical events and histories of single quantum objects. The wave‐function Monte Carlo method of Quantum Optics is generalized and promoted to the level of a fundamental process generating all the real events in Nature. The already worked out applications include SQUID‐tank model and generalized cloud chamber model with GRW spontaneous localization as a particular case. Differences between the present approach and quantum measurement theories based on environment‐induced master equations are stressed. Questions: what is classical, what is time, and what observers are addressed. Possible applications of the new approach are suggested, among them connection between the stochastic commutative geometry and Connes' noncommutative formulation of the Standard Model, as well as potential applications to the theory and practice of quantum computers.

Methyl iodide has two dipole accessible and mutually coupled repulsive electronic surfaces at this excitation energy. Thus it is expected that there are interference contributions to the angularly resolved polarized emission spectrum. Using a one-dimensional model and time-independent quantum computations of the emission into ground state C-I overtone vibrations, these interference contributions are shown to significantly influence the polarized emission spectrum and, for example, to produce a counterintuitive dependence on final state overtone number. The calculations demonstrate that the influence of the interference terms is enhanced by the formation of polarized emission intensity ratios because of the differing signs of geometric coefficients associated with the interference terms. We also study the effect of varying the strength of the coupling potential and the range over which it acts. The nonintuitive nature of the interference terms and the amplification of their influence by the formation of polarized emission intensity ratios demonstrate why quantum computations are important for a complete understanding of the polarized emission spectroscopy experiment for methyl iodide. © 1991 American Institute of Physics.","","Emission spectroscopy; Ground state; Quantum computers; Electronic surface; Interference effects; Interference terms; Methyl iodide; One-dimensional model; Polarized emissions; Quantum calculation; Time independents; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Lao K.Q., Person M.D., Xayariboun P., Butler L.J., J.

Interest has since been growing in the area of quantum computation. One of the main difficulties of quantum computation is that decoherence destroys the information in a superposition of states contained in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. It is shown how to reduce the effects of decoherence for information stored in quantum memory, assuming that the decoherence process acts independently on each of the bits stored in memory. This involves the use of a quantum analog of errorcorrecting codes. © 1995 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Deutsch D., Proc. R. Soc. London Ser.

For digital processing in the Ising and Heisenberg chains driven by a resonant electromagnetic field, the simple schemes are suggested which provide correction of errors caused by imperfect π pulses, and prevent the most significant errors caused by the nonresonant action of π pulses. The probability of error caused by the Heisenberg interaction during the action of π pulses is estimated. For quantum computations in spin systems a principal opportunity to correct the phase errors, based on Steaneșs three quantum-bits scheme, is described. © 1997 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Philos.

We derive upper bounds on the size of the numbers that can be factorized on such a quantum computer. These upper bounds are independent of the power of the applied laser. We investigate two possible ways to implement qubits, in metastable optical transitions and in Zeeman sublevels of a stable ground state, and show that in both cases the numbers that can be factorized are not large enough to be of practical interest. We also investigate the effect of quantum error correction on our estimates and show that in realistic systems the impact of quantum error correction is much smaller than expected. Again no number of practical interest can be factorized. © 1997 The Royal Society.","","","","","","","","","Aharonov D., Ben-Or M., Fault Tolerant Quantum Computation with Constant Error, (1996); Andersen T., Sorensen G., Systematic trends in atomic transition probabilities in neutral and singly-ionized zinc, cadmium and mercury, J.

We present here a problem of distinguishing between two fairly natural classes of functions, which can provably be solved exponentially faster in the quantum model than in the classical probabilistic one, when the function is given as an oracle drawn equiprobably from the uniform distribution on either class. We thus offer compelling evidence that the quantum model may have significantly more complexity theoretic power than the PTM. In fact, drawing on this work, Shor has recently developed remarkable new quantum polynomial-time algorithms for the discrete logarithm and integer factoring problems.","Complexity theory; Oracles; Quantum computation","Polynomial approximation; Probability distributions; Quantum theory; Turing machines; Complexity theory; Discrete logarithms; Factoring problem; Oracles; Polynomial-time algorithms; Quantum mechanical; Quantum model of computation; Uniform distribution; Quantum computers","","","","","","","Benioff P., Quantum mechanical Hamiltonian models of Turing machines, J.

The electromagnetic (EM) component of ultralowfrequency (ULF) ""brainwaves"" provides an extraordinary biophysical basis for consciousness-like displays in both normal and altered states of consciousness: it enables perfect fitting with narrowed limits of conscious capacity in normal awake states, very extended limits in altered states of consciousness (due to the relativistic mechanism of dilated ""subjective"" time base), and most peculiar space-time transpersonal interactions in transitional states of consciousness during the interchange of normal and altered states of consciousness (due to the relativistic generation of wormholes in highly noninertial ""subjective"" reference frame, fully equivalent to extremely strong gravitational fields according to Einstein's Principle of equivalence); it also enables the dream-like mixing of the normally conscious and unconscious contents in altered states, due to the relativistic Doppler mapping of the EM component of the ""objective"" ULF brainwave power spectrum on the zero-degeneratefrequency ""subjective"" one. As the rather complex additional low-dielectric (ε                             r                              ≈ 1) weakly ionized gaseous ""optical"" neural network is necessary in these processes, it seems that biological molecular hardware will essentially determine further development of brain-like computers with artificial consciousness, in the form of neural networks with embedded brainwaves-like ULF ionic electrical activity. In transitional states of consciousness such nonprogrammable brain-like computers could be able to solve even most subtle problems creatively, by multiple re-addressing the problem and taking the most frequent solution as the optimal one. As the whole situation resembles on the quantum theory of measurement, such creative brain-like computers with artificial consciousness might be named quantum computers.

Therefore, since the physical world is fundamentally quantum mechanical, the foundations of information theory and computer science should be sought in quantum physics. In fact, quantum information has weird properties that contrast sharply with the familiar properties of classical information. A quantum computer-a new type of machine that exploits the quantum properties of information-could perform certain types of calculations far more efficiently than any foreseeable classical computer. To build a functional quantum computer will be an enormous technical challenge. New methods for quantum error correction are being developed that can help to prevent a quantum computer from crashing. © 1998 IEEE.","","Computation theory; Error correction; Information theory; Quantum computers; Classical information; Physical systems; Quantum error corrections; Quantum Information; Quantum mechanical; Quantum physics; Quantum properties; Technical challenges; Quantum optics","","","","","","","Bell J.S., Physics, 1, (1964); Greenberger D.M., Home M., Zeilinger A., Bell's Theorem, Quantum Mechanics, and Conceptions of the Universe, (1989); Mermin N.D., Physics Today, (1990); Wootters W.K., Zurek W.H., A single quantum cannot be cloned, Nature, 299, (1982); Dieks D., Communication by electron-paramagnetic-resonance devices, Physics Letters A, 92, (1982); Bennett C.H., Brassard G., Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computers, Systems, and Signal Processing, (1984); Feynman R.P., Simulating physics with computers, Internationaljournal of Physics, 21, (1982); Lenstra A.K., Cowie J., Elkenbracht-Huizing M., Furmanski W., Montgomery P.L., Weber D., Zayer J., RSA Factoring-by-web: The World-wide Status, Online Document, (1996); Shor P., Algorithms for quantum computation: Discrete logarithms and factoring, Proceedings of the 35th Annual Symposium of Fundamentals of Computer Science, (1994); Cirac J.I., Zoller P., Quantum computations with cold trapped ions, Physical Review Letters, 74, (1995); Turchette Q.A., Hood C.J., Lange W., Mabuchi H., Kimble H.J., Measurement of conditional phase shift for quantum logic, Physical Review Letters, 75, (1995); Monroe C., Meekhof D.M., King B.E., Itano W.M., Wineland D.J., Demonstration of a fundamental quantum logic gate, Physical Review Letters, 75, (1995); Shor P., Scheme for reducing decoherence in computer memory, Physical Review A, 52, (1995); Steane A.M., Error correcting codes in quantum theory, Physical Review Letters, 78, (1996); Preskill J., Proceedings of Royal Society of London A, 454, (1998)","J.

We present a new computational model, which differs from a QC only in that the result of a measurement is the expectation value of the observable, rather than a random eigenvalue thereof. Such an expectation value QC can solve nondeterministic polynomial-time complete problems in polynomial time. This observation is significant precisely because the computational model can be realized, to a certain extent, by NMR spectroscopy on macroscopic ensembles of quantum spins, namely molecules in a test tube. This is made possible by identifying a manifold of statistical spin states, called pseudo-pure states, the mathematical description of which is isomorphic to that of an isolated spin system. The result is a novel NMR computer that can be programmed much like a QC, but in other respects more closely resembles a DNA computer. Most notably, when applied to intractable combinatorial problems, an NMR computer can use an amount of sample, rather than time, which grows exponentially with the size of the problem. Although NMR computers will be limited by current technology to exhaustive searches over only 15 to 20 bits, searches over as much as 50 bits are in principle possible, and more advanced algorithms could greatly extend the range of applicability of such machines.","DNA computing; NMR; nondeterministic polynomial-time complete; quantum computing","Chemistry; Computing Methodologies; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Physics; Quantum Theory; article; computer; mathematical analysis; mathematical computing; model; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; priority journal; quantum theory","","","","","","","Adleman L., Science, 266, pp. 1021-1024, (1994); Shor P.W., Proceedings of the 35th Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 124-134, (1994); Cook S.A., Proceedings of the Third Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 151-158, (1971); Karp R.M., Complexity of Computer Computations, pp. 85-103, (1972); Garey M.R., Johnson D.S., Computers and Intractability, (1979); Bennett C.H., Bernstein E., Brassard G., Vazirani U., SIAM J.

Some philosophers have contended that 'qualia', or an experiential medium from which consciousness is derived, exists as a fundamental component of reality. Whitehead, for example, described the universe as being comprised of 'occasions of experience'. To examine this possibility scientifically, the very nature of physical reality must be re-examined. We must come to terms with the physics of space-time - as is described by Einstein's general theory of relativity - and its relation to the fundamental theory of matter - as described by quantum theory. This leads us to employ a new physics of objective reduction: 'OR' which appeals to a form of 'quantum gravity' to provide a useful description of fundamental processes at the quantum/classical borderline (Penrose, 1994; 1996). Within the OR scheme, we consider that consciousness occurs if an appropriately organized system is able to develop and maintain quantum coherent superposition until a specific 'objective' criterion (a threshold related to quantum gravity) is reached; the coherent system then self-reduces (objective reduction: OR). We contend that this type of objective self-collapse introduces non-computability, an essential feature of consciousness. OR is taken as an instantaneous event - the climax of a self-organizing process in fundamental space-time - and a candidate for a conscious Whitehead-like 'occasion' of experience. How could an OR process occur in the brain, be coupled to neural activities, and account for other features of consciousness? We nominate an OR process with the requisite characteristics to be occurring in cytoskeletal microtubules within the brain's neurons (Penrose and Hameroff, 1995; Hameroff and Penrose, 1995; 1996). In this model, quantum-superposed states develop in microtubule subunit proteins ('tubulins'), remain coherent, and recruit more superposed tubulins until a mass-time-energy threshold (related to quantum gravity) is reached. At that stage, self-collapse, or objective reduction (OR) abruptly occurs. We equate the pre-reduction, coherent superposition ('quantum computing') phase with pre-conscious processes, and each instantaneous (and non-computable) OR, or self-collapse, with a discrete conscious event. Sequences of OR events give rise to a 'stream' of consciousness. Microtubule-associated proteins can 'tune' the quantum oscillations of the coherent superposed states; the OR is thus self-organized, or 'orchestrated' ('Orch OR'). Each Orch OR event selects (non-computably) microtubule subunit states which regulate synaptic/neural functions using classical signalling. The quantum gravity threshold for self-collapse is relevant to consciousness, according to our arguments, because macroscopic superposed quantum states each have their own space-time geometries (Penrose, 1994; 1996). These geometries are also superposed, and in some way 'separated', but when sufficiently separated, the superposition of space-time geometries becomes signifcantly unstable, and reduce to a single universe state. Quantum gravity determines the scale of the instability; we contend that the actual choice of state made by Nature is non-computable. Thus each Orch OR event is a self-selection of space-time geometry, coupled to the brain through microtubules and other biomolecules. If conscious experience is intimately connected with the very physics underlying space-time structure, then Orch OR in microtubules indeed provides us with a completely new and uniquely promising perspective on the hard problem of consciousness.","","","","","","","","","Aharonov Y., Vaidman L., Properties of a quantum system during the time interval between two measurements, Phys.

We cast here the complicated MT dynamics in the form of a (1 + 1)-dimensional noncritical string theory, thus enabling us to provide a consistent quantum treatment of MTs, including environmental friction effects. We suggest, thus, that the MTs are the microsites, in the brain, for the emergence of stable, macroscopic quantum coherent states, identifiable with the preconscious states. Quantum space-time effects, as described by noncritical string theory, trigger then an organized collapse of the coherent states down to a specific or conscious state. The whole process we estimate to take script O sign(1 sec), in excellent agreement with a plethora of experimental/observational findings. The microscopic arrow of time, endemic in noncritical string theory, and apparent here in the self-collapse process, provides a satisfactory and simple resolution to the age-old problem of how the, central to our feelings of awareness. sensation of the progression of time is generated. In addition, the complete integrability of the stringy model for MT we advocate in this work proves sufficient in providing a satisfactory solution to memory coding and capacity. Such features might turn out to be important for a model of the brain as a quantum computer.","","","","","","","","","Dustin P., MicroTubules, (1984); Engleborghs Y., Nanobiology, 1, (1992); Penrose R., Hameroff S., Orchestrated Reduction of Quantum Coherence in Brain Microtubules: A Model of Consciousness; Penrose R., The Emperor's New Mind, (1989); Shadows of the Mind, (1994); Nanopoulos D.V., Theory of Brain Function, Quantum Mechanics and Superstrings, Proc.

In general case we introduce two pairs of phase operators associated with the phase angles in 3D picture for the polarization Stokes parameters of light on the Poincare sphere. The special eight-port polarization interferometer is presented for simultaneous homodyne detection of both the Stokes parameters of light and the polarization phases and also of their fluctuations. It is shown that an anisotropic (spatio-periodically) Kerr-like nonlinear medium placed in the polarization interferometer can be used for generation and observation of the polarization-squeezed phase (PSP) states of light. ©2004 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Fluctuations of light; Phase measurement; Polarization quantum state; Spatio-periodical nonlinear medium","Birefringence; Fiber lasers; Interferometers; Interferometry; Nonlinear optics; Optical instruments; Phase measurement; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Fluctuations of light; Hermitian; Homodyne detection; Light phase; Optical fields; Phase angles; Poincare sphere; Polarization interferometers; Polarization quantum state; Polarization state (PS); Spatio-periodical nonlinear medium; Stokes parameters; Polarization","","","","","","","Alodjants A.P., Arakelian S.M., Quantum nondemolition measurements in an optical system with two coupled mode under condition of Bragg resonance: Low-power requirements for experimental verification by dual-core optical fibers, Laser Physics (special issue of ""Nonclassical Light""), 4, pp. 765-778, (1994); Chirkin A.S., Orlov A.A., Paraschuk D.Y., Quantum theory of two-mode interactions in optically anisotropic media with cubic nonlinearities: Generation of quadrature- and polarization-squeezed light, Kvantovaya Elektronika, 20, (1993); Alodjants A.P., Arakelian S.M., Chirkin A.S., Formation of polarization-squeezed states of light in spatially periodic nonlinear-optical media, Zh.

The QXOR device can be charged with up to N = 8 electrons. The quantum bits of the device correspond to states of the device in second quantized form. We use exact diagonalization techniques in the configuration space to calculate physical properties of QXOR as a function of the number of electrons N and external perturbations in the form of electric and magnetic fields. This allows us to investigate the switching of the QXOR gate, and its ability to store and transmit information. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.","","Computational methods; Electric field effects; Electron energy levels; Magnetic field effects; Perturbation techniques; Diagonalization; Quantum cellular automata; Semiconductor quantum dots","","","","","","","Ashoori R., Nature, 379, (1996); Hawrylak P., Phys.

The key generation procedure involves the transmission, interception, and reception of two nonorthogonal photon polarization states. At the receiving end, a positive operator valued measure (POVM) is employed in the measurement process. The eavesdropping involves an information-maximizing von Neumann-type projective measurement. We propose a new design for a receiver that is an all-optical realization of the POVM, using a Wollaston prism, a mirror, two beam splitters, a polarization rotator, and three photodetectors. We present a quantitative analysis of the receiver. We obtain closed-form algebraic expressions for the error rates and mutual information, expressed in terms of the POVM-receiver error rate and the angle between the carrier polarization states. We also prove a significant result, namely, that in the entangled translucent eavesdropping approach, the unsafe error rate based on standard mutual information comparisons is equivalent to the maximum allowable error rate based on perfect mutual information for the eavesdropper. In this case, the above unsafe error rate is in fact not overly conservative. ©2004 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Entangled translucent eavesdropping; Key distribution; Positive operator valued measure; Quantum cryptography; Quantum information processing; Quantum optics","Cryptography; Mathematical operators; Optical beam splitters; Optoelectronic devices; Photons; Polarization; Prisms; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Security systems; Algebraic expressions; All-optical; Closed forms; Entangled translucent eavesdropping; Error rates; Key distribution; Key generations; Mathematical physics; Measurement process; Mutual informations; New designs; New results; Photon polarizations; Polarization rotators; Polarization state; Positive operator valued measure; Projective measurements; Quantitative analysis; Quantum information processing; Receiver errors; Two beams; Wollaston prisms; Quantum cryptography","","","","","","","Ekert A.K., Huttner B., Palma G.M., Peres A., Eavesdropping on Quantum-Cryptographical Systems, Phys.

Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer.

Detailed understanding of the primary photochemical events is important with respect to potential applications in molecular optoelectronic devices. In our studies we apply modern theory, computer simulations, and experimental knowledge to develop new understanding of the photochemical processes and ultimately devise means to control their outcome. We use a combination of quantum theory and quasiclassical calculations to model excitation with laser pulses, excited state dynamics, internal conversion, and relaxation to photoproducts. In rhodopsin, the primary photochemical event involves an 11-cis to 11- trans photoisomerization. Recent time-resolved measurements provide the time-scales for disappearance of the reactant and the appearance of products. We find microscopical details of the internal conversion which are in accordance with the experimental results. This new perspective to the microscopic mechanism reveals the optimization of the electronic structure achieved in evolutionary development in nature. Cis-Stilbene is studied as a model system for which a double resonance laser excitation can be used for influencing the reaction. UV excitation leads to two photoproducts, trans-stilbene and dihydrophenanthrene (DHP). We show that IR excitation can be used to prepare ground sate cis-stilbene in an appropriate vibrational state before electronic excitation. We find that excitation of some modes leads to up to 4.5 times increase in the quantum yield of DHP or up to 4 times increase in trans-stilbene. Because of the shifted absorption spectra of the products, if such system is realized experimentally it can be used as switching bistable device. ©2005 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Control molecular dynamics; Isomerization; Optical switching; Rhodopsin; Stilbene; Vibrational coherence","Coherent light; Dynamics; Electric excitation; Electron transitions; Electronic structure; Isomerization; Isomers; Laser theory; Light sensitive materials; Molecular dynamics; Optical materials; Optical switches; Optoelectronic devices; Photochemical reactions; Photosensitivity; Programming theory; Pulsed laser applications; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Reaction kinetics; Structural optimization; Switching; Control molecular dynamics; Optical switching; Rhodopsin; Stilbene; Vibrational coherence; Laser excitation","","","","","","","Molecular and Biomolecular Electronics, Adv. in Chem.

An interesting result from this phenomenon is that, for a kind of input states, i.e., the coherence-preserving states, coherence of the qubits can be preserved perfectly in quantum memory. In this paper, we propose a feasible scheme to transform an arbitrary unknown input state to the corresponding coherence-preserving state. The transformed state undergoes no decoherence in the noisy memory and, after that, it can be transformed back into the original state with decoherence much reduced. This scheme involves the use of an analogy of the ideas of quantum teleportation. © 1997 by Allerton Press, Inc.","","Computer memory; Decoherence; Input state; Original state; Quanta computers; Quantum memory; Quantum teleportation; Unknown inputs; Quantum computers","","","","","","","Yao A., Proceedings of 34th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, (1993); Schumacher B., Phys.

Interest in quantum computation has since been growing. One of the main difficulties in realizing quantum computation is that decoherence tends to destroy the information in a superposition of states in a quantum computer, making long computations impossible. A further difficulty is that inaccuracies in quantum state transformations throughout the computation accumulate, rendering long computations unreliable. However, these obstacles may not be as formidable as originally believed. For any quantum computation with t gates, we show how to build a polynomial size quantum circuit that tolerates O(1/logc t) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate, for some constant c; the previous bound was O(1/t). We do this by showing that operations can be performed on quantum data encoded by quantum error-correcting codes without decoding this data.","","Coding errors; Error correction; Fault tolerant computer systems; Logic gates; Mathematical transformations; Fault tolerant quantum computation; Quantum circuits; Quantum theory","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE","Proceedings of the 1996 37th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","14 October 1996 through 16 October 1996","Burlington, VT, USA","45714","02725428","","ASFPD","","English","Annu Symp Found Comput Sci Proc","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030393776"

Starting from an initial state in which the normal modes are at a temperature T, and each ion is in a superposition of a ground and an excited state, we calculate the inclusive probability P(t) for the ions to evolve as they would in the absence of coupling, and any final vibrational mode state. An adiabatic approximation exploiting the low vibrational frequencies (108 Itz) vs. the electronic ionic transitions (1014 Hz) is used. An analytic form is found for P(f) at T = 0, and decoherence times are found for all T and N ≈ 1000.

Quantum error correction suggests the possibility of achieving this, but only if the recovery network can suppress more noise than it introduces. A general method of constructing such networks is proposed, which gives a substantial improvement over previous fault tolerant designs. The construction permits quantum error correction to be understood as essentially quantum state synthesis. An approximate analysis implies that algorithms involving very many computational steps on a quantum computer can thus be made possible. © 1997 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Wooters W.K., Zurek W.H., Nature (London)., 299, (1982); Glauber R.J., Frontiers in Quantm Optics, (1986); Shor P.W., Phys.Rev.

Quantum cryptography is an emerging technology for secure key distribution with single-photon transmissions: Heisenburg's uncertainty principle ensures that an adversary can neither successfully tap the key transmissions, nor evade detection (eavesdropping raises the key error rate above a threshold value). We have developed experimental quantum cryptography systems based on the transmission of non-orthogonal single-photon states to generate shared key material over multi-kilometer optical fiber paths and over line-of-sight links. In both cases, key material is built up using the transmission of a single-photon per bit of an initial secret random sequence. A quantum-mechanically random subset of this sequence is identified, becoming the key material after a data reconciliation stage with the sender. In our optical fiber experiment we have performed quantum key distribution over 24-km of underground optical fiber using single-photon interference states, demonstrating that secure, real-time key generation over ""open"" multi-km node-to-node optical fiber communications links is possible. ©2004 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Interferometry; Optical communications; Quantum cryptography","Communication; Cryptography; Error detection; Fiber optics; Fibers; Interferometers; Interferometry; Materials; Optical communication; Optical fibers; Optical materials; Particle beams; Photonics; Photons; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Transmissions; Error Rate (ER); Fiber communications; Fiber paths; Key distributions; Key generation; Optical communications; Photon interference; Photon states; Quantum-key distribution (QKD); Random sequencing; Secure communications; Threshold value(T); Uncertainty principles; Quantum cryptography","","","","","","","Hughes R.J., Et al., Quantum Cryptography, Contemporary Physics, 36, (1995); Bennett C.H., Et al., Quantum Cryptography, Scientific American, 257, 10, (1992); Hughes R.J., Quantum Security is Spookily Certain, Nature, 385, (1997); Atkins D., Et al., The Magic Words are Squeamish Ossifrage, Advances in Cryptology-ASIACRYPT '94 Proceedings, (1995); Wiesner S., Conjugate Coding, SIGACT News, 15, (1983); Bennett C.H., Brassard G., Quantum Cryptography: Public Key Distribution and Coin Tossing, Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computers, Systems and Signal Processing, (1984); Ekert A.K., Quantum Cryptography Based on Bell's Theorem, Phys.

Overall, the findings are an important landmark in the search for macroscopic quantum tunneling of the magnetic moment.","","Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic fields; Magnetic materials; Magnetic moments; Magnetization; Molecules; Phonons; Quantum theory; Thermal effects; manganese; anisotropy; chemical structure; crystal structure; hysteresis; magnet; magnetic field; measurement; molecular interaction; priority journal; quantum mechanics; short survey; Arrhenius law temperature dependence; Magnetic molecules; Molecular magnets; Nanomagnets; Quantitative theory; Quantum computers; Quantum hysteresis; Quantum tunneling; Resonant magnetic tunneling; Magnetic hysteresis","","manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5","","","","","Friedman J.R., Sarachik M.P., Tejada J., Ziolo R., Phys.

Using forcing in this way is a new application of areas of model theory in which propositions and predicates take values in a lattice. Takeuti develops set theory for any universe built on a Boolean algebra generated by commutable projection operators on a Hilbert space, each such universe being a elementary topos of set- valued sheaves on the algebra, which thus is the lattice of truth values for the topos. Since it has a natural numbers object, it thus supports the general forcing method of Scedrov, but the idea of forcing is demonstrated by an example in the simpler context of partially ordered sets. Stout's lamination construction assembles toposes into objects with truth-value lattices that are orthomodular, like the lattice of all projection operators on Hilbert space, and clarifies some difficulties identified by Takeuti in the case where truth values are noncommutable operators. A substantial body of existing sheaf and topos theory thus is potentially relevant to quantum computation, and further work may provide guidance for system development. ©2004 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Decoherence; Forcing; Quantum computation; Sheaf theory; Topos theory","Algebra; Boolean algebra; Computational linguistics; Hilbert spaces; Mathematical operators; Programming theory; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Set theory; Decoherence; Forcing; Quantum computation; Sheaf theory; Topos theory; Quantum computers","","","","","","","Turchette Q.A., Hood C.J., Lange W., Mabuchi H., Kimble H.J., Measurement of conditional phase shifts for quantum logic, Phys.

A large number of enhancements in the nonlinear phase shifts are achieved at the two-photon level using a mechanism where two photons interact with a pair of atoms. The nonlinear phase shift is proportional to NA2 and not NA since the number of pairs of atoms is proportional to NA2, where NA is the number of atoms in the medium. The origin of this effect can be understood from the Feynmen-like diagrams which illustrates the interaction of two photons at two frequencies with a pair of atoms.

The chances for practical implementation, however, are limited by decoherence, in which the effect of an external environment causes random errors in the quantum calculation. To combat this problem, quantum error correction schemes have been proposed, in which a single quantum bit (qubit) is `encoded' as a state of some larger number of qubits, chosen to resist particular types of errors. Most such schemes are vulnerable, however, to errors in the encoding and decoding itself. We examine two such schemes, in which a single qubit is encoded in a state of n qubits while subject to dephasing or to arbitrary isotropic noise. Using both analytical and numerical calculations, we argue that error correction remains beneficial in the presence of weak noise, and that there is an optimal time between error correction steps, determined by the strength of the interaction with the environment and the parameters set by the encoding.","","Algorithms; Computational methods; Encoding (symbols); Error correction; Spurious signal noise; Quantum computers; Random errors; Fault tolerant computer systems","","","","","","","","","","Hwelett Packard Lab Technical Publ Dept","","","","","","","","HLTRE","","English","HP Lab Tech Rep","Report","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030644045"

H. Zurek, Phys. Rev. D 24, 1516 (1981); 26, 1862 (1982)]. This limit, and other simplifying assumptions, have allowed the derivation of several simple results characterizing the onset of environmentally induced superselection; but these results are increasingly often regarded as a complete phenomenological characterization of decoherence in any regime. This is not necessarily the case: the examples presented in this paper counteract this impression by violating several of the simple general rules. This is relevant because decoherence is now beginning to be tested experimentally [C. Monroe et al., Science 272, 1131 (1996); M. Brune et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 4887 (1996)], and one may anticipate that, in at least some of the proposed applications (e.g., quantum computers), only the basic principle of ``monitoring by the environment'' will survive.

Using the tools of transcendental number theory it is demonstrated that quantum Turing machines (QTM) with rational amplitudes are sufficient to define the class of bounded error quantum polynomial time (BQP) introduced by Bernstein and Vazirani [Proc. 25th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computation, 1993, pp. 11-20, SIAM J. Comput., 26 (1997), pp. 1411-1473]. On the other hand, if quantum Turing machines are allowed unrestricted amplitudes (i.e., arbitrary complex amplitudes), then the corresponding BQP class has uncountable cardinality and contains sets of all Turing degrees. In contrast, allowing unrestricted amplitudes does not increase the power of computation for error-free quantum polynomial time (EQP). Moreover, with unrestricted amplitudes, BQP is not equal to EQP. The relationship between quantum complexity classes and classical complexity classes is also investigated. It is shown that when quantum Turing machines are restricted to have transition amplitudes which are algebraic numbers, BQP, EQP, and nondeterministic quantum polynomial time (NQP) are all contained in PP, hence in P#P and PSPACE. A potentially practical issue of designing ""machine independent"" quantum programs is also addressed. A single (""almost universal"") quantum algorithm based on Shor's method for factoring integers is developed which would run correctly on almost all quantum computers, even if the underlying unitary transformations are unknown to the programmer and the device builder.","Quantum complexity classes; Quantum Turing machines","","","","","","","","Baker A., Transcendental Number Theory, (1979); Bennett C.H., Logical reversibility of computation, IBM J.

We demonstrate that the Coulomb repulsion between charge carriers allows one to select the frequency, amplitude, and duration of an electromagnetic pulse so that one electron will transfer from an upper size-quantized level of the valence band to a lower size-quantized level of the conduction band with a probability close to unity. As a result of radiative recombination of the produced electron-hole pair, exactly one photon is emitted (a one-photon wave packet).

Is there a way for Alice to get Bob's trust? Until recently, researchers had believed that the above task can be performed with the help of quantum mechanics. And the security of the quantum scheme lies on the uncertainty principle. Nevertheless, such optimism was recently shattered by Mayers and by us, who found that Alice can always change her mind if she has a quantum computer.

The circuit presented employs a double ``classical'' code, i.e., one for bit flips and one for phase shifts. An implementation of this coding circuit on an ion-trap quantum computer is described that requires 26 laser pulses. Another circuit is presented requiring only 24 laser pulses, making it an efficient protection scheme against arbitrary one-qubit errors.

Sci., 1994, pp. 124-134] suggesting that quantum computers are more powerful than classical probabilistic computers. Following Shor's result that factoring and the extraction of discrete logarithms are both solvable in quantum polynomial time, it is natural to ask whether all of NP can be efficiently solved in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we address this question by proving that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random with probability 1 the class NP cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine (QTM) in time o(2n/2). We also show that relative to a permutation oracle chosen uniformly at random with probability 1 the class NP ∩ co-NP cannot be solved on a QTM in time o(2n/3). The former bound is tight since recent work of Grover [in Proc. 28th Annual ACM Symposium Theory Comput., 1996] shows how to accept the class NP relative to any oracle on a quantum computer in time O(2n/2).","Oracle quantum Turing machines; Quantum polynomial time; Quantum Turing machines","","","","","","Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, CISE, (9310214)","","Babai L., Moran S., Arthur-Merlin games: A randomized proof system, and a hierarchy of complexity classes, J.

The filter bank construction is performed by the Kepplerian temporospatial phase detection strategy which allows for the stroboscopic and synchronous cross sectional quadrature filtering of phase histories in local frequency encoding multichannels with respect to the rotating coordinate frame of reference. The Kepplerian strategy and the associated filter bank construction take place in symplectic affine planes which are immersed as coadjoint orbits of the Heisenberg two-step nilpotent Lie group G into the foliated three-dimensional real projective space P(R × Lie(G)*). Due to the factorization of transvections into affine dilations of opposite ratio, the Heisenberg group G under its natural sub-Riemannian metric acts on the line bundle realizing the projective space P(R × Lie(G)*). Its elliptic non-Euclidean geometry without absolute quadric, associated to the unitary dual G, governs the design of the coils inside the bore of the MRI scanner system. It determines the distributional reproducing kernel of the tracial read-out process of quantum holograms excited and coexisting in the MRI scanner system. Thus the pathway of this paper leads from Keppler's approach to projective geometry to the Heisenberg approach to the sub-Riemannian geometry of quantum physics, and finally to the enormously appealing topic of ensemble quantum computing.","Human brain mapping; Magnetic resonance tomography; Quantum computing; Quantum holography","Brain; Digital filters; Image reconstruction; Magnetic resonance imaging; Radar imaging; Wavelet transforms; Kepplerian temporospatial phase detection strategy; Quantum holography; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Ball Jr. W.S., Pediatric Neuroradiology, (1997); Barkovich A.J., Pediatric Neuroimaging.

The chances for practical implementation, however, are limited by decoherence, in which the effect of an external environment causes random errors in the quantum calculation. To combat this problem, quantum error correction schemes have been proposed, in which a single quantum bit (qubit) is “encoded” as a state of some larger number of qubits, chosen to resist particular types of errors. Most such schemes are vulnerable, however, to errors in the encoding and decoding itself. We examine two such schemes, in which a single qubit is encoded in a state of [Formula Presented] qubits while subject to dephasing or to arbitrary isotropic noise. Using both analytical and numerical calculations, we argue that error correction remains beneficial in the presence of weak noise, and that there is an optimal time between error correction steps, determined by the strength of the interaction with the environment and the parameters set by the encoding. © 1997 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Shor P.W., Proceedings of the 35th Annual Symposium on the Theory of Computer Science, (1994); Plenio M.B., Knight P.L., Phys.

Presented here is an estimate of these rates, for a single trapped ion, based on a quantum perturbation approach where an external thermal energy reservoir is electrically coupled to the ion. The results are for a general system, and it is shown that the relevant parameter in the interpretation of experimentally observed heating rates is the correlation time of the fluctuations.

We adopt the standard physical method of describing systems which are interwound with their environment by `density matrices', and within this framework define a model of decoherence in quantum computation. Our results show that the computational power of decohered quantum computers depends strongly on the amount of parallelism in the computation. We first present a simulation of decohered sequential quantum computers, on a classical probabilistic Turing machine, and prove that the expected slowdown of this simulation is polynomial in time and space of the quantum computation, for any non zero decoherence rate. Similar results hold for Quantum computers that are allowed to operate on logarithmic number of qubits at a time. For decohered quantum circuits (with local gates), the situation is more subtle and depends on the decoherence rate, η. We find that our simulation is efficient for circuits with decoherence rate η higher than some constant η1, but exponential for a general (random) circuit subjected to decoherence rate lower than some constant η2. The transition from exponential cost to polynomial cost happens in a short range of decoherence rates. We use computer experiments to exhibit the phase transitions in various quantum circuits.","","Computer simulation; Logic gates; Polynomials; Probability; Sequential machines; Turing machines; Decohered quantum computers; Decoherence rate; Quantum theory","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE","Proceedings of the 1996 37th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","14 October 1996 through 16 October 1996","Burlington, VT, USA","45714","02725428","","ASFPD","","English","Annu Symp Found Comput Sci Proc","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030421410"

These tests include local hidden variables theories, pre- and post-selective quantum mechanics, QND measurements, complementarity, and tests of mechanics itself against, e.g. the so-called causal communication constraint. We show how to produce nonlocal entangled states of multiple cavity fields. We first discuss two-cavity entanglement, namely the generation of the Bell basis states for this system, when there is at most one photon in either of the cavities. We then discuss a straightforward generalization to similar N-cavity states. These states can be produced by sending appropriately prepared atoms through the cavities. As applications we briefly review a proposal to test quantum mechanics against the causal communication constraint using the two-cavity state and a test of pre- and post-selective quantum mechanics using a three-cavity state and the close connection of the latter to the consistent histories interpretation. Finally we point out the relation between these schemes and the schemes suggested for quantum computing, teleportation and quantum copying. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","PSC-CUNY; Office of Naval Research, ONR","This research was supported by the Office of Naval Research and by a grant from PSC-CUNY.

It is found that a large exchange interaction between the electrons favors faster switching but also makes the timing of the read cycle more critical. Additionally, there exists an optimal input signal energy to achieve complete switching. Only for this optimal signal energy does the inverter yield an unambiguous, logically definite state. An experimental strategy for realizing circuits based on such gates in self-assembled arrays of quantum dots is briefly discussed. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.","Quantum computing; Quantum dots; Single electronics","Antiferromagnetism; Electron energy levels; Logic gates; Quantum theory; Optimal signal energy; Single electronics; Semiconductor quantum dots","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (ECS9308814); Army Research Office, ARO, (DAAH04-95-1-0586)","of Chemical Engineering, University of Notre Dame.

The application of such processes for preventing decoherence, for example in quantum computers, was suggested. We shall show that in the situation when the quantum jump is reversible it supplies no information about the initial state additional to the information known beforehand. Therefore the reversibility of this type does not contradict the general statement of quantum measurement theory: a measurement cannot be reversed. As a consequence of this, the coherence of a state (say, in a quantum computer) cannot be restored after it is destroyed by dissipative processes having the character of a measurement.","","Measurement theory; Qubits; Decoherence; Dissipative process; Initial state; Quantum jumps; Quantum measurement theories; Quantum theory","","","","","DeutscheF orschungsgemeinschaft","sity during the workshop of the Ulm and Innsbruck quantum-opticsg roups.

It seems probable that the brain is an EQC, and that electronic EQC dissimilar to the brain can also be constructed; a speculative design in this regard is described, called QELA (Quantum Evolving Logic Array), involving Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices interfacing with re-configurable Field Programmable Logic Arrays. EQC has interesting implications for a quantum panpsychic view of consciousness: it provides an explanation of why, if everything is conscious to some extent, the human brain is so much more conscious than most other systems. The explanation is that, via EQC, the brain is able to maintain significant quantum randomness (""raw awareness"") in a way that is correlated with its structure and behavior. Only EQC provides this kind of correlation, because only EQC allows uncollapsed quantum systems to interact significantly with the wave-function-collapsed, classical everyday world. In many-worlds-terms, EQC allows systems with a broad span over the range of possible universes to interact significantly with systems existing in narrow regions of universe-space.","","","","","","","","","Bateson G., Mind and Nature, (1980); Chaitin G., Algorithmic Information Theory, (1988); Clarke C.J.S., Coupled molecular oscillators do not admit true bose condensations, Journal of Physics A, (1994); Del Giudice E., Doglia S., Milani M., Vitiello G., Solitons and coherent electric waves in a quantum field theoretical approach, Modern Bioelectrochemistry, (1986); Deutsch D., Quantum turing machines, Proc.

The concept and methods of incursion and hyperincursion are firstly applied to the Fractal Machine, a hyperincursive cellular automaton with sequential computations with exclusive OR, where time plays a central role. Simulations will show the generation of fractal patterns. The computation is incursive, for inclusive recursion, in the sense that an automaton is computed at the future time t+1 as a function of its neighbour automata at the present and/or past time steps but also at the future time t+1. The hyperincursion is an incursion when several values can be generated at each time step. External incursive inputs cannot be transformed to recursion. (This is really an example of the Final Cause of Aristotle.) But internal incursive inputs defined at the future time can be transformed to recursive inputs by self-reference. A particular case of self-reference with the Fractal Machine shows a non deterministic hyper-incursive field. Interference of particles in the Fractal Machine gives rise to fractal patterns which follow Huygens Principle of Secondary Sources. The superimposition of states is similar to Deutsch's quantum computing principle. This is also related to digital cellular automata obtained from diffusion and wave finite difference equations. Zuse proposed to represent physical systems by a computing space based on such a digitalization of differential equations. I show that the digital wave equation exhibits waves by digital particles with interference effects and uncertainty.","","Computational methods; Computer simulation; Differential equations; Finite difference method; Fractals; Mathematical models; Quantum theory; Wave equations; Huygens principle of secondary scores; Hyperincursive cellular automaton; Automata theory","","","","","","","Aczel P., Lectures in Nonwellfounded Sets, (1987); Barwise J., Moss L., Hypersets, Mathematical Intelligencer, 13, 4, pp. 31-41, (1991); Bohm D., Wholeness and the Implicate Order, La Plénitude de L'univers, (1987); Bowden K., On general physical systems theories, Int.

The filter bank construction is performed by the Kepplerian temporospatial phase detection strategy which allows for the stroboscopic and synchronous cross sectional quadrature filtering of phase histories in local frequency encoding multichannels with respect to the rotating coordinate frame of reference. The Kepplerian strategy and the associated filter bank construction take place in symplectic affine planes which are immersed as coadjoint orbits of the Heisenberg two-step nilpotent Lie group G into the foliated three-dimensional real projective space P(R x Lie(G)*). Due to the factorization of transvections into affine dilations of opposite ratio, the Heisenberg group G under its natural sub-Riemannian metric acts on the line bundle realizing the projective space P(R x Lie(G)*). Its elliptic non-Euclidean geometry without absolute quadric, associated to the unitary dual Ĝ, governs the design of the coils inside the bore of the MRI scanner system. It determines the distributional reproducing kernel of the tracial read-out process of quantum holograms excited and coexisting in the MRI scanner system. Thus the pathway of this paper leads from Keppler's approach to projective geometry to the Heisenberg approach to the sub-Riemannian geometry of quantum physics, and finally to the enormously appealing topic of ensemble quantum computing.","Harmonic analysis on the Heisenberg group; Quantum holography; Radiodiagnostics","","","","","","","","Ball W.S.

A quantum robot is a mobile quantum system that includes an on-board quantum computer and needed ancillary systems. Quantum robots carry out tasks whose goals include specified changes in the state of the environment, or carrying out measurements on the environment. Each task is a sequence of alternating computation and action phases. Computation phase activites include determination of the action to be carried out in the next phase, and recording of information on neighborhood environmental system states. Action phase activities include motion of the quantum robot and changes in the neighborhood environment system states. Models of quantum robots and their interactions with environments are described using discrete space and time. A unitary step operator [Formula Presented] that gives the single time step dynamics is associated with each task. [Formula Presented] is a sum of action phase and computation phase step operators. Conditions that [Formula Presented] and [Formula Presented] should satisfy are given along with a description of the evolution as a sum over paths of completed phase input and output states. A simple example of a task—carrying out a measurement on a very simple environment—is analyzed in detail. A decision tree for the task is presented and discussed in terms of the sums over phase paths. It is seen that no definite times or durations are associated with the phase steps in the tree, and that the tree describes the successive phase steps in each path in the sum over phase paths. © 1998 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Vedral V., Barenco A., Ekert A., Phys.

The initial state of each computer in the ensemble is known but not pure. Methods for obtaining effective pure input states by a series of manipulations have been described by Gershenfeld and Chuang (logical labeling) [Science 275, 350 (1997)] and Cory et al. (spatial averaging) [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94, 1634 (1997)] for the case of quantum computation with nuclear magnetic resonance. We give a different technique called temporal averaging. This method is based on classical randomization, requires no ancilla quantum bits, and can be implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance without using gradient fields. We introduce several temporal averaging algorithms suitable for both high-temperature and low-temperature bulk quantum computing and analyze the signal-to-noise behavior of each. Most of these algorithms require only a constant multiple of the number of experiments needed by the other methods for creating effective pure states. © 1998 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Gershenfeld N., Chuang I., Lloyd S., Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Physics and Computation, (1996); Gershenfeld N.A., Chuang I.L., Science, 275, (1997); Cory D.G., Fahmy A.F., Havel T.F., Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Physics and Computation, pp. 87-91; Cory D.G., Fahmy A.F., Havel T.F., Proc.

Elliptical traps can confine large numbers of ions in the Lamb-Dicke regime due to a hitherto unrecognized mechanism unique to one-dimensional Coulomb crystals, implicit in the theories of Dubin and Schiffer. This follows from a linear crystal stability condition, which uniquely relates the crystal size to ellipticity, and a micromotion relation, which reveals a 1/5-root dependence on the number of trapped ions. Elliptical traps offer several advantages over linear traps in the Cirac-Zoller model of quantum computing, both for initial tests and as a potential method of creating a full-scale quantum computer. Numerical solutions of a one-electrode structure show that microscopic elliptical traps, each containing [Formula Presented] ions, can be constructed at a density of 100 traps/[Formula Presented] making possible arrays containing [Formula Presented] ions in the Lamb-Dicke regime for precision spectroscopy or quantum computation. © 1998 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Paul W., Rev.

Broad and important applications must be found to justify construction of a quantum computer; I review some of the known quantum algorithms and consider the prospects for finding new ones. Quantum computers are notoriously susceptible to making errors; I discuss recently developed fault-tolerant procedures that enable a quantum computer with noisy gates to perform reliably. Quantum computing hardware is still in its infancy; I comment on the specifications that should be met by future hardware. Over the past few years, work on quantum computation has erected a new classification of computational complexity, has generated profound insights into the nature of decoherence, and has stimulated the formulation of new techniques in high-precision experimental physics. A broad interdisciplinary effort will be needed if quantum computers are to fulfil their destiny as the world's fastest computing devices.

We make the assumption that all quantum bits (qubits) interact with the same environment rather than the assumption of separate environments for different qubits. It is found that the qubits decohere collectively. For some kinds of entangled input states, no decoherence occurs at all in the memory, even if the qubits are interacting with the environment. Based on this phenomenon, a scheme is proposed for reducing the collective decoherence. We also discuss possible implications of this decoherence model for quantum measurements. © 1998 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","DiVincenzo D.P., Science, 270, (1995); Bennett C.H., Phys.

K1A 0R6, Canada","The multitude and diversity of functions performed by the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells poses a major scientific puzzle. Microtubules, which are the main components of the cytoskeleton, are engaged in such important activities as material transport, cell motility, cell division, signal transduction and possibly information processing within axons of nerve cells. The latter aspect has been recently brought to the forefront of consciousness studies by R. Penrose and S. Hameroff. In this paper we discuss the potential of microtubules as information processing units from a physical standpoint. In particular, since electric dipoles are a characteristic property of protein molecules, and as such may undergo various ordering phase transitions, it can be expected that microtubules support the existence of various ferroelectrically ordered states. It is also argued that the piezoelectric effect may link electric and elastic properties of a dielectric polymer system and hence explain a number of experimental observations both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, preliminary results are shown of recent quantum mechanical calculations for the electrical conduction properties of microtubule protofilaments which support the assertion that the latter may function under certain conditions very much like semiconducting devices. Indirect evidence links the cytoskeleton with information processing and cognitive function. We discuss some plausible ways in which axonal microtubules can be involved in the functioning of the brain. Finally, we present a hierarchy of energy values for a number of physical and chemical interactions of interest and discuss their relative importance.","Dielectric polarization; Electrical conduction; Microtubules; Neurotransmitter release; Quantum computing; Signal propagation","","","","","","","","Amos L., Trends Cell Biol., 5, (1995); Athenstaedt H., Ann.

We show several results for the probabilistic quantum class BQP. BQP is low for PP, i.e., PPBQP=PP. There exists a relativized world where P=BQP and the polynomial-time hierarchy is infinite. There exists a relativized world where BQP does not have complete sets. There exists a relativized world where P=BQP but P≠UP∩coUP and one-way functions exist. This gives a relativized answer to an open question of Simon. © 1998 IEEE.","","Computational complexity; Polynomial approximation; Complete sets; Counting complexity; One-way functions; Polynomial-time hierarchy; Quantum computers","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CCR 92-53582); National Science Foundation, NSF","Funding text 1: Supported in part by NSF grant CCR 92-53582.

However, we, and independently Mayers, showed that all proposed quantum bit commitment schemes are, in principle, insecure because the sender, Alice, can almost always cheat successfully by using an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type of attack and delaying her measurements. One might wonder if secure quantum bit commitment protocols exist at all. We answer this question by showing that the same type of attack by Alice will, in principle, break any bit commitment scheme. The cheating strategy generally requires a quantum computer. We emphasize the generality of this ""no-go theorem"": Unconditionally secure bit commitment schemes based on quantum mechanics-fully quantum, classical or quantum but with measurements-are all ruled out by this result. Since bit commitment is a useful primitive for building up more sophisticated protocols such as zero-knowledge proofs, our results cast very serious doubt on the security of quantum cryptography in the so-called ""post-cold-war"" applications. We also show that ideal quantum coin tossing is impossible because of the EPR attack. This no-go theorem for ideal quantum coin tossing may help to shed some lights on the possibility of non-ideal protocols. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Only on a sufficiently small time-scale and for a coherent initial state, also the ensemble exhibits some Zenon effect. In this case, ironically, actual measurements are not required: a closed single composite system can emulate this behavior. Such a kind of quantum parallelism underlies also recent proposals for quantum computation. © EDP Sciences Springer-Verlag 1998.","","Quantum chemistry; Actual measurements; Exclusive measurements; Initial state; Quantum parallelism; Quantum trajectories; Simple system; Single composites; Small time scale; Specific class; Quantum computers","","","","","","","Gagen M.J., Wiseman H.M., Milburn G.J., Phys.

The necessary manipulation of the quantum states can be controlled by applied gate voltages. In addition, the state of the system has to be read out. Here we suggest to measure the quantum state by coupling a single-electron transistor to the (Formula presented)-bit. As long as no transport voltage is applied, the transistor influences the quantum dynamics of the (Formula presented)-bit only weakly. We have analyzed the time evolution of the density matrix of the transistor and (Formula presented)-bit when a voltage is turned on. For values of the capacitances and temperatures which can be realized by modern nanotechniques, the process constitutes a quantum measurement process. © 1998 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Shnirman A., Schon G., Hermon Z., Phys.

While she does not want to reveal it to Bob at this moment, she would like to convince Bob that she is committed to this particular decision and that she cannot change it at a later time. Is there a way for Alice to get Bob's trust? Until recently, researchers had believed that the above task can be performed with the help of quantum mechanics. And the security of the quantum scheme lies on the uncertainty principle. Nevertheless, such optimism was recently shattered by Mayers and by us, who found that Alice can always change her mind if she has a quantum computer. Here, we survey this dramatic development and its implications on the security of other quantum cryptographic schemes.","","","","","","","","","Schneier B., Applied Cryptography 2nd Ed., (1996); Pomerance C., Notices Am.

In this paper we show that under the assumption that the sender is not able to perform generalized measurements involving more than n qubits coherently (n-coherent measurements) then quantum bit commitment is possible. A commitment scheme is δ-binding if for each execution there is an (equation present)∈{0,1} that cannot be unveiled with probability of success better than δ. Our bit commitment scheme requires the transmission of N qubits and is δ-binding, for any δ > 0, if the committer can only carry outn-coherent measurements for some n ∃ Ω(N). For some α > 0, the scheme is 2−αN-binding against n-coherent measurements for some n ∃ Ω(√N). The security against malicious receivers is unconditional. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.","","Bins; Cryptography; Quantum cryptography; Bit commitment; Coherent measurement; Commitment scheme;

We show that generically such models give rise to a wave function satisfying a Schrödinger equation in the continuum limit, in any number of dimensions. There is a simple mathematical relationship between the mass of the Schrödinger particle and the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix describing the local evolution of the model. Second quantized versions of these unitary models can be defined, describing in the continuum limit the evolution of a nonrelativistic quantum many-body theory. An arbitrary potential is easily incorporated into these systems. The models we describe fall in the class of quantum lattice-gas automata and can be implemented on a quantum computer with a speedup exponential in the number of particles in the system. This gives an efficient algorithm for simulating general nonrelativistic interacting quantum many-body systems on a quantum computer. © 1998 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Frisch U., Hasslacher B., Pomeau Y., Phys.

Therefore, since the physical world is fundamentally quantum mechanical, the foundations of information theory and computer science should be sought in quantum physics. In fact, quantum information has weird properties that contrast sharply with the familiar properties of classical information. A quantum computer - a new type of machine that exploits the quantum properties of information - could perform certain types of calculations far more efficiently than any foreseeable classical computer. To build a functional quantum computer will be an enormous technical challenge. New methods for quantum error correction are being developed that can help to prevent a quantum computer from crashing.","","Computation theory; Computer systems; Error correction; Information theory; Quantum theory; Quantum computers; Quantum computing; Quantum error correction; Quantum information; Information technology","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Comp Soc","IEEE","Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE Aerospace Conference.

This paper is concerned instead with the use of nonlocal effects to construct the quantum gates themselves. A nonlocal interaction in which pairs of atoms exchange two photons is expected to produce a large nonlinear phase shift. An interesting feature of this effect is that energy is not conserved at the location of an individual atom but it is conserved overall. The preliminary results from a series of experiments in a sodium vapor cell are in apparent agreement with the predictions of the theory. These nonlinear phase shifts can be used to construct quantum logic gates, such as a Controlled-NOT.","","","","","","","","","Feynman R.P., Optics News, 11, (1985); Deutsch D., Proc. R. Soc. Lond.

But noise, loss of coherence, and manufacturing problems make constructing large-scale quantum computers difficult. Although ion traps and optical cavities offer promising experimental approaches, no quantum algorithm has yet been implemented with these systems. Here we report the experimental realization of a quantum algorithm using a bulk nuclear magnetic resonance technique, in which the nuclear spins act as 'quantum bits'. The nuclear spins are particularly suited to this role because of their natural isolation from the environment.

This model is based on proposed transient alignment of adjacent ethylenes of phospholipid diacyls in the neural membrane. Influx of anions and cations into the cytosol at ∼ 108 ions/s at ligand-gated channels hypothetically establishes the conditions for charge transfer through adjacent diacyl ethylenes. It is suggested that this process produces interactions between phospholipid potential energy hypersurfaces. These interactions operating in many-dimensional (Hubert) space represent a form of massively parallel computation. Basic theoretical principles of quantum computing relevant to the present model are briefly discussed. A preliminary computational model of charge transfer through stacked ethylenes is then presented. In this model molecules were aligned with planes parallel and perpendicular. Singly charged counterions were positioned at the ends of the stacks and ab initio Hartree-Fock calculations at the 6-31 + G(d, p) level were carried out. Degree of charge transfer between counterions was monitored by Mulliken population analysis from which atomic charges and dipole moments were calculated. The results of these calculations are interpreted in a larger neurobiological context. Models are proposed which relate the charge-transfer process to ion channel dynamics (open/closed), changes in membrane potential, and macroscopic memory systems. A hypothetical feedback circuitry which could regulate membrane potential and prevent recurrent excitation or hyperpolarization is described. Potential tests of the model utilizing photoinduced charge transfer through a polyenic molecular wire are proposed. It is concluded that this research could lead to a better understanding of computational processes in neurophysiology and cognition. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Computational modeling; Hilbert space; Neuron; Quantum computer","","","","","","","","Wallace R., Toward a Science of Consciousness: The First Tucson Discussions and Debates, (1996); Kinnunen P., Virtanen J., Modern Bioelectrochemistry, (1986); Kinnunen P., Chem.

The Penrose-Hameroff model (orchestrated objective reduction: 'Orch OR') suggests that quantum superposition and a form of quantum computation occur in microtubules - cylindrical protein lattices of the cell cytoskeleton within the brain's neurons. Microtubules couple to and regulate neural-level synaptic functions, and they may be ideal quantum computers because of dynamical lattice structure, quantum-level subunit states and intermittent isolation from environmental interactions. In addition to its biological setting, the Orch OR proposal differs in an essential way from technologically envisioned quantum computers in which collapse, or reduction to classical output states, is caused by environmental decoherence (hence introducing randomness). In the Orch OR proposal, reduction of microtubule quantum superposition to classical output states occurs by an objective factor - Roger Penrose's quantum gravity threshold stemming from instability in Planck-scale separations (superpositions) in spacetime geometry. Output states following Penrose's objective reduction are neither totally deterministic nor random, but influenced by a non-computable factor ingrained in fundamental spacetime. Taking a modern panpsychist view in which protoconscious experience and Platonic values are embedded in Planck-scale spin networks, the Orch OR model portrays consciousness as brain activities linked to fundamental ripples in spacetime geometry.","Brain; Consciousness; Microtubules; Objective reduction; Orchestrated objective reduction (Orch OR); Quantum computation","","","","","","","","Andreu J.M., Hydrophobic interaction of tubulin, Ann.

The first is a new technique using electron shelving to measure the populations of the Zeeman sublevels of the ground state, in an ion for which no cycling transition exists from any of these sublevels. The second technique is laser cooling to the vibrational ground state, without the need for a trap operating in the Lamb-Dicke limit. This requires sideband cooling in a sub-recoil regime.

These problems include factoring integers and certain physics simulations. Practical quantum computation requires overcoming the problems of environmental noise and operational errors, problems which appear to be much more severe than in classical computation, due to the inherent fragility of quantum superpositions involving many degrees of freedom. Here we show that arbitrarily accurate quantum computations are possible provided that the error per operation is below a threshold value.

In the general case, we introduce two pairs of the phase operators associated with the phase angles in 3D picture of the Poincare sphere for the polarization Stokes parameters of light. The special eight-port polarization interferometer (polarimeter) is presented for simultaneous homodyne detection of both the Stokes parameters of light and the optical phases difference, and also of their fluctuations. It is shown that a spatio-inhomogeneous optical fiber being placed in the polarization interferometer can be used for generation and detection of the polarization-squeezed phase (PSP) states of light. The analysis of the arising instabilities for two (or four) orthogonally polarized modes in a tunnel-coupled optical fiber (TCOF) has been carried out. New effects of polarization switching are obtained, and we discuss the problem of both the coding of information, and the principles of polarization quantum logical elements in the quantum computing problem. The optical schemes to realize the quantum AND (NOT-AND), OR (NOT-OR) operations, and controlled-NOT gates with quantum non-demolition filtering of the signal, are proposed.

The noise level which can be tolerated in a fault-tolerant method is therefore a function of the computational resources available, especially the size of computer and degree of parallelism. I present an analysis of error correction with block codes, made fault-tolerant through the use of prepared ancilla blocks. The preparation and verification of the ancillas is described in detail. It is shown that the ancillas need only be verified against a small set of errors. This, combined with previously known advantages, makes this 'ancilla factory' the best method to apply error correction, whether in concatenated or block coding. I then consider the resources required to achieve 2 · 1010 computational steps reliably in a computer of 2150 logical qubits, finding that the simplest [[n, 1, d]] block codes can tolerate more noise with smaller overheads than the 7L-bit concatenated code. The scaling is such that block codes remain the better choice for all computations one is likely to contemplate.","","","","","","","","","Calderbank A.R., Shor P.W., Phys. Rev.

This difference leads to a greater efficiency of quantum computation over its classical counterpart. In this review we explain the basic principles of quantum computation, including the construction of basic gates, and networks. We illustrate the power of quantum algorithms using the simple problem of Deutsch, and explain, again in very simple terms, the well known algorithm of Shor for factorisation of large numbers into primes. We then describe physical implementations of quantum computers, focusing on one in particular, the linear ion trap realization. We explain that the main obstacle to building an actual quantum computer is the problem of decoherence, which we show may be circumvented using the methods of quantum error correction. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Three years later Deutsch described a quantum- mechanical Turing machine, showing that quantum computers could indeed be constructed. Since then there has been extensive research in this field, but although the theory is fairly well understood, actually building a quantum computer has proved extremely difficult. Only two methods have been used to demonstrate quantum logic gates: ion traps and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). NMR quantum computers have recently been used to solve a simple quantum algorithm - the two-bit Deutsch problem. Here we show experimentally that such a computer can be used to implement a non-trivial fast quantum search algorithm initially developed by Grover, which can be conducted faster than a comparable search on a classical computer.","","algorithm; article; computer system; priority journal; quantum mechanics","","","","","","","","J.A.

This review aims to summarize not just quantum computing, but the whole subject of quantum information theory. Information can be identified as the most general thing which must propagate from a cause to an effect. It therefore has a fundamentally important role in the science of physics. However, the mathematical treatment of information, especially information processing, is quite recent, dating from the mid-20th century. This has meant that the full significance of information as a basic concept in physics is only now being discovered. This is especially true in quantum mechanics. The theory of quantum information and computing puts this significance on a firm footing, and has led to some profound and exciting new insights into the natural world. Among these are the use of quantum states to permit the secure transmission of classical information (quantum cryptography), the use of quantum entanglement to permit reliable transmission of quantum states (teleportation), the possibility of preserving quantum coherence in the presence of irreversible noise processes (quantum error correction), and the use of controlled quantum evolution for efficient computation (quantum computation). The common theme of all these insights is the use of quantum entanglement as a computational resource. It turns out that information theory and quantum mechanics fit together very well. In order to explain their relationship, this review begins with an introduction to classical information theory and computer science, including Shannon's theorem, error correcting codes, Turing machines and computational complexity. The principles of quantum mechanics are then outlined, and the Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) experiment described. The EPR-Bell correlations, and quantum entanglement in general, form the essential new ingredient which distinguishes quantum from classical information theory and, arguably, quantum from classical physics. Basic quantum information ideas are next outlined, including qubits and data compression, quantum gates, the 'no cloning' property and teleportation. Quantum cryptography is briefly sketched. The universal quantum computer (QC) is described, based on the Church-Turing principle and a network model of computation. Algorithms for such a computer are discussed, especially those for finding the period of a function, and searching a random list. Such algorithms prove that a QC of sufficiently precise construction is not only fundamentally different from any computer which can only manipulate classical information, but can compute a small class of functions with greater efficiency. This implies that some important computational tasks are impossible for any device apart from a QC. To build a universal QC is well beyond the abilities of current technology. However, the principles of quantum information physics can be tested on smaller devices. The current experimental situation is reviewed, with emphasis on the linear ion trap, high-Q optical cavities, and nuclear magnetic resonance methods. These allow coherent control in a Hilbert space of eight dimensions (three qubits) and should be extendable up to a thousand or more dimensions (10 qubits). Among other things, these systems will allow the feasibility of quantum computing to be assessed. In fact such experiments are so difficult that it seemed likely until recently that a practically useful QC (requiring, say, 1000 qubits) was actually ruled out by considerations of experimental imprecision and the unavoidable coupling between any system and its environment. However, a further fundamental part of quantum information physics provides a solution to this impasse. This is quantum error correction (QEC). An introduction to QEC is provided. The evolution of the QC is restricted to a carefully chosen subspace of its Hilbert space. Errors are almost certain to cause a departure from this subspace. QEC provides a means to detect and undo such departures without upsetting the quantum computation. This achieves the apparently impossible, since the computation preserves quantum coherence even though during its course all the qubits in the computer will have relaxed spontaneously many times. The review concludes with an outline of the main features of quantum information physics and avenues for future research. © 1998 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Abrams D.S., Lloyd S., Simulation of many-body Fermi systems on a universal quantum computer, Phys.

Sci. and Eng., Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","This paper studies the computational power of quantum computers to explore as to whether they can recognize properties which are in nondeterministic polynomial-time class (NP) and beyond. To study the computational power, we use the Feynman's path integral (FPI) formulation of quantum mechanics. From a computational point of view the Feynman's path integral computes a quantum dynamical analogue of the k-ary relation computed by an Alternating Turing machine (ATM) using AND-OR Parallelism. Hence, if we can find a suitable mapping function between an instance of a mathematical problem and the corresponding interference problem, using suitable potential functions for which FPI can be integrated exactly, the computational power of a quantum computer can be bounded to that of an alternating Turing machine that can solve problems in NP (e.g, factorization problem) and in polynomial space. Unfortunately, FPI is exactly integrable only for a few problems (e.g., the harmonic oscillator) involving quadratic potentials; otherwise, they may be only approximately computable or noncomputable. This means we cannot in general solve all quantum dynamical problems exactly except for those special cases of quadratic potentials, e.g., harmonic oscillator. Since there is a one to one correspondence between the quantum mechanical problems that can be analytically solved and the path integrals that can be exactly evaluated, we can say that the noncomputability of FPI implies quantum unsolvability. This is the analogue of classical unsolvability. The Feynman's path graph can be considered as a semantic parse graph for the quantum mechanical sentence. It provides a semantic valuation function of the terminal sentence based on probability amplitudes to disambiguate a given quantum description and obtain an interpretation in a linear time. In Feynman's path integral, the kernels are partially ordered over time (different alternate paths acting concurrently at the same time) and multiplied. The semantic valuation is computable only if the FPI is computable. Thus both the expressive power and complexity aspects quantum computing are mirrored by the exact and efficient integrability of FPI.","Alternating Turing Machine (ATM); Complexity; Feynman Path Integral (FPI); Integrability; Partition Function (PF); Pfaffian; Quantum Computation; Transitive Closure","","","","","","","","Aho A.V., Hopcroft J., Ulllman J.D., The Design and Analysis Algorithms, (1975); Albert D.Z., Physics Lett., 98 A, pp. 249-252, (1983); Blank J., Exner P., Havlicek M., Hubert Space Operators in Quantum Physics, (1994); Belinfante F.J., Measurements and Time Reversal in Objective Quantum Theory, (1975); Beltrametti E.G., Cassinelli G.G., The Logic of Quantum Mechanics, Encyclopedia of Mathematics, 15, (1981); Bernstein E., Vazirani U., Quantum complexity theory, Proc. 25th ACM Theory of Computing, (1994); Berthiaume A., Brassard G., G.

In each of these developments, Rolf Landauer has played a crucial role in nudging us, and other workers in the field, into asking the right questions, some of which we have been lucky enough to answer. A general overview of the key ideas of quantum error correction is given. We discuss how quantum entanglement is the key to protecting quantum states from decoherence in a manner which, in a theoretical sense, is as effective as the protection of digital data from bit noise. We also discuss five general criteria which must be satisfied to implement a quantum computer in the laboratory, and we illustrate the application of these criteria by discussing our ideas for creating a quantum computer out of the spin states of coupled quantum dots. © 1998 Academic Press Limited.","Entanglement; Quantum computation; Quantum dots","Calculations; Computers; Data processing; Error correction; Green's function; Semiconductor quantum dots; Quantum computation; Quantum entanglement; Quantum error correction; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Landauer R., Is quantum-mechanically coherent computation useful?, Proc.

The error generators are identified with the generators of a Lie algebra. This allows for a comprehensive description which includes as a special case the frequently assumed spin-boson model. A generic condition is presented for errorless quantum computation: decoherence-free subspaces are spanned by those states which are annihilated by all the generators. It is shown that these subspaces are stable to perturbations and, moreover, that universal quantum computation is possible within them. © 1998 American Physical Society.","","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, MPS, (9616615)","","Shor P.W., Proceedings of the 35Th Annual Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science, (1994); Grover L.K., Phys.

The analogy can be pushed a long way, only to reach its limits when we try to represent multiparticle, or nonlocal, entanglement. This demonstrates that the latter is of exclusive quantum nature. On the other hand, the entanglement of different degrees of freedom of the same particle might be considered classical. The classical analog cannot replace Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen type experiments, nor can it be used to build a quantum computer. Nevertheless, it does provide a reliable guide to the intuition and a tool for visualizing abstract concepts in low-dimensional Hilbert spaces.","","","","","","","Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen, KNAW","I have had many lively and stimulating discussions on this subject with many people.

Rolf Landauer was perhaps the first to stress the strong analogy between these two concepts. His early queries have regained pertinence with the recent efforts to developed realizable models of quantum computers. In this context the irreversibility of quantum measurement appears in conflict with the requirement of reversibility of the overall computation associated with the unitary dynamics of quantum evolution. The latter in turn is responsible for the features of superposition and entanglement which make some quantum algorithms superior to classical ones for the same task in speed and resource demand. In this article we advocate an approach to this question which relies on a model of computation designed to enforce the analogy between the two concepts instead of demarcating them as it has been the case so far. The model is introduced as a symmetrization of the classical Turing machine model and is then carried on to quantum mechanics, first as a an abstract local interaction scheme (symbolic measurement) and finally in a nonlocal noninteractive implementation based on Aharonov-Bohm potentials and modular variables. It is suggested that this implementation leads to the most ubiquitous of quantum algorithms: the Discrete Fourier Transform. © 1998 Academic Press Limited.","","Algorithms; Calculations; Computers; Fourier transforms; Models; Discrete Fourier transforms; Quantum algorithms; Quantum computing; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Berthiaume A., Lectures on Quantum Computation, (1996); Braginsky V.B., Kahlili F.Ya., Quantum Measurement, (1992); Busch P., Lahti P.J., The Quantum Theory of Measurement, Lecture Notes in Physics, 2, (1991); Deutsch D., Proc.

Lauritsen Laboratory of High Energy Physics, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, United States","The new field of quantum error correction has developed spectacularly since its origin less than two years ago. Encoded quantum information can be protected from errors that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the environment. Recovery from errors can work effectively even if occasional mistakes occur during the recovery procedure. Furthermore, encoded quantum information can be processed without serious propagation of errors. Hence, an arbitrarily long quantum computation can be performed reliably, provided that the average probability of error per quantum gate is less than a certain critical value, the accuracy threshold. A quantum computer storing about 106 qubits, with a probability of error per quantum gate of order 10G, would be a formidable factoring engine. Even a smaller less-accurate quantum computer would be able to perform many useful tasks. This paper is based on a talk presented at the ITP Conference on Quantum Coherence and Decoherence, 15-18 December 1996. © 1998 The Royal Society.","Fault-tolerant computation; Quantum leaks; Reliable quantum computers","","","","","","","","Aharonov D., Ben-Or M., Fault Tolerant Quantum Computation with Constant Error.

The need for a universally valid theory such as quantum mechanics to describe to some extent its own validation is noted. This includes quantum mechanical descriptions of systems that do theoretical calculations (i.e. quantum computers) and systems that perform experiments. Quantum robots interacting with an environment are a small first step in this direction. Quantum robots are described here as mobile quantum systems with on-board quantum computers that interact with environments. Included are discussions on the carrying out of tasks and the division of tasks into computation and action phases. Specific models based on quantum Turing machines are described. Differences and similarities between quantum robots plus environments and quantum computers are discussed.","Quantum computers; Quantum robots","Algorithms; Calculations; Computers; Error correction; Robots; Quantum computer; Quantum computing; Quantum robot; Quantum theory","","","","","Nuclear Physics Division, (W-31-109-ENG-38); University of Chicago as Operator of Argonne National Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE","Acknowledgements— It is a pleasure to dedicate this work to Rolf Landauer on the occasion of his seventieth birthday.

This emulation is made possible by two facts. The first is that the spin active nuclei in each molecule of a liquid sample are largely isolated from the spins in all other molecules, so that each molecule is effectively an independent quantum computer. The second is the existence of a manifold of statistical spin states, called pseudo-pure states, whose transformation properties are identical to those of true pure states. These facts enable us to operate on coherent superpositions over the spins in each molecule using full quantum parallelism, and to combine the results into deterministic macroscopic observables via thermodynamic averaging. We call a device based on these principles an ensemble quantum computer. Our results show that it is indeed possible to prepare a pseudo-pure state in a macroscopic liquid sample under ambient conditions, to transform it into a coherent superposition, to apply elementary quantum logic gates to this superposition, and to convert it into the equivalent of an entangled state. Specifically, we have: - implemented the quantum XOR gate in two different ways, one using Pound-Overhauser double resonance, and the other using a spin-coherence double resonance pulse sequence; - demonstrated that the square root of the Pound-Overhauser XOR corresponds to a conditional rotation, thus confirming that NMR spectroscopy provides a universal set of gates; - devised a spin-coherence implementation of the Toffoli gate, and confirmed that it transforms the equilibrium state of a four-spin system as expected; - used standard gradient-pulse techniques in NMR to equalize all but one of the populations in a two-spin system, thus obtaining the basic pseudo-pure state that corresponds to |00〉; - validated that one can identify which basic pseudo-pure state is present by transforming it into one-spin superpositions, whose associated spectra jointly characterize the state; - applied the spin-coherence XOR gate to a one-spin superposition to create an entangled state, and confirmed its existence by detecting the associated double-quantum coherence via gradient-echo methods. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

While the theory of quantum computing is fairly well understood, it has proved difficult to implement quantum computers in real physical systems. It has recently been shown that nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be used to implement small quantum computers using the spin states of nuclei in carefully chosen small molecules. Here we demonstrate the use of a NMR quantum computer based on the pyrimidine base cytosine, and the implementation of a quantum algorithm to solve Deutsch's problem (distinguishing between constant and balanced functions). This is the first successful implementation of a quantum algorithm on any physical system. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.","","","","","","","","","Feynman R.P., Int. J. Theor.

An analysis of the system efficiency is presented, as well as a description of our error detection protocol, which employs a two-dimensional parity check scheme. Finally, the susceptibility of this system to eavesdropping by various techniques is determined, and the effectiveness of privacy amplification procedures is discussed.

Axial, helical and general (cone, tetrahedron, etc) spin structures of carbon clusters, manganese oxide clusters and iron-sulfur clusters were investigated using the classical Heisenberg model and generalized Hartree-Fock theory. The spin flustrations in the clusters were also studied in relation to theoretical descriptions of the magnetism and the chemical bonds in active sites of several enzymes. The macroscopic quantum tunneling and coherence of spins in the manganese oxide clusters were analyzed using the instanton model, and the tunneling rate of spins was calculated by the coherent state path integral method. The spin transitions induced by an external magnetic field were studied by the path integral Monte Carlo method. The theoretical results were explained in terms of the symmetry and broken symmetry of the wavefunctions in the mesoscopic molecular systems, which are intermediate in the scale factor. The results were also applied to molecular design of mesoscopic clusters of clusters in the intermediate and strong correlation regime. The active control of spins is finally discussed from the viewpoint of functionalities in molecular and biological materials, and technological applications of mesoscopic molecular magnets are discussed with regard to quantum computing.","Mesoscopic molecular magnets;

The special structure of the recursion formula being the core of this algorithm makes it a good starting point to obtain systematically fast Fourier transforms for solvable groups on a quantum computer. The inherent structure of the Hilbert space imposed by the qubit architecture suggests to consider groups of order 2nfirst (where n is the number of qubits). As an example, fast quantum Fourier transforms for all 4 classes of nonabelian 2-groups with cyclic normal subgroup of index 2 are explicitly constructed in terms of quantum circuits.

This brief historical review of the evolution of high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy ventures to highlight the names of a small number of key pioneers who set the subject moving in new directions. Of course, there were scores of others who developed the subject over the years; only a select few have been picked out here for special mention. We shall see that these scientists often had a difficult time gaining acceptance for their innovations; indeed, this is a common theme throughout the story. At first, magnetic resonance did not seem to fit in with contemporary ideas about what was important in chemistry, there was resistance to the introduction of heavy iron magnets into the laboratory, and few believed that the technique could compete with, say, infrared spectroscopy. Yet high-resolution NMR boasted many fascinating new features that the existing classical spectroscopies lacked at that time - coherent radiation, relaxation effects, and, in particular, a unique ability to be manipulated in different ways - for example, by double resonance. As the subject developed, these manipulations became so intricate that it would be fair to say that a new science of ""spin choreography"" was born, in which the nuclear spins were made to perform a complex dance designed to extract all kinds of useful molecular information. NMR became a science worthy of study in its own right. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Cross-polarization; Double resonance; Dynamic nuclear polarization; Fourier transform methods; High-resolution NMR; Historical development; Magnetic fields; Nuclear Overhauser effect; Pioneers; Quantum computers; Solid-state NMR; Spin choreography; Spin echoes","","","","","","","","Purcell E.M., Torrey H., Pound R.V., Phys Rev, 69, (1946); Bloch F., Hansen W., Packard M.E., Phys Rev, 70, (1946); Arnold J.T., Dharmatti S.S., Packard M.E., J Chem Phys, 19, (1951); Arnold J.T., Phys Rev, 102, (1956); Anderson W.A., Phys Rev, 102, (1956); Nelson F.A., Weaver H.E., Science, 146, (1964); Hahn E.L., Phys Rev, 80, (1950); Carr H.Y., Purcell E.M., Phys Rev, 94, (1954); Meiboom S., Gill D., Rev Sci Instr, 29, (1958); Hahn E.L., Maxwell D.E., Phys Rev, 84, (1951); Aue W.P., Bartholdi E., Ernst R.R., J Chem Phys, 64, (1976); Morris G.A., Freeman R., J Am Chem Soc, 101, (1979); Gershenfeld N.A., Chuang I.L., Science, 275, (1997); Andrew E.R., Bradbury A., Eades R.G., Nature, 182, (1958); Lowe I., Phys Rev Lett, 2, (1959); Pines A., Gibby M.G., Waugh J.S., J Chem Phys, 59, (1973); Hartmann S.R., Hahn E.L., Phys Rev, 128, (1962); Kupce E., Freeman R., J Am Chem Soc, 114, (1992); Braunschweiler L., Ernst R.R., J Magn Reson, 53, (1983); Bax A., Davis D.G., J Magn Reson, 65, (1985); Overhauser A.W., Phys Rev, 92, (1953); Overhauser A.W., Encyclopaedia of Magnetic Resonance, 1, (1996); Carver T.R., Slichter C.P., Phys Rev, 92, (1953); Vuister G.W., Boelens R., Kaptein R., J Magn Reson, 80, (1988); Varian R.H.; Freeman R., The Fourier transform revolution in NMR spectroscopy, Anal Chem, 65, (1993); Ernst R.R., Anderson W.A., Rev Sci Instr, 37, (1966); Cooley J.W., Tukey J.W., Math Comput, 19, (1965); Jeener J., NMR and More: In Honour of Anatole Abragam, (1994); Bodenhausen G., Ruben D.J., Chem Phys Lett, 69, (1980); Marion D., Kay L.E., Sparks S.W., Torchia D.A., Bax A., J Am Chem Soc, 111, (1989); Bax A., Freeman R., Kempsell S.P., J Am Chem Soc, 102, (1980); Bax A., Freeman R., Frenkiel T.A., J Am Chem Soc, 103, (1981); Bodenhausen G., Freeman R., Turner D.L., J Magn Reson, 27, (1977); Wokaun A., Ernst R.R., Chem Phys Lett, 52, (1977); Bax A., De Jong P.G., Mehlkopf A.F., Smidt J., Chem Phys Lett, 69, (1980); Barker P., Freeman R., J Magn Reson, 64, (1985); Hurd R.E., J Magn Reson, 87, (1990); Levitt M.H., Freeman R., J Magn Reson, 43, (1981); Freeman R., Kupce E., NMR Biomed, 10, (1997); Tjandra N., Bax A., Science, 278, (1997); Shor P., Proceedings of the 35th Annual Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 124-134, (1994); Grover L.K., Phys Rev Lett, 79, (1997); Cory D.G., Price M.D., Havel T.F., Physica D, 120, pp. 82-101, (1998); Chuang I.L., Vandersypen L.M.K., Zhou X., Leung D.W., Lloyd S., Nature, 393, (1998); Jones J.A., Mosca M., J Chem Phys, 109, (1998); Linden N., Barjat H., Freeman R., Chem Phys Lett, 296, (1998)","R.

In principle, this permits them to solve certain problems exponentially faster than a classical computer, but no one has yet succeeded in implementing a true quantum computer on more than two quantum bits. Recently, however, it has been found that an ensemble of independent and identical quantum computers can perform most of the same feats that a single quantum computer could, while at the same time bringing massive classical parallelism to bear on its computations. Such an ensemble quantum computer can be realized, to a limited extent, by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on ordinary liquids at room temperature and pressure. This simple implementation depends on special kinds of mixed states, called pseudo-pure states, whose preparation entails a loss of signal that is exponential in the number of spins. While this would appear to limit such an implementation to ca. 8-10 spins in the foreseeable future, NMR spectroscopy has now permitted the first experimental demonstrations of all the basic features of quantum computing. We claim, moreover, that the product operator formalism, on which the theory of NMR spectroscopy is based, provides an efficient framework within which to analyze algorithms and decoherence effects in quantum computing more generally. This is illustrated by presenting our recent experimental implementation of a quantum error correcting code.","","Algorithms; Coherent light; Error correction; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Parallel processing systems; Problem solving; Quantum interference phenomena; Quantum computing; Quantum electronics","","","","","","","Lloyd S., A potentially realizable quantum computer, Science, 263, pp. 1569-1571, (1993); Divincenzo D., Quantum computation, Science, 270, pp. 255-261, (1995); Ekert A., Jozsa R., Quantum computation and Shor's factorizing algorithm, Rev.

We explore the possibility of applying this approach to quantum mechanisms; the specialties of the quantum domain seem to yield a richer result. First parts are made independent of each other by assuming that Connections are removed. The overall state would thus become a superposition of tensor products of the eigenstates of the independent parts. Connections are restored by projecting off all the tensor products which violate them. This would be performed by particle statistics, under a special interpretation thereof. The NP-complete problem of testing the satisfiability of a Boolean network is approached in this way. The diakoptic approach appears to be potentially able of taming the quantum whole without clipping its richness. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.","","Computational complexity; NASA; Quantum computers; Tensors; Boolean Networks; Eigenstates; Mechanical connections; Particle statistics; Quantum domain; Satisfiability; Tensor products; Quantum communication","","","","","","","Kron G., ""The Piecewise Solution of Large-Scale Systems"", (1963); Castagnoli G., Rasetti M., Int.

A classical algorithm can be considered as T iterated applications of black box representing f, beginning with input word x of length n. It is proved that if T = O(2 n/7 + ε), ε > 0, and f is chosen randomly then with probability 1 every quantum computer requires not less than T evaluations of f to obtain the result of classical computation. It means that the set of classical algorithms admitting quantum speeding up has probability measure zero. The second result is that for arbitrary classical time complexity T and f chosen randomly with probability 1 every quantum simulation of classical computation requires at least Ω(√T) evaluations of f.","","Algorithms; Computational complexity; Computer simulation; Probability; Quantum theory; Set theory; Probability measure zero; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics","","","","","","","Bennett C.H., Bernstein E., Brassard G., Vazirani U., Strenths and weaknesses of quantum computing, SIAM Journal on Computing, 26, 5, pp. 1510-1523, (1997); Berthiaume A., Brassard G., Oracle quantum computing, Journal of Modern Optics, 41, 12, pp. 2521-2535, (1994); Beals R., Buhrman H., Cleve R., Mosca M., De Wolf R., Tight Quantum Bounds by Polynomials, (1998); Bernstein E., Vazirani U., Quantum complexity theory, Proc. of the 25th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 11-20, (1993); Bennett C.H., Logical reversibility of computation, IBM.

For computers using atoms as qubits, magnetic dipole-dipole interactions are likely to be dominant; various types of errors which they might introduce are considered here. The strength of the interaction may be reduced by increasing the distance between qubits, which in general will make the computer slower. For ion-chain based quantum computers the slowing down due to this effect is found to be generally more severe (scaling as a higher power of the number of qubits) than that due to other causes. In particular, this effect alone would be enough to make these systems unacceptably slow for large-scale computation, whether they use the center of mass motion as the ""bus"" (to store and exchange information between ions) or whether they do this via an optical cavity mode.","Cavity QED; Ion traps; Quantum computing","Error analysis; Fault tolerant computer systems; Hamiltonians; Ions; Magnetic field effects; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics","","","","","","","Knill E., Laflamme R., Zurek W.H., Resilient quantum computation, Science, 279, pp. 342-345, (1998); Preskill J., Reliable quantum computers, Proc.

In such laboratory studies it is convenient to have access to a wide array of logic gates. Here a systematic approach to reduce the logic gate to an NMR pulse sequence is introduced. This approach views the truth table for a quantum logic operation as a permutation matrix that corresponds to a propagator for an NMR transition. This propagator is then used as the starting point for the derivation of a pulse sequence. Pulse sequences for all the permutations of a four level system are reported along with implementations of representative examples on a two spin-1/2 system, 13C-labeled chloroform. © 1999 Academic Press.","","Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; article; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy","","","","","Harvard; MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; U.S. Army, (DAAG55-97-1-0342)","This work was supported by the U.S. Army research office Grant DAAG55-97-1-0342 under the DARPA Ultrascale Computing Program.

The initialization of phases is a problem when the system is initially present in a superposition state as well as in the application of the quantum gate transformations, since each gate will introduce phase uncertainty. The accumulation of these random phases will reduce the effectiveness of the recently proposed quantum computing schemes. The paper also presents general observations on the nonlocal nature of quantum errors and the expected performance of the recently proposed quantum error-correction codes that are based on the assumption that the errors are either bit-flip or phase-flip or both. It is argued that these codes cannot directly solve the initialization problem of quantum computing.","","","","","","","","","Deutsch D., Quantum computational networks, Proc. R. Soc. Lond.

The equilibrium positions of pairs of ions that are crystallized in this trap lie along the long axis of the ellipse. By adding a static potential to the trap, the micromotion of two crystallized ions may be reduced relative to the case of pure rf confinement. The presence of micromotion reduces the strength of internal transitions in the ion, an effect that is characterized by a Debye-Waller factor, in analogy with the reduction of Bragg scattering at finite temperature in a crystal lattice. We have demonstrated the dependence of the rates of internal transitions on the amplitude of micromotion, and we propose a scheme to use this effect to differentially address the ions.","Ion traps; Laser cooling and trapping; Quantum computing; Quantum logic","Cooling; Crystal lattices; Crystallization; Ions; Laser beam effects; Light scattering; Thermal effects; Ion traps; Quantum computing; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Shor P.W., Proc. of the 35th Annual Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 124-134, (1994); Grover L.K., Phys.

Firstly, we argue that the act of 'doing nothing' on part of an entangled quantum system is a highly non-trivial operation and that it is the essential ingredient underlying the computational speedup in the known quantum algorithms. Secondly, we show that the watched pot effect of quantum measurement theory gives the following novel computational possibility: suppose that we have a quantum computer with an on/off switch, programmed ready to solve a decision problem. Then (in certain circumstances) the mere fact that the computer would have given the answer if it were run, is enough for us to learn the answer, even though the computer is in fact not run.","","Algorithms; Computer science; Computers; Data processing; Error correction; Quantum algorithms; Quantum computer; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Jozsa R., Proc.

The existence and general constructions of efficient quantum codes that do not have such an un- derlying structure have remained elusive. Recently, specific examples of nonadditive quantum codes with minimum distance 2 have been presented. We, however, show that there exist infinitely many non-trivial nonadditive codes with different minimum distances, and high rates. In fact, we show that nonadditive codes that correct t errors can reach the asymptotic rate R = 1 − 2H2(2t/n), where H2(x) is the binary entropy function. In the process, we also develop a general set of sufficient conditions for a quantum code to be nonadditive. Finally, we introduce the notion of strongly nonadditive codes, and provide a construction for an ((11,2,3)) strongly nonadditive code. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.","Additive code; Gilbert-Varshamov bound; Quantum code","Additives; Codes (symbols); NASA; Quantum computers; Quantum noise; Asymptotic rate; Entropy function; Gilbert-Varshamov bound; Linear codes; Minimum distance; Non-additive; Quantum codes; Quantum error correcting codes; Quantum communication","","","","","","","Bennett C.H., Divincenzo D.P., Smolin J.A., Wootters W.K., Mixed state entanglement and quantum error correction, Phys.

The usefulness of a quantum computer is limited by the effect of two different types of errors, decoherence and inaccuracies. In this paper we show the results of simulations of a quantum computer which consider both decoherence and inaccuracies. We simulate circuits which factor the numbers 15, 21, 35, and 57 as well as circuits which use database search to solve the circuit satisfaction problem. Our simulations show that the error rate per gate is on the order of 10-6 for a trapped ion quantum computer whose noise is kept below π/4096 per gate and with a decoherence rate of 10-6. This is an important bound because previous studies have shown that a quantum computer can factor more efficiently than a classical computer if the error rate is of order 10-6. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.","Database search; Factoring; Ion trap; Quantum simulation","Database systems; Errors; Information retrieval; Ions; NASA; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Qubits; Search engines; Trapped ions; Database searches; Decoherence; Decoherence rates; Factoring; Ion traps; Quantum simulations; Satisfaction problem; Trapped ion; Quantum communication","","","","","","","Barenco A., Et al., Elementary Gates for Quantum Computation, Phys.

This architecture could be visualized as a quantum Turing machine with a cyclic “tape”. Rather than input-output-relations we investigate the resulting process, i.e. the correlation between one- and two-point expectation values (“correlations”) over various time-steps. The resulting spatiotemporal pattern exhibits many non-classical features including Zeno-effects, violation of temporal Bell-inequalities and quantum parallelism. Due to the strange web of correlations being built-up, specific measurement outcomes for the tape may refer to one or several preparation histories of the head. Specific families of correlation functions are more stable with respect to dissipation than the total wave-function. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.","","NASA; Quantum computers; Turing machines; Wave functions; Bell inequalities; Correlation function; Expectation values; Input-output relations; Quantum gate operations; Quantum parallelism; Quantum turing machine; Spatiotemporal patterns; Quantum communication","","","","","","","Ekert A., Jozsa R., Rev.

Isolated errors can be corrected by using quantum codewords that represent a logical qubit in a redundant way, by several physical qubits. On the other hand, slow drifts can be reduced, but not completely eliminated, by means of symmetrization, namely by using many replicas of the computer, and forcing their joint quantum state to be completely symmetric.

While the information is stored in the atom, unitary transformations can be carried out on the state of the atom allowing the possibility of quantum computing within this single atom.

Biomolecular Computation (BMC) is MC using biotechnology techniques, e.g. recombinant DNA operations. In contrast, Quantum Computation (QC) is a type of computation where unitary and measurement operations are executed on linear superpositions of classical states. Both BMC and QC may be executed at the micromolecular scale by a variety of methodologies and technologies. This paper surveys various methods for doing BMC and QC and discusses the considerable theoretical and practical advances in BMC and QC made in the last few years. We compare bounds on key resource such as time, volume (number of molecules times molecular density), energy and error rates achievable, taking particular note of the scalability of these methods with the size of the problem solved. In addition to NP search problems and database search problems, we enumerate a wide variety of further potential practical applications of BMC and QC. We observe that certain problems if solved with polynomial time bounds appear to require exponentially large volume for BMC (e.g., NP search problems) and QC (e.g., the observation operation). We discuss techniques for decreasing errors in BMC (e.g., annealing errors) and QC (e.g., decoherence errors), and volume where possible, to insure the scalability of BMC and QC to problems of large input size.

We prove linear lower bounds for both exact protocols, as well as for protocols that determine the answer with bounded-error probability. Our proofs employ a novel kind of “quantum” reduction from a quantum information theory problem to the problem of computing the inner product. The communication required for the former problem can then be bounded by an application of Holevo’s theorem.

A suitably designed spin system can support localized excitations (quasiparticles) that exhibit long-range nonabelian Aharonov-Bohm interactions. Quantum information encoded in the charges of the quasiparticles is highly resistant to decoherence, and can be reliably processed by carrying one quasiparticle around another. If information is encoded in pairs of quasiparticles, then the Aharonov-Bohm interactions can be adequate for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.","","Fault tolerance; NASA; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Statistical mechanics; Decoherence; Fault-tolerant quantum computation; Localized excitations; Quantum Information; Quantum statistics; Quasiparticles; Spatial dimension; Spin systems; Quantum communication","","","","","","","Feynman R.P., Simulating physics with computers, Int.

Firstly, we argue that the act of ""doing nothing"" on part of an entangled quantum system is a highly non-trivial operation and that it is the essential ingredient underlying the computational speedup in the known quantum algorithms. Secondly, we show that the watched pot effect of quantum measurement theory gives the following novel computational possibility: suppose that we have a quantum computer with an on/off switch, programmed ready to solve a decision problem. Then (in certain circumstances) the mere fact that the computer would have given the answer if it were run, is enough for us to learn the answer, even though the computer is in fact not run. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.","","Computation theory; Decision theory; Measurement theory; NASA; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Decision problems; Entangled quantum systems; Non-trivial; On/off switch; Quantum algorithms; Quantum effects; Quantum measurement theories; Quantum physics; Quantum communication","","","","","","","Jozsa R., Proc.

Decoherence of the qubits caused by the inevitable interaction with the noisy environment is the major obstacle to realization of quantum computation. A recent innovative discovery is that reliable quantum computation is possible provided that the error per operation caused by decoherence is below a threshold value. The estimated threshold error rate is about 10-6. With the present technology, the real noise seems necessarily beyond this threshold. Therefore, it is essentially important to further suppress noise before taking the procedure of fault-tolerant quantum error correction. We propose a noise suppression scheme which operates by applying a sequence of bit-flipping and phase-flipping pulses on the system, with the pulse period less than the noise correlation time. © 1999 IEEE.","","Error correction; Errors; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Error correction; Quantum theory; Bit flipping; Classical counterpart; Fault-tolerant; Noise correlation; Noise suppression; Noisy environment; Quantum error corrections; Threshold-value; Pulsed controlled noise suppression; Quantum computing; Quantum error correction; Quantum noise; Computation theory","","","","","","","Knill E., Laflamme R., Zurek W.H., Science, 279, (1998); Preskill J., Proc.

Quantum reality, the picture based on unitarily evolving wavefunctions, is complete, but appears incomplete from the observer’s point of view for fundamental reasons arising from the quantum information theory of measurement. Physical reality, the picture based on classically accessible observables is, in the worst case of EPR experiments, unrelated to the quantum reality it purports to re-flect. Thus, quantum information theory implies that only correlations, not the correlata, are physically accessible: the mantra of the Ithaca interpretation of quantum mechanics. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.","","Computation theory; Information theory; NASA; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Einstein-Podolsky-rosen; EPR experiments; Interpretation of quantum mechanics; Physical reality; Quantum information theory; Quantum paradoxes; Quantum reality; Quantum communication","","","","","Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, MPS, (9420470)","","Einstein A., Podolsky B., Rosen N., Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?, Phys.

Less well known perhaps is his long-standing interest in the physics of computation and this is the subject of this paper. Feynman lectured on computation at Caltech for most of the last decade of his life, first with John Hopfield and Carver Mead, and then with Gerry Sussman. The story of how these lectures came to be written up as the Feynman Lectures on Computation is briefly recounted. Feynman also discussed the fundamentals of computation with other legendary figures of the computer science and physics community such as Ed Fredkin, Rolf Landauer, Carver Mead, Marvin Minsky and John Wheeler, He was also instrumental in stimulating developments in both nanotechnology and quantum computing. During the 1980s Feynman re-visited long-standing interests both in parallel computing with Geoffrey Fox and Danny Hillis, and in reversible computation and quantum computing with Charles Bennett, Norman Margolus, Tom Toffoli and Wojciech Zurek. This paper records Feynman's links with the computational community and includes some reminiscences about his involvement with the fundamentals of computing.","","","","","","","","","Feynman R.P., The Feynman Lectures on Computation, (1996); Feynman R.P., Photon-Hadron Interactions, (1972); Goodstein D.L., Richard P.

The quantum lattice-gas transport equation at the microscopic scale is presented as a generalization of the classical latticegas transport equation. A special type of quantum computer network is proposed that is suitable for implementing the quantum lattice gas. The quantum computer network undergoes a partial collapse of the wave- function at every time step of the dynamical evolution. Each quantum computer in the network comprises only a few qubits, which are entangled for only a short time period. A Chapman-Enskog type analysis of the quantum computer network indicates that the total system of qubits behaves exactly like a viscous lattice-gas fluid at the macroscopic scale. Because of the quantum mechanical nature of the scattering process, superposition of outgoing collisional possibilities occurs. The quantum lattice gas obeys detail balance in its collisions and is therefore an unconditionally stable algorithm for fluid dynamics simulation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.","","Computer networks; Crystal lattices; Gases; NASA; Navier Stokes equations; Non Newtonian flow; Quantum chemistry; Quantum communication; Quantum optics; Qubits; Wave functions; Computation of fluid dynamics; Dynamical evolution; Fluid dynamics simulations; Navier-Stokes fluid; Quantum lattice gas; Quantum mechanical; Scattering process; Unconditionally stable algorithms; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Wolfram S., Cellular automaton fluids 1: Basic theory, J.

Assuming an ensemble of equivalent atoms, properties of the local wave function at a given lattice site can be measured using same-position first-order correlations. Statistics of atomic distributions over the lattice can be measured via two-point correlations, generally requiring the averaging of multiple realizations of statistically similar but distinct realizations in order to obtain sufficient signal to noise. Whereas two-point first order correlations are fragile due to phase fluctuations from shot-to-shot in the ensemble, second order correlations are robust. We perform numerical simulations to demonstrate these diagnostic tools. © 1999 Optical Society of America.","","Computer simulation; Fluorescence; Laser applications; Phase transitions; Photons; Signal to noise ratio; Spectroscopic analysis; Atomic wave packets; External probe lasers; Optical lattices; Quantum computing; Optical correlation","","","","","","","Jessen P.S., Deutsch I.H., Optical Lattices, Adv.

Here we explore a new quantification of entanglement of a general (mixed) quantum state for a bipartite system, which we name entanglement of assistance. We show it to be the maximum of the average entanglement over all ensembles con- sistent with the density matrix describing the bipartite state. With the help of lower and upper bounds we calculate entanglement of assistance for a few cases and use these results to show the surprising property of superadditivity.

To date, such designs have either been found by hand or by exhaustive enumeration of all possible circuit topologies. In this paper we propose an automated approach to quantum circuit design using search heuristics based on principles abstracted from evolutionary genetics, i.e. using a genetic programming algorithm adapted specially for this problem. We demonstrate the method on the task of discovering quantum circuit designs for quantum teleportation. We show that to find a given known circuit design (one which was hand-crafted by a human), the method considers roughly an order of magnitude fewer designs than naive enumeration. In addition, the method finds novel circuit designs superior to those previously known. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.","","Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Heuristic algorithms; Integrated circuit manufacture; NASA; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Automated approach; Evolutionary genetics; Exhaustive enumeration; Genetic programming algorithms; Quantum circuit design; Quantum gate operations; Quantum teleportation; Search heuristics; Quantum communication","","","","","","","Aldous D., Vazirani U., Go with the Winners Algorithms, (1997); Barenco A., Bennett C.H., Cleve R., Divincenzo D.P., Margolus N., Shor P., Sleator T., Smolin J., Weinfurter H., Elementary Gates for Quantum Computation, Phys.

These tests include local hidden variables theories, pre- and postselective quantum mechanics, QND measurements, complementarity, and tests of quantum mechanics itself against, e.g., the so-called causal communication constraint. We show how to produce various nonlocal entangled states of multiple cavity fields that are useful for these tests, using cavity QED techniques. First, we discuss the generation of the Bell basis states in two entangled cavities, when there is at most one photon in either of the cavities, and then a straightforward generalization to similar N-cavity states. We then show how to produce a nonlocal entangled state when there is precisely one photon hiding in three cavities. These states can be produced by sending appropriately prepared atoms through the cavities. As applications we briefly review two proposals: one to test quantum mechanics against the causal communication constraint using a two-cavity entangled state and the other to test pre- and postselective quantum mechanics using a three-cavity entangled state. The outcome of the latter experiment can be discussed from the viewpoint of the consistent histories interpretation of quantum mechanics and therefore provides an opportunity to subject quantum cosmological ideas to laboratory tests. Finally, we point out the relation between these schemes and the schemes suggested for quantum computing, teleportation, and quantum copying.","","","","","","","PSC-CUNY; Office of Naval Research, ONR","Discussions with B.-G.

Similarities and differences between ensemble and pure state quantum computing are discussed by using a Liouville space formalism based on polarization and single transition operators. The introduction of an observer spin, that is coupled to the spins carrying the quantum bits, allows a mapping of the states of a quantum computer on a set of transitions between energy levels. This is spectroscopically favorable compared to a mapping on the energy levels themselves. Two complementary parallelization schemes for quantum computing are presented: one exploits the parallel processing feature inherent in multidimensional NMR, while the other employs mixed superposition states represented by operators in Liouville space. The spin swap operation, introduced in this paper, allows a convenient extension of quantum computing to spin systems where not all spin-spin couplings are resolved. The concepts are illustrated by implementations of logic operations and identities consisting of a sequence of basic logic gate operations. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.","","","","","","","","","Shor P.W., SIAM J.

It is shown how N/2+√N calls to the oracle are sufficient to guess the whole content of the oracle (being an N bit string) with probability greater than 95%. This contrasts the power of classical computers which would require N calls to achieve the same task. From this result it follows that any function with the N bits of the oracle as input can be calculated using N/2+√N queries if we allow a small probability of error. It is also shown that this error probability can be made arbitrary small by using N/2+O(√N) oracle queries. In the second part of the article `approximate interrogation' is considered. This is when only a certain fraction of the N oracle bits are requested. Also for this scenario does the quantum algorithm outperform the classical protocols. An example is given where a quantum procedure with N/10 queries returns a string of which 80% of the bits are correct. Any classical protocol would need 6N/10 queries to establish such a correctness ratio.","","Algorithms; Approximation theory; Error analysis; Probability; Quantum theory; Quantum oracle interrogation; Computational complexity","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Comp Soc","IEEE","Proceedings of the 1998 39th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","8 November 1998 through 11 November 1998","Palo Alto, CA, USA","49498","02725428","","ASFPD","","English","Annu Symp Found Comput Sci Proc","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032313975"

The present article outlines the preparation of a class of mixed states, called pseudo-pure states, that emulate pure quantum states in highly mixed solution-state NMR samples. It also describes the NMR observation of spinor behavior in spin 1/2 nuclei, the simulation of wave function collapse using a magnetic field gradient, the creation of entangled (i.e., Bell) pseudo-pure states, and a brief discussion of quantum computing logic gates including the Quantum Fourier Transform. These experiments show that solution-state NMR can be used to demonstrate quantum dynamics at a level suitable for laboratory exercises. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons.

However, in classical computing there is another class of unitary transforms, the wavelet transforms, which are every bit as useful as the Fourier transform. Wavelet transforms are used to expose the multi-scale structure of a signal and are likely to be useful for quantum image processing and quantum data compression. In this paper, we derive efficient, complete, quantum circuits for two representative quantum wavelet transforms, the quantum Haar and quantum Daubechies D(4) transforms. Our approach is to factor the classical operators for these transforms into direct sums, direct products and dot products of unitary matrices. In so doing, we find that permutation matrices, a particular class of unitary matrices, play a pivotal role. Surprisingly, we find that operations that are easy and inexpensive to implement classically are not always easy and inexpensive to implement quantum mechanically, and vice versa. In particular, the computational cost of performing certain permutation matrices is ignored classically because they can be avoided explicitly. However, quantum mechanically, these permutation operations must be performed explicitly and hence their cost enters into the full complexity measure of the quantum trans- form. We consider the particular set of permutation matrices arising in quantum wavelet transforms and develop efficient quantum circuits that implement them. This allows us to design efficient, complete quantum circuits for the quantum wavelet transform. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.","Quantum algorithms and circuits; Quantum computing; Wavelet transforms","Data handling; Discrete wavelet transforms; Fourier transforms; Image processing; Matrix algebra; NASA; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Timing circuits; Wavelet transforms; Classical computing; Multi-scale structures; Permutation operations; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum data compression; Quantum fourier transforms; Quantum image processing; Quantum efficiency","","","","","","","Chuang I.L., Vandersypen L.M.K., Zhou X., Leung D.W., Lloyd S., Experimental realization of a quantum algorithm, Nature, 393, (1998); Jones J.A., Mosca M., Hansen R.H., Implementation of a Quantum Search Algorithm on a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Quantum Computer, Nature, 393, (1998); Chuang I., Yamamoto Y., A Simple Quantum Computer, (1995); Deutsch D., Jozsa R., Rapid solution of problems by quantum computation, Proc.

Emphasis is placed on the decoherence arising from the vibrational motion of the ions, which is compared with that due to spontaneous emission from excited states of the ions. The calculation is made tractable by exploiting the vast difference in time scales between the vibrational excitations and the intra-ionic electronic excitations. Since the latter are several orders of magnitude faster, an adiabatic approximation is used to integrate them out and find the inclusive probability P(t) for the electronic state of the ions to evolve as it would in the absence of vibrational coupling, and the ions to evolve into any state whatsoever. The decoherence time is found at zero temperature and for any number of ions N in the computer. Comparison is made with the spontaneous emission decoherence, and the implications for how trap voltages and other parameters should be scaled with N are discussed.","Adibatic approximation; Ion traps; Quantum coherence; Spontaneous emission","Coherent light; Electron energy levels; Ions; Parallel processing systems; Probability; Spontaneous emission; Quantum computers; Quantum theory","","","","","","","Benioff P., J.

This performance contrasts with the linear growth in the number of steps required by the best classical algorithms, and the exponential number required by classical and quantum methods that ignore the problem structure.

The case of diagonal interactions, previously studied in the context of the quantum Fourier transform algorithm, is also considered. No substantial differences are found between the off-diagonal and diagonal forms of the interaction: in both cases, the errors accumulate almost coherently, despite the fact that the system’s free evolution is constantly being interrupted by the logical gates, which scramble the coefficients of the wave function.

Many designs have been proposed, but none allow a large quantum computer to be built in the near future. Moreover, the known protocols for constructing reliable quantum computers from unreliable components can be complicated, often requiring many operations to produce a desired transformation. Here we show how a single technique a generalization of quantum teleportation - reduces resource requirements for quantum computers and unifies known protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computation. We show that single quantum bit (qubit) operations, Bell-basis measurements and certain entangled quantum states such as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states - all of which are within the reach of current technology are sufficient to construct a universal quantum computer. We also present systematic constructions for an infinite class of reliable quantum gates that make the design of fault-tolerant quantum computers much more straightforward and methodical.","","article; computer; mathematical computing; priority journal; quantum theory","","","","","","","Shor P., Proc. 35th Annu.

Like its classical counterpart introduced by Carnot, this engine carries out a reversible process in which an input of energy to the system results in a separation of cold and hot regions. The method begins with a reinterpretation in thermodynamic terms of a simple step introduced by von Neumann to extract fair coin flips from sequences of biased coin flips. Some of the experimental set-ups proposed for implementation of quantum computers, begin with the quantum bits of the computer initially in a mixed state. Each qubit is ε polarized - in the state |0〉 with probability 1+ε/2, and in the state |1〉 with probability 1-ε/2, independently (or nearly so) of all other bits. The heat engine may be used to transform this initial collection of n qubits into a state in which a near-optimal m = n[1+ε/2 lg(1+ε)+1-ε/2 lg(1-ε)-o(1)] qubits are in the joint state |0m〉. These qubits can then be used as the registers for a quantum computation. The heat engine is described at the level of an algorithm implementable in any quantum system capable of massive coherent states.

The two levels consist of charge states (differing by 2e, where e is the electronic charge) that are coupled by tunnelling of Cooper pairs through the junction. Although the two-level system is macroscopic, containing a large number of electrons, the two charge states can be coherently superposed. The Cooper-pair box has therefore been suggested as a candidate for a quantum bit or 'qubit' - the basic component of a quantum computer. Here we report the observation of quantum oscillations in a single-Cooper-pair box. By applying a short voltage pulse via a gate electrode, we can control the coherent quantum state evolution: the pulse modifies the energies of the two charge states nonadiabatically, bringing them into resonance. The resulting state - a superposition of the two charge states - is detected by a tunnelling current through a probe junction. Our results demonstrate electrical coherent control of a qubit in a solid-state electronic device.","","analytic method; article; conductance; electric potential; electrode; mathematical analysis; oscillation; priority journal; quantum mechanics; solid state","","","","","","","Bouchiat V., Vion D., Joyez P., Esteve D., Devoret M.H., Quantum coherence with a single Cooper pair, Physica Scripta T, 76, pp. 165-170, (1998); Joyez P., Lafarge P., Filipe A., Esteve D., Devoret M.H., Observation of parity-induced suppression of Josephson tunneling in the superconducting single electron transistor, Phys.

Several applications of this idea are discussed. In particular when S is a N-qubit quantum computer interacting with its environment and script G sign the symmetric group of qubit permutations, the resulting effective dynamics admits noiseless subspaces. Moreover it is shown that the recently introduced iterated-pulses schemes for reducing decoherence in quantum computers fit in this general framework. The noise-inducing component of the Hamiltonian is filtered out by the symmetrization procedure just due to its transformation properties. © 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

The 1/2 spin of a 31P nucleus can be used to represent a quantum bit ('qubit') with a relatively long relaxation time. In a CeP crystal lattice, 31P nuclei are periodically situated in three dimensions at distances of about 12 angstrom. The application of a static magnetic field gradient in one direction causes differences in the Zeeman frequencies of separate nuclei. This allows thousands of distinct qubits to be individually addressed. Initializations of the qubits can be done efficiently by the Pound-Overhauser double resonance effect on the nuclear spins and the antiferromagnetically ordered 4f electron spins of cerium ions. Logic operations can be performed by simple pulse sequences, and computational results after logic operations can be measured by the nuclear magnetic resonance of neighboring nuclei, or the electron resonance of neighboring 4f electrons of cerium ions.","","Cerium compounds; Crystal lattices; Electron resonance; Ions; Magnetic field effects; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Quantum theory; Cerium monophosphide; Double resonance effect; Nuclear spins; Pulse sequence; Quantum bit; Quantum computer; Rare earth monophosphide; Relaxation time; Quantum electronics","","","","","","","Deutsch D., Proc.

We discuss the timescales involved in the problem and the need for good control of the atomic motion, particularly the heating due to exchange of excitation between the atom and the cavity, in order to realize nearly unitary dynamics of the internal atomic states and the cavity mode which is required for several schemes of current interest such as quantum computing. Using a simple model we establish the ultimate effects of the external atomic degrees of freedom on the action of quantum gates. The performance of the gate is characterized by a measure based on the entanglement fidelity and the motional excitation caused by the action of the gate is calculated. We find that schemes which rely on adiabatic passage, and are not therefore critically dependent on laser pulse areas, are very much more robust against interaction with the external degrees of freedom of atoms in the quantum gate.","","Atomic physics; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Laser pulses; Mathematical models; Quantum computing; Quantum electrodynamics (QED); Quantum gates; Quantum optics","","","","","","","Haroche S., Phys.

We have fabricated an artificial two-level system in a quantum dot molecule and have demonstrated quantum mechanical coupling with microwave measurements. Our results suggest that the quantum dot molecule can be used as the most fundamental device in quantum computing, a quantum bit.","","Parallel algorithms; Quantum theory; Semiconductor quantum dots; Quantum computing; Quantum electronics","","","","","","","Mizuta H., Tanoue T., The Physics and Applications of Resonant Tunnelling Diodes, (1995); Verdeyen J.T., Laser Electronics, (1989); Shor P.W., Algorithms for quantum computation: Disrete log and factoring, Proc. 35th Annual Symp.

The pulse sequences are constructed from three carefully chosen controlled-not operations. They offer the possibility of monitoring the state of a spin of low inherent sensitivity by interchanging product operator terms with a second spin of high sensitivity. One of the proposed pulse sequence modules is applicable to both homonuclear and heteronuclear IS systems without the need for frequency-selective pulses. Experiments on the IS protons in uracil at 600 MHz demonstrate several examples of the universal SWAP operation and are matched by simulations based on the Liouville-von Neumann equation.","","","","","","","","","Cory D.G., Fahmy A.F., Havel T.F., Proc.

Previous proposed proofs of security of quantum key distribution contain various technical subtleties. Here, a conceptually simpler proof of security of quantum key distribution is presented. The new insight is the invariance of the error rate of a teleportation channel: We show that the error rate of a teleportation channel is independent of the signals being transmitted. This is because the non-trivial error patterns are permuted under teleportation. This new insight is combined with the recently proposed quantum to classical reduction theorem. Our result shows that assuming that Alice and Bob have fault-tolerant quantum computers, quantum key distribution can be made unconditionally secure over arbitrarily long distances even against the most general type of eavesdropping attacks and in the presence of all types of noises.","Quantum computation; Quantum cryptography; Quantum information; Unconditional security","Codes (symbols); Communication channels (information theory); Data privacy; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Quantum computation; Quantum key distribution; Reduction theorems; Teleportation channels; Unconditional security; Quantum cryptography","","","","","","","Bennett C.H., Brassard G., Proceedings of IEEE Int.

Quantum computers are based on the controlled manipulation of entangled quantum states, which are extremely sensitive to noise and imprecision; active correction of errors must therefore be implemented without causing loss of coherence. Quantum error-correction theory has made great progress in this regard, by predicting error-correcting 'codeword' quantum states. But the coding is inefficient and requires many quantum bits, which results in physically unwieldy fault- tolerant quantum circuits. Here I report a general technique for circumventing the trade-off between the achieved noise tolerance and the scale-up in computer size that is required to realize the error correction. I adapt the recovery operation (the process by which noise is suppressed through error detection and correction) to simultaneously correct errors and perform a useful measurement that drives the computation. The result is that a quantum computer need be only an order of magnitude larger than the logic device contained within it. For example, the physical scale-up factor required to factorize a thousand-digit number is reduced from 1,500 to 22, while preserving the original tolerated gate error rate (10-5) and memory noise per bit (10-7). The difficulty of realizing a useful quantum computer is therefore significantly reduced.","","article; computer system; laser; mathematical analysis; physics; priority journal; problem solving; quantum mechanics","","","","","","","Steane A.M., Quantum computing, Rep.

This quantum example oracle is a natural extension of the traditional PAC example oracle, and it immediately follows that all PAC-learnable function classes are learnable in the quantum model. Furthermore, we obtain positive quantum learning results for classes that are not known to be PAC learnable. Specifically, we show that disjunctive normal form (DNF) is efficiently learnable with respect to the uniform distribution by a quantum algorithm using a quantum example oracle. While it was already known that DNF is uniform-learnable using a membership oracle, we prove that a quantum example oracle with respect to uniform is less powerful than a membership oracle. © 1999 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.","Disjunctive normal form (DNF); Fourier transform; Machine learning; Quantum computing; Quantum example oracle","Fourier transforms; Learning algorithms; Membership functions; Polynomials; Problem solving; Quantum theory; Disjunctive normal form; Quantum computing; Quantum example oracle; Learning systems","","","","","","","Aizenstein H., Hellerstein L., Pitt L., Read-thrice DNF is hard to learn with membership and equivalence queries, Proceedings 33rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 523-532, (1992); Aizenstein H., Pitt L., Exact learning of read-twice DNF formulas, Proceedings 32nd Annual Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science, (1991); Aizenstein H., Pitt L., Exact learning of read-k disjoint DNF and not-so-disjoint DNF, Proceedings 5th Annual Workshop on Computational Learning Theory, pp. 71-76, (1992); Angluin D., Frazier M., Pitt L., Learning conjunctions of Horn clauses, Machine Learning, 9, pp. 147-164, (1992); Angluin D., Kharitonov M., When won't membership queries help?, J.

The construction provides an explicit representation of any such state as a mixture of product states. We give upper and lower bounds on the size of the neighborhood, which show that its extent decreases exponentially with the number of qubits. The bounds show that no entanglement appears in the physical states at any stage of present NMR experiments.

Unfortunately, a widely accepted proof of its security in the presence of source, device, and channel noises has been missing. This long-standing problem is solved here by showing that, given fault-tolerant quantum computers, quantum key distribution over an arbitrarily long distance of a realistic noisy channel can be made unconditionally secure. The proof is reduced from a noisy quantum scheme to a noiseless quantum scheme and then from a noiseless quantum scheme to a noiseless classical scheme, which can then be tackled by classical probability theory.","","article; computer; priority journal; probability; quantum mechanics; telecommunication","","","","","","","Wiesner S., SIGACT News, 15, 1, (1983); Bennett C.H., Brassard G., Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computers, Systems, and Signal Processing, pp. 175-179, (1984); Ekert A.K., Phys.

We solved the eigenvalue problem of the Hamiltonian by using a projection approach, and found that the behavior of the total system is like that of a two-level system with the eigenvectors existing in a dual pair of spaces. Furthermore, we constructed the operators for a quantum logic gate using the entangled states, the eigenvectors of the system. Therefore the interaction between the atoms and the single photon mode cannot introduce any decoherence over the constructed quantum logic gates. Since this approach necessitates solving the eigenvalue problem of the Hamiltonian from first principles, it represents a general formulation for obtaining the spectral decomposition of the Hamiltonian as well as the evolution of the density operator for N two-level atoms interacting with multimode photonic fields; this will be the case independent of whether the system is under equilibrium or not. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.","","","","","","","","","Gilmore R., Narducci L.M., Phys.

The dipolar coupling between nuclear spins manifest in the NMR spectra of molecules oriented by a liquid crystal permits a significant increase in clock frequency, while short spin-lattice relaxation times permit fast recycling of algorithms, and save time in calibration and signal-enhancement experiments. Furthermore, the use of liquid crystal solvents offers scalability in the form of an expanded library of spin-bearing molecules suitable for NMRQC. These ideas are demonstrated with the successful execution of a two-qubit Grover search using a molecule (13C 1HCl3) oriented in a liquid crystal and a clock speed eight times greater than in an isotropic solvent. Perhaps more importantly, five times as many logic operations can be executed within the coherence time using the liquid crystal solvent. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.","","","","","","","","","Chuang I.L., Gershenfeld N., Kubinec M.G., Phys.

In this model, there are two separate layers of neurons connected together, the number of neurons in both layer and connections between them is equal to the number of total elements of input signals, the weight updating is managed through a sequence of operations among some unitary transformation and operation matrixes, so the conventional repeated learning procedure was modified to learn just once and an algorithm was developed to realize this new learning method. With a typical classification example, the performance of PSOM demonstrated convergence results similar to Kohonen's model. Theoretic analysis and proofs also showed some interesting properties of PSOM. As it was pointed out, the contribution of such a network may not be so significant, but its parallel mode may be interesting for quantum computation.","","Learning systems; Parallel algorithms; Parallel processing systems; Pattern recognition; Learning algorithms; Maps; Quantum theory; Competitive learning; Quantum computing; Self organizing map; Parallel processing; Quantum computation; Neural networks","","","","","","","","","","Allerton Press Inc","","","","","","10036326","","TNMCE","","English","Trans Nonferrous Met Soc China","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032590429"

It is expected that such a theory will include a coherent combination of mathematical logical concepts with quantum mechanics. That this might be possible is shown here by defining truth, validity, consistency, and completeness for a quantum-mechanical version of a simple (classical) expression enumeration machine described by Smullyan. Some of the expressions are chosen as sentences denoting the presence or absence of other expressions in the enumeration. Two of the sentences are self-referential. It is seen that, for an interpretation based on a Feynman path sum over expression paths, truth, consistency, and completeness for the quantum system have different properties than for the classical system. For instance, the truth of a sentence S is defined only on those paths containing S. It is undefined elsewhere. Also S and its negation can both be true provided they appear on separate paths. This satisfies the definition of consistency. The definitions of validity and completeness connect the dynamics of the system to the truth of the sentences. It is proved that validity implies consistency. It is seen that the requirements of validity and maximal completeness strongly restrict the allowable dynamics for the quantum system. Aspects of the existence of a valid, maximally complete dynamics are discussed. An exponentially efficient quantum computer is described that is also valid and complete for the set of sentences considered here. © 1999 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Shor P., Proceedings, 35th Annual Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 124-134, (1994); SIAM J.

The 1/2 spin of a 31P nucleus can be used to represent a quantum bit ('qubit') with a relatively long relaxation time. In a CeP crystal lattice, 31P nuclei are periodically situated in three dimensions at distances of about 6 Å. The application of a static magnetic field gradient in one direction causes differences in the Zeeman frequencies of separate nuclei. This allows thousands of distinct qubits to be individually addressed. Initializations of the qubits can be done efficiently by the Pound-Overhauser double resonance effect on the nuclear spins and the antiferromagnetically ordered 4 f electron spins of cerium ions. Logic operations can be performed by simple pulse sequences, and computational results after logic operations can be measured by the nuclear magnetic resonance of neighboring nuclei, or the electron resonance of neighboring 4 f electrons of cerium ions. © Springer-Verlag 1999.","","Antiferromagnetism; Cerium compounds; Crystal lattices; Electron resonance; Magnetic field effects; Magnetization; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Quantum theory; Relaxation processes; Cerium monophosphide; Quantum computers; Computers","","","","","","","Deutsch D., Proc.

That is, they considered the representation of binary numbers as two levels of the quantum system. The representation of a single bit of information in this form has come to be known as a qubit. That the brain utilizes quantum superposition of its states is not a new idea. There are many models considering the necessity of quantum processes for brain functioning. Some aspects of the brain functions leads to the probable necessity to resolve the problem of consciousness only by means of classical physics. The quantum mechanical superposition principle enables a quantum computer to perform certain computations much more efficiently than any classical computer. Considering these concepts in connection with neurophysiological data enables to grasp some unresolved problems of synchronization among neurons in neural networks without their total convergency. These arguments give some implications for electroencephalography and for testing relations between the brain and psychic processes.

All NMR quantum computing experiments performed so far with three quantum bits can be accounted for in this classical model. After a few entangling gates, the classical model suffers an exponential decrease of the measured signal, whereas there is no corresponding decrease in the quantum description. We suggest that for small numbers of quantum bits, the quantum nature of NMR quantum computation lies in the ability to avoid an exponential signal decrease. © 1999 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Cory D.G., Fahmy A.F., Havel T.F., Proc.

First, we give a tight analysis of the trade-offs between the number of queries of quantum search algorithms, their error probability, the size of the search space, and the number of solutions in this space. Using this, we deduce new lower and upper bounds for quantum versions of amplification problems. Next, we establish nearly optimal quantum-classical separations for the query complexity of monotone functions in the zero-error model (where our quantum zero-error model is defined so as to be robust when the quantum gates are noisy). Also, we present a communication complexity problem related to a total function for which there is a quantum-classical communication complexity gap in the zero-error model. Finally, we prove separations for monotone graph properties in the zero-error and other error models which imply that the evasiveness conjecture for such properties does not hold for quantum computers.","","Computational complexity; Errors; Functions; Graph theory; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Probability; Problem solving; Quantum theory; Theorem proving; Monotone functions; Probabilistic algorithm; Quantum algorithms; Small error probability; Zero error model; Algorithms","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society","Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE 40th Annual Conference on Foundations of Computer Science","17 October 1999 through 19 October 1999","New York, NY, USA","56152","02725428","","ASFPD","","English","Annu Symp Found Comput Sci Proc","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033309275"

More specifically, an entropic no-cloning inequality is derived for a Hilbert space of arbitrary dimension, which describes the tradeoff between the losses of the channels leading to the two copies. Then, focusing on quantum bits, a family of Pauli cloning machines is introduced. These machines produce two imperfect copies of a single quantum bit that emerge from two distinct Pauli channels. The balance between the quality of the two copies is shown to result from a genuine complementarity principle. In the special probability p and p′, the domain in (√p, √p′-spacelocatedginsideaeparticular ellipse representing close-to-perfect cloning is forbidden. Finally, the class of symmetric Pauli cloning machines is used to provide an upper py and pz. The capacity is proven to be vanishing if (√px, √py, √pz) lies outside an ellipsoid whose pole coincides with the depolarizing channel that underlies the universal cloning machine. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.","","Clone cells; Cloning; Communication channels (information theory); NASA; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Arbitrary dimension; Cloning machine; Information-theoretic approach; Noisy quantum channel; Pauli channels; Probability p; Single quantum; Transmission quality; Quantum communication","","","","","","","Dieks D., Phys.

We show that such selective gates, termed [Formula Presented] gates, or [Formula Presented] gates, are convenient in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) implementations of QIP and are straightforward to implement. NMR pulse sequences for these gates can be built using classical methods as well as insights from geometric algebra. These methods yield equivalent NMR pulse sequences for the generation of [Formula Presented] gates for any number of control spins.

Individual electrons are laterally confined by micrometer- sized metal pads below the helium. Information is stored in the lowest hydrogenic levels. With electric fields, at temperatures of 10-2 kelvin, changes in the wave function can be made in nanoseconds. Wave function coherence times are 0.1 millisecond.

The fabrication of such ultrasmall area planar SIS junctions had previously only been achieved using electron beam lithography (JPL). Typical techniques for the fabrication of micron-scale SIS junctions involve a self-aligned resist lift-off process. The resist pattern is used to define both the junction counter-electrode and the insulation field that separates the wiring layer from the base electrode. The wiring layer contacts the junction counter-electrode through a via in the insulation field that is created during resist liftoff. In our process, the junction is defined and insulated in separate steps; a via through the insulation layer to the junction is aligned and defined using a gallium focused ion beam with nanometer spot-size. Such small area SIS junctions have potential applications in high frequency SIS mixer circuits. They may also be used in experiments to investigate quantum coherence in superconducting circuits and may even serve as the key elements in future superconducting quantum computers. © 1999 IEEE.","","Electrodes; Gallium; Integrated circuits; Ion bombardment; Niobium compounds; Superconducting materials; Focused ion beam; Machine aligned technique; Superconducting insulating superconducting tunnel junctions; Tunnel junctions","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (AST-9618747); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (NAG5-6084)","Manuscript received September 15, 1998.

The qubit consists of a micrometer-sized loop with three or four Josephson junctions; the two qubit states have persistent currents of opposite direction. Quantum superpositions of these states are obtained by pulsed microwave modulation of the enclosed magnetic flux by currents in control lines. A superconducting flux transporter allows for controlled transfer between qubits of the flux that is generated by the persistent currents, leading to entanglement of qubit information.","","article; computer; electron beam; magnetic field; microwave radiation; priority journal; quantum theory","","","","","","","Lloyd S., Science, 261, (1993); Bennett C.H., Phys.

Throughout we stress the connections between field computation and quantum mechanics, especially including the important role of information fields, which represent by virtue of their form rather than their magnitude. We also show that field computation permits simultaneous nonlinear computation in linear superposition.","","Backpropagation; Computational methods; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Analog computation; Continuum computation; Cortical map; Field computation; Hilbert space; Molecular computer; Molecular computing; Quantum computation; Quantum computer; Radial basis function; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Bizzi E., Mussa-Ivaldi F.A., Toward a neurobiology of coordinate transformation, The Cognitive Neurosciences, pp. 495-506, (1995); Bohm D., Hiley B.J., The Undivided Universe: An Ontological Interpretation of Quantum Theory, (1993); Changeux J.-P., Neuronal Man: The Biology of Mind, (1985); Daugman J.G., Spatial visual channels in the Fourier plane, Vision Res., 24, pp. 891-910, (1984); Dirac P.A.M., The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, Fourth Ed., (1958); Droulez J., Berthoz A., The concept of dynamic memory in sensorimotor control, Motor Control: Concepts and Issues, pp. 137-161, (1991); Droulez J., Berthoz A., A neural network model of sensoritopic maps with predictive short-term memory properties, Proc.

A solid-state quantum computer based on localized electron spins as qubits is therefore of potential interest. Here, a scheme that realizes controlled interactions between two distant quantum dot spins is proposed. The effective long-range interaction is mediated by the vacuum field of a high finesse microcavity. By using conduction-band-hole Raman transitions induced by classical laser fields and the cavity-mode, parallel controlled-not operations, and arbitrary single qubit rotations can be realized. © 1999 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Steane A., Rep.

This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems that are generally thought to be hard on classical computers and that have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, for example, the number of digits of the integer to be factored.","","Computer simulation; Digital computers; Fourier transforms; Number theory; Polynomials; Quantum theory; Random processes; Church thesis; Discrete logarithms; Polynomial time algorithms; Prime factorization; Quantum computers; Spin systems; Algorithms","","","","","","","Abrams D.S., Lloyd S., Simulation of many-body Fermi systems on a universal quantum computer, Phys.

We show how to calculate this effect. No assumptions about the environment are necessary, so this represents a useful model to test the fidelity of quantum error correcting codes. We examine two cases of interest. First, the decoherence from the Walsh-Hadamard transformations in Grover’s search algorithm is found [Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 325 (1997)]. Interference effects, and decoherence-dependent phases, are present that could be useful in reducing the decoherence. Second, Shor’s fault-tolerant controlled-NOT gate is examined, utilizing frequency-selective pulses [Proceedings, 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (IEEE Press, New York, 1994), pp. 56–65]. This implementation is found not to be optimal in regards to fault-tolerant quantum computation. © 1999 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Feynman R., Found.

In this paper, we present two methods for optimizing the physical implementation of such error correction schemes. First, we discuss an optimal quantum circuit implementation of the smallest error-correcting code (the three bit code). Quantum circuits are physically implemented by serial pulses, i.e., by switching on and off external parameters in the Hamiltonian one after another. In contrast to this, we introduce a parallel switching method which allows faster gate operation by switching all external parameters simultaneously, and which has potential applications for arbitrary quantum computer architectures. We apply both serial and parallel switching to electron spins in coupled quantum dots subject to a Heisenberg coupling (Formula presented) We provide a list of steps that can be implemented experimentally and used as a test for the functionality of quantum error correction. © 1999 The American Physical Society.","","","","","","","","","Shor P.W., Proceedings of the 35th Annual Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science, (1994); Feynman R.P., Int.

Results of our numerical simulations show that the coupling constant of the dipole-dipole interaction and the probability of spontaneous emission can be tuned over a wide range by a proper choice of the potential profile, material parameters, and distances between the dots. We argue that the use of the asymmetric potential profile provides better conditions for having the Ising-type interaction between the dots than earlier proposed schemes based on regular symmetric quantum dots biased with an electric field. Our system gives better resolution of different quantum states, avoids any undesirable time evolution of these states, and can be driven with a femtosecond laser. The qubit manipulation and time coherency requirements are also discussed.","","Computer simulation; Electric fields; Laser applications; Quantum theory; Ultrafast phenomena; Quantum computing; Semiconductor quantum dots","","","","","","","Cirac J.I., Zoller P., Phys.

The new basis consists of two single-qubit gates (Hadamard and σz 1/4 ), and one double-qubit gate (Controlled-NOT). Since the set consisting of Controlled-NOT and Hadamard gates is not universal, the new basis achieves universality by including only one additional elementary (in the sense that it does not include angles that are irrational multiples of π) single-qubit gate, and hence, is potentially the simples universal basis that one can construct.

Computation, Quantum Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, United States","Conventional electronics is based on the manipulation of electronic charge. An intriguing alternative is the field of 'spintronics', wherein the classical manipulation of electronic spin in semiconductor devices gives rise to the possibility of reading and writing non-volatile information through magnetism. Moreover, the ability to preserve coherent spin states in conventional semiconductors and quantum dots may eventually enable quantum computing in the solid state. Recent studies have shown that optically excited electron spins can retain their coherence over distances exceeding 100 micrometres (ref. 7). But to inject spin-polarized carriers electrically remains a formidable challenge. Here we report the fabrication of all- semiconductor, light-emitting spintronic devices using III-V heterostructures based on gallium arsenide. Electrical spin injection into a nonmagnetic semiconductor is achieved (in zero magnetic field) using a p-type ferromagnetic semiconductor as the spin polarizer. Spin polarization of the injected holes is determined directly from the polarization of the emitted electroluminescence following the recombination of the holes with the injected (unpolarized) electrons.","","ferromagnetic material; gallium arsenide; manganese; article; device; electron spin resonance; magnetism; priority journal; quantum mechanics; semiconductor; X ray diffraction","","gallium arsenide, 1303-00-0; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5","","","","","Awschalom D.D., Kikkawa J.M., Electron spin and optical coherence in semiconductors, Phys.

An extension of such phenomena to semiconductors should create possibilities for seamless integration of 'spin electronics' with existing solid-state devices, and may someday enable quantum computing schemes using electronic spins as non-local mediators of coherent nuclear spin interactions. But to realize such goals, spin transport must be effected without destroying the relevant spin information. Here we report time, resolved optical studies of non-local Faraday rotation in n-type bulk gallium arsenide, which show macroscopic lateral transport of coherently processing electronic spins over distances exceeding 100 micrometres. The ability to drag these spin packets by their negative charge, without a substantial increase in spin decoherence, is a consequence of the rather weak entanglement of spin coherence with orbital motion in this system.; The importance of spin-transport phenomena in condensed-matter physics has increased over the past decade with the advent of metallic giant-magnetoresistive systems and spin-valve transistors.

The ability to drag these spin packets by their negative charge, without a substantial increase in spin decoherence, is a consequence of the rather weak entanglement of spin coherence with orbital motion in this system.","","Electric excitation; Electric fields; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Electron transport properties; Faraday effect; Light polarization; Magnetic fields; Magnetoresistance; Optical testing; Quantum electronics; Solid state devices; gallium arsenide; article; electronics; magnetic field; molecular dynamics; priority journal; quantum mechanics; semiconductor; Faraday rotation; Resonant spin; Spin coherence; Semiconducting gallium arsenide","","","","","","","Prinz G., Spin-polarized transport, Phys.

In lattices with ordered filling structures, highly parallel entanglement operations could be implemented, corresponding to a novel class of quantum gates. These multi-qubit quantum gates can be employed for efficient quantum error correction.

We determine the exchange coupling (Formula presented) in the effective Heisenberg model as a function of magnetic (Formula presented) and electric fields, and of the interdot distance (Formula presented) within the Heitler-London approximation of molecular physics. This result is refined by using (Formula presented) hybridization, and by the Hund-Mulliken molecular-orbit approach, which leads to an extended Hubbard description for the two-dot system that shows a remarkable dependence on (Formula presented) and (Formula presented) due to the long-range Coulomb interaction. We find that the exchange (Formula presented) changes sign at a finite field (leading to a pronounced jump in the magnetization) and then decays exponentially.

The classical coherence of laser light has been used to guide quantum systems into desired target states through interfering pathways. These experiments used the control of target properties - such as fluorescence from a dye solution, the current in a semi-conductor or the dissociation fraction of an excited molecule - to infer control over the quantum state. Here we report a direct approach to coherent quantum control that allows us to actively manipulate the shape of an atomic electron's radial wavefunction. We use a computer-controlled laser to excite a coherent state in atomic caesium. The shape of the wavefunction is then measured and the information fed back into the laser control system, which reprograms the optical field. The process is iterated until the measured shape of the wavefunction matches that of a target wavepacket, established at the start of the experiment. We find that, using a variation of quantum holography to reconstruct the measured wavefunction, the quantum state can be reshaped to match the target within two iterations of the feedback loop.","","cesium; article; computer system; feedback system; holography; ionization; laser; measurement; photochemistry; priority journal; quantum mechanics; quantum theory","","","","","","","Warren W.S., Rabitz H., Dahleh M., Coherent control of quantum dynamics: The dream is alive, Science, 259, pp. 1581-1589, (1993); Gordon R.J., Rice S.A., Active control of the dynamics of atoms and molecules, Annu.

The computational space is realized by a n-fold degenerate eigenspace of a family of Hamiltonians parametrized by a manifold M. The point of M represents classical configuration of control fields and, for multi-partite systems, couplings between subsystem. Adiabatic loops in the control M induce non trivial unitary transformations on the computational space. For a generic system it is shown that this mechanism allows for universal quantum computation by composing a generic pair of loops in M.

We first give an overview of quantum information processing, showing that the famous Shor speedup of integer factoring is just one of a host of important applications for qubits, including cryptography, counterfeit protection, channel capacity enhancement, distributed computing, and others. We review our proposed spin-quantum dot architecture for a quantum computer, and we indicate a variety of first generation materials, optical, and electrical measurements which should be considered. We analyze the efficiency of a two-dot device as a transmitter of quantum information via the propagation of qubit carriers (i.e. electrons) in a Fermi sea. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.","Entanglement; Quantum coherence; Quantum computing; Quantum dot; Quantum gate","Distributed computer systems; Information science; Nanocrystals; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Semiconductor quantum dots; Channel capacity; Computational complexity; Cryptography; Data processing; Electric variables measurement; Fermi level; Image enhancement; Optical materials; Quantum theory; Transmitters; Capacity enhancement; Counterfeit protection; Electrical measurement; Entanglement; Of quantum-information; Quantum coherence; Quantum Computing; Quantum gates; Quantum computers; Quantum information processing; Quantum revolution; Quantum theory; Magnetic materials","","","","","","","Brassard G., Modern Cryptology, A Tutorial, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 325, (1988); Menezes A.J., van Oorschot P.C., Vanstone S.A., Handbook of Applied Cryptography, (1996); Papadimitriou C.H., Computational Complexity, (1994); Sipser M., Introduction to the Theory of Computation, (1997); Kushelevitz E., Nisan N., Communication Complexity, (1997); Yao A.C.-C., Some complexity questions related to distributive computing, Proceedings of the 11th ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing, (1979); Abramson N., Information Theory and Coding, (1963); Shamir A., Commun.

The implementation of a quantum logic gate imposes certain constraints on the motion of those spins not directly involved in that gate, the so-called 'spectator' spins; they must be returned to their initial states at the end of the sequence. As a result, a homonuclear spin system where there is appreciable coupling between every pair of spins would seem to require a refocusing scheme that doubles in complexity and duration for every additional spectator spin. Fortunately, for the more realistic practical case where long-range spin-spin couplings can be neglected, simpler refocusing schemes can be devised where the overall duration of the sequence remains constant and the number of soft pulses increases only linearly with the number of spectator spins. These ideas are tested experimentally on a six qubit system: the six coupled protons of inosine.","","","","","","","","","Cory D.G., Fahmy A.F., Havel T.F., Proc. Natl. Acad.

Phys., University of Sussex, Brighton BN1 9QH, United Kingdom","For the last decade it has been possible to cool atoms to microkelvin temperatures (approximately 1 cm s-1) using a variety of optical techniques. Light beams provide the very strong frictional forces required to slow atoms from room temperature (approximately 500 m s-1). However, once the atoms are cold, the relatively weak conservative forces of static electric and magnetic fields play an important role. In our group we have been studying the interaction of cold rubidium atoms with periodically magnetized data storage media. Here we review the underlying principles of the forces acting on atoms above a suitably magnetized substrate or near current-carrying wires. We also summarize the status of experiments. These structures can be used as smooth or corrugated reflectors for controlling the trajectories of cold atoms. Alternatively, they may be used to confine atoms to a plane, a line, or a dot and in some cases to reach the quantum limit of confinement. Atoms levitated above a magnetized surface can be guided electrostatically by wires deposited on the surface. The flow and interaction of atoms in such a structure may form the basis of a new technology, `integrated atom optics' which might ultimately be capable of realizing a quantum computer.","","Atoms; Electrostatics; Magnetic levitation; Magnetic storage; Rubidium; Integrated atom optics; Magnetic atom optics; Quantum computer; Particle optics","","","","","","","Stern O., Z.
